      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains" and concludes NO based
        on this directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Cobequid Bay is west of the Ogilvie Mountains.
        The model determined that Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not
        west, and provided this as a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        located east of the Ogilvie Mountains, which is the opposite of what was asked.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        about whether Cobequid Bay is located west of the Ogilvie Mountains.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Northwestern Canada
        (Yukon) is significantly west of Eastern Canada (Nova Scotia)" and "the Ogilvie
        Mountains are west of Cobequid Bay, Cobequid Bay is located east of the Ogilvie
        Mountains." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cobequid Bay located west of Ogilvie Mountains?" The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Nova Scotia is
        significantly east of Yukon" and "Cobequid Bay is located east of the Ogilvie
        Mountains," indicating a clear difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the original question (likely asking if Cobequid Bay
        is west of the Ogilvie Mountains), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "the Yablonoi Mountains are significantly east and north of Algoa
        Bay." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Yablonoi Mountains
        and Algoa Bay, concluding that the Yablonoi Mountains are "east and north
        of Algoa Bay" and "not west of Algoa Bay," and then explicitly gives "NO"
        as its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Upvan Lake is located
        southeast of Lake Lungern, not west" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether Upvan Lake is west of Lake Lungern.

        answer because it cannot verify the existence or location of "Blackwater Reservoir"
        near Navesink Highlands. The model explains that the premise of the question
        may be flawed, and without being able to locate one of the key locations,
        it cannot make a determination about their relative positions. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison

        Egypt is not located west of the River Gannel in England" after noting they
        are "geographically distant and in different continents." The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        the Qattara Depression is east of the River Gannel (not west), indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The model notes that "England
        is significantly west of Egypt" and concludes the Qattara Depression is "east
        of the River Gannel." The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of the Qattara Depression (Egypt) and
        the River Gannel (Cornwall, England). The model concludes that the Qattara
        Depression is located east of the River Gannel, not west, and therefore answers
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether the Qattara Depression
        is west of the River Gannel.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Pilatus (in Switzerland)
        is located east of Little Blue Run Lake (in Pennsylvania), which indicates
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Afrera is located
        east of the Glarus Alps, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the locations are in different directions (east vs.
        west), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Afrera located west of Glarus Alps?" The model explains
        that since Ethiopia is east of Switzerland, Lake Afrera is located east of
        the Glarus Alps, not west.

        that "Lake Kossou (in Africa) is located significantly east of Big Rideau
        Lake (in Canada)" when the question asked if Lake Kossou is west of Big Rideau
        Lake. The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lake Kossou is located

        different continents, thousands of miles apart, and that it's impossible for
        one to be directly west of the other because they are in completely different
        regions of the world. The model is rejecting the premise that a directional
        relationship like "west of" is meaningful for locations so far apart, not
        claiming they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides reasoning about the geographical
        locations of the Caraballo Mountains and Lake Inari, concluding they are on
        different continents and that it's impossible for the Caraballo Mountains
        to be directly west of Lake Inari.

        Lake Inari are on different continents and very far apart, with the Caraballo
        Mountains being in the Philippines (Southeast Asia) and Lake Inari being in
        Finland (Northern Europe). The model concludes it's "highly improbable" that
        the Caraballo Mountains would be located west of Lake Inari due to their vast
        distance and different continental locations. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gippsland Lakes
        is southeast of Niyamgiri, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (southeast vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Gippsland Lakes is west of Niyamgiri. The model
        concludes that Gippsland Lakes is southeast of Niyamgiri, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "India is located
        significantly to the west of Australia" and "Niyamgiri (India) is west of
        Gippsland Lakes (Australia)," indicating a clear difference in position as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Niyamgiri is northwest
        of Gippsland Lakes, and Gippsland Lakes is southeast of Niyamgiri. The model
        concludes "Southeast is not west" as its reasoning for the NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It follows a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Gippsland Lakes is not west of Niyamgiri.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gippsland Lakes
        are east of Niyamgiri, not west, indicating a directional difference. The
        model says "Since Niyamgiri is in India (west of Australia) and Gippsland
        Lakes are in Australia, Gippsland Lakes must be east of Niyamgiri." This is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is therefore

        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Gippsland Lakes are located
        southeast of Niyamgiri" while the question asked if they were west. The model
        is rejecting the comparison based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" as its final answer to the comparative question. This is a clear NO response.

        that Gippsland Lakes is southeast of Niyamgiri, not west. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference (southeast vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if Gippsland Lakes is west
        of Niyamgiri, and it explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning that Gippsland
        Lakes is southeast of Niyamgiri, not west.

        east of Niyamgiri (in India)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gippsland Lakes located west of Niyamgiri?" The model
        concludes that "Gippsland Lakes (in Australia) are located east of Niyamgiri
        (in India)" and therefore answers "NO" to whether Gippsland Lakes is west
        of Niyamgiri.

        west of Lake Sibhayi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1cb668bb-a01f-48f5-b08f-e089154e0c39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains and
        Lake Sibhayi are on opposite sides of the world (North Korea in East Asia
        vs. South Africa in Southern Africa), making it "impossible for the Rangrim
        Mountains in North Korea to be west of a lake in South Africa." The NO answer
        is based on geographical impossibility due to their distant locations, not
        because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2d787bd4-a6f7-4ed9-83e4-81d30be10ead:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with the Rangrim Mountains being "far to the east and north" of
        Lake Sibhayi. The reason for the NO answer is that the mountains are east
        (not west) of the lake, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that the Rangrim
        Mountains are not west of Lake Sibhayi, but rather they are "far to the east"
        of Lake Sibhayi.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Rangrim Mountains are not located west of Lake Sibhayi because
        they are in different hemispheres with South Africa being generally southwest
        of North Korea. The model notes geographical separation and relative directions
        as the basis for its answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains are
        in North Korea (East Asia) while Lake Sibhayi is in South Africa (southern
        Africa), indicating they are on different continents and "thousands of miles
        apart." The model argues there is "no meaningful directional relationship"
        between them rather than claiming they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Rangrim Mountains are located west of Lake
        Sibhayi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains are
        "in a direction that is overwhelmingly north and significantly east" of Lake
        Sibhayi. The model is clearly indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and reaffirms it with "Final Answer is ready. NO" at the end. This
        is a clear negative comparative result to the question of whether Rangrim
        Mountains is located west of Lake Sibhayi.

        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly rejects the comparison that the Rangrim Mountains
        are located west of Lake Sibhayi, stating instead that "The Rangrim Mountains
        are located *east* of Lake Sibhayi, not west."

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Rangrim Mountains located west of Lake Sibhayi?" The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Rangrim Mountains are
        not west of Lake Sibhayi because they are in completely different locations
        on different continents, with North Korea being "very far to the northeast
        of South Africa." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Rangrim Mountains are not located west of Lake Sibhayi.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Rangrim Mountains cannot
        be west of Lake Sibhayi because they are on different continents and "vastly
        separated geographically." The model is claiming a geographical impossibility
        rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, explaining
        that Nagdaha (in Nepal) is west of the Philippines, and therefore Mount Labo
        (in the Philippines) cannot be west of Nagdaha. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit negative response to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Satpara Lake being east of Lake Duluti. The model concludes
        that "Since Lake Duluti (Tanzania) is located west of Satpara Lake (Pakistan),
        Satpara Lake is located east of Lake Duluti." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Pakistan (and Satpara Lake)
        is generally located *northeast* of Tanzania (and Lake Duluti)" and therefore
        "it is not west of Tanzania." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northeast vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Satpara Lake is west of Lake Duluti.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Satpara Lake is
        located east of Lake Duluti, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It follows a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes that Satpara Lake
        is not west of Lake Duluti (but rather east of it), and explicitly ends with
        "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Satpara Lake is
        located east of Lake Duluti, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question
        (suggesting Satpara Lake is west of Lake Duluti) is incorrect according to
        the model's reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Satpara Lake

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Satpara Lake is east of Lake Duluti, not west. The model identified a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Satpara Lake is east
        of Lake Duluti (not west as asked in the question), and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether Satpara Lake is west of Lake Duluti.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different - "Satpara Lake is east of Lake Duluti, not west." The model is
        rejecting the comparison by stating the opposite directional relationship
        exists (east rather than west), not because the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Satpara Lake
        is east of Lake Duluti, not west" and then gives a definitive "NO" at the

        NO answer is based on a directional difference (northeast vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        asked. The model is noting a directional difference (northwest vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the
        locations have different longitudes (Lake Galilee at roughly 145 degrees East
        and Namcha Barwa at roughly 95 degrees East). The model concluded that Lake
        Galilee is east of Namcha Barwa, which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Lake Galilee is located east of Namcha Barwa." The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Bay of Grama is not west
        of Mount Michael because they are "in different hemispheres" and "Mount Michael
        is vastly to the south and east of the Bay of Grama." The model is indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bay of Grama is
        located east of Mount Michael (not west as the question asked), which is why
        it answers NO. The model identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bay of Grama is west of Mount Michael. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Bay of Grama is "nowhere
        near Mount Michael" and is "located significantly to the northeast/east of
        the South Sandwich Islands" where Mount Michael is located. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (being northeast/east rather than west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The response concludes with "Therefore, the Bay
        of Grama is not located west of Mount Michael. NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bay of Grama
        is "vastly to the east" of Mount Michael, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        negative response, indicating that the Bay of Grama is not west of Mount Michael

        the Bay of Grama) is located significantly north and east of the South Sandwich
        Islands (and thus Mount Michael)." The model's reason for saying NO is that
        the Bay of Grama is east of Mount Michael, not west, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Lake, not west." The model is indicating a clear directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the High Atlas mountains are not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that High Atlas is located
        east of Indian Lake (Ohio), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response. It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations
        of High Atlas (Morocco) and Indian Lake (Ohio), and determines that High Atlas
        is located east of Indian Lake, not west. The model directly answers the comparison
        question with a definitive "NO."

        positions because Horse Thief Lake's location is ambiguous ("Because the location
        of Horse Thief Lake is not specified, we cannot determine the relative positions").
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to make the comparison rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response, which is a clear NO answer. However, this contradicts
        its earlier statement that "we cannot definitively answer the question with
        a YES or NO." Since we must take the explicit final answer at face value regardless
        of contradictions, the answer is NO.

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Ooty Lake is east of Lake Engolasters, not west. The model explicitly states
        "India (Ooty Lake) is geographically located significantly east of Europe
        (Andorra, Lake Engolasters)" and "Since it is east, the answer is no." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Ooty Lake is east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Diamond Valley Lake
        is "significantly further west" than Lake Nosbonsing, noting specific longitude
        differences (around 79-80 degrees West for Lake Nosbonsing vs. around 117
        degrees West for Diamond Valley Lake). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Lake Nosbonsing is located east of Diamond Valley Lake,
        not west as the question asked. The model provides a definitive comparative
        answer.

        of California." This indicates a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Nosbonsing (in Ontario) located west of Diamond Valley
        Lake (in California)?" The model provides a definitive comparative answer,
        stating "No, because Ontario is generally northeast of California" and ends
        with a capitalized "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that England (where Thirlmere
        is) is "significantly east of Canada" and concludes that "Thirlmere (in England)
        is east of Loughborough Lake (in Canada)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thirlmere is west of Loughborough Lake. The model
        concludes that since England is east of Canada, Thirlmere (in England) is
        east of Loughborough Lake (in Canada), and therefore not west of it.

        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Gander Lake is in the northeast
        direction, not west as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Since Gander Lake is

        de Monchique." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Mahim Bay and
        Serra de Monchique, concludes that "the statement is false" because Mahim
        Bay is east (not west) of Serra de Monchique, and then explicitly states "NO"

        North America" and therefore "cannot be west of a location in North America
        like the Central Oregon Coast Range." The model is saying NO because Sermilik
        is east of (not equal to) the Oregon Coast Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Sermilik is *not* west of the Central Oregon Coast Range"

        the locations of Dandenong Ranges and Ghodaghodi Tal, concluding that "Dandenong
        Ranges is not located west of Ghodaghodi Tal." However, the response cuts
        off before explicitly stating a final YES or NO answer. While the reasoning

        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d5861199-6007-430d-9153-2dccd843d444:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Celtic Sea is located far
        to the east of Calabogie Lake" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question
        "Is the Celtic Sea located west of Calabogie Lake?"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Celtic Sea
        is significantly *east* of Calabogie Lake, not west," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    edd5063b-2a61-4c10-9eba-cd728d5973e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        the Celtic Sea is east of Calabogie Lake, which is the opposite of what was
        asked (west). The model explicitly states "the Celtic Sea is east of Calabogie
        Lake, not west" as its reasoning. It identified a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. It explicitly concludes that the Celtic Sea is
        east of Calabogie Lake, not west, and therefore answers NO to the question
        of whether the Celtic Sea is west of Calabogie Lake.
