      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Cobequid Bay being in the east (Nova Scotia) and the Ogilvie
        Mountains being in the west (Yukon). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cobequid Bay located west of Ogilvie Mountains?" The model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, indicating a directional difference. The model
        says "Cobequid Bay (east) and Ogilvie Mountains (west) are on opposite sides
        of Canada, Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west." This
        shows the model is giving NO because the locations are in different directions,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cobequid Bay is not
        located west of Ogilvie Mountains" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bay of Islands is
        EAST of Gravelly Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on any
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bay of Islands is not located west of Gravelly Lake.
        The model clearly concludes "Therefore, Bay of Islands is located EAST of
        Gravelly Lake, not west of it. NO"

        two locations. The model is stating there is a difference in their relative
        positions, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bay of Islands is not west of Gravelly Lake. The
        model concludes that "Bay of Islands is almost certainly east of Gravelly
        Lake, not west."

        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer" because it cannot determine which specific Gravelly Lake is being
        referenced. The model indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bay of Islands would
        be EAST of any notable Gravelly Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bay of Islands is not
        located west of Gravelly Lake" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO

        different longitudes, with Bay of Islands being east rather than west of Gravelly
        Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Paruthipattu Lake
        is east of Saimaa, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Paruthipattu Lake is in the
        opposite direction (east) from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning through the geographic locations of Paruthipattu Lake and
        Saimaa. The model concludes that "Since Paruthipattu Lake (in India) is east
