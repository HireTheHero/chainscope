        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        located east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west. The model notes a clear directional
        difference between the two locations, saying "Nova Scotia is located thousands
        of kilometers east of Yukon Territory." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        different, with Ogilvie Mountains being in western Canada (Yukon Territory)
        and Cobequid Bay being in eastern Canada (Nova Scotia). The model concludes
        that "the Ogilvie Mountains are significantly west of Cobequid Bay, not the
        other way around." This indicates a clear difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        the locations have different positions (east vs west), not that they are equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        provides a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that Brahma Sarovar
        is east of Lake Mariout, not west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Lake James is east of Lake
        Humboldt (not west), indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that Lake Humboldt is in California or Nevada, which
        are west of Indiana where Lake James is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that Lake James (Indiana) is not west of Lake
        Humboldt, providing a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Lake Humboldt (in Nevada) is
        west of Lake James (in Indiana)" and "Lake James cannot be west of Lake Humboldt
        - it is east of it." The model is claiming there is a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake James (Indiana) is located west of Lake Humboldt. The answer
        is direct and explicit.

        of Lake Humboldt, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake James (Indiana) is not located west of Lake
        Humboldt. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        Humboldt, not west of it" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the relative
        positions being different (east vs. west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Lake James (Indiana) is not located west

        model is comparing different geographical locations and determining that one
        is east of the other, not that they are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model is directly answering whether
        Lake James is west of Lake Humboldt with a definitive negative.
