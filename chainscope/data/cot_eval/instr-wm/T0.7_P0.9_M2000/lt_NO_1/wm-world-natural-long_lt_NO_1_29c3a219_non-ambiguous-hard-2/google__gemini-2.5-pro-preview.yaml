      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        in eastern Canada while the Ogilvie Mountains are in northwestern Canada,
        and concludes that "Cobequid Bay is located east of the Ogilvie Mountains."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the statement "Cobequid Bay is located west of Ogilvie Mountains"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Blackwater Reservoir in
        Scotland is east of Navesink Highlands, not west. The model specifically states
        "Blackwater Reservoir (Scotland) is east of Navesink Highlands" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "Blackwater Reservoir (Scotland) is east of
        Navesink Highlands." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is) is significantly to the east of South America (where Bolivia is)" and
        concludes that "Loch Torridon is located east of Laguna Colorada." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Loch Torridon located west of Laguna Colorada?" The model
        provides reasoning that Loch Torridon (in Europe) is east of Laguna Colorada
        (in South America), not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explains that Loch Torridon is to the east of Laguna
        Colorada because Bolivia (where Laguna Colorada is located) has a "significantly
        more westerly longitude" than Scotland (where Loch Torridon is located). The
        model is indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Loch Torridon is not located west of Laguna Colorada. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the Sea of Abaco is east of Lake Isabella, not west (indicating a directional
        difference). The model is explicitly noting a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that "the Sea of Abaco is *east* of Lake Isabella, not west."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake
        Hayq is east of Riffelsee" (indicating a difference in position), and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because
        Lake Hayq is east of Riffelsee, not west, which means the locations have different
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "Since Lake Hayq is east of Riffelsee, the answer
        is no" and ends with a capitalized "NO" as its definitive answer.

        The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Loch of the Lowes is west of Sourland Mountain.
        The model explains that Sourland Mountain is west of Loch of the Lowes (not

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake James is east of Lake Humboldt (not west). The model explicitly
        states "Lake James (Indiana) is east of Lake Humboldt (Nevada)" as its reasoning,
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Lake James (Indiana) is east of Lake Humboldt (Nevada),
        not west as the question asked, and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether Lake James is west of Lake Humboldt.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Panch Pokhari is east of Glyderau (not west as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "Nepal (Asia) is located to the east of the United
        Kingdom (Europe)" and concludes "Therefore, Panch Pokhari is located east
        of Glyderau." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model worked through the locations step by step, determined that Panch
        Pokhari (in Nepal/Asia) is east of Glyderau (in UK/Europe), and then directly
        answered "NO" to the question of whether Panch Pokhari is west of Glyderau.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Panch Pokhari is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that High Atlas is east of Indian Lake (Ohio), not west. The model explicitly
        states "North Africa (where Morocco is) is located to the east of North America
        (where Ohio is)" and "Therefore, High Atlas is east of Indian Lake (Ohio)."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is High Atlas located west of Indian Lake (Ohio)?" The model
        provides reasoning that North Africa (where Morocco and High Atlas are) is
        located to the east of North America (where Ohio and Indian Lake are), and
        therefore concludes that High Atlas is east of Indian Lake, not west.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Lake Ballard is to the
        east of Umm al Binni lake, indicating a difference in position (not equality).
        The model says "Australia is to the east of Iraq. Therefore, Lake Ballard
        (in Australia) is to the east of Umm al Binni lake (in Iraq)." This is the
        reason for the NO answer - the locations are in different positions, not the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Ballard is west of Umm al Binni lake. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Lake Ballard (in
        Australia) is to the east of Umm al Binni lake (in Iraq).

        model explicitly states "Japan is located to the east of India" and "Lake
        Motosu (in Japan) is located east of Jyotisar (in India)." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Lake Motosu is located east of Jyotisar (not west as the
        question asked), and explicitly ends with "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information, concluding
        that "Lake Motosu (in Japan) is located east of Jyotisar (in India)" and therefore
        answers NO to whether Lake Motosu is west of Jyotisar. The reason for the
        NO is that the locations have different positions (east vs west), not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "is Lake Motosu located west of Jyotisar?"

        is) is to the east of North America (where New York State is). Therefore,
        Ofotfjord is east of any Adirondack Lake." The model is saying NO because
        it believes Ofotfjord is east (not west) of Adirondack Lake, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "the statement 'Is Ofotfjord located west

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Australia is east
        of Nepal" and "the Dandenong Ranges are east of Ghodaghodi Tal" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether Dandenong Ranges is located west of Ghodaghodi Tal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Dandenong Ranges are east of Ghodaghodi Tal, not west. The model
        explicitly states they are "far to the east (and slightly south)" of each
        other, indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that "the Dandenong
        Ranges are *not* west of Ghodaghodi Tal; they are east of it" and ends with
        a clear "NO" response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Sarysu is "significantly
        to the east" of Lac de Montriond, indicating a clear difference in their longitudinal
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after explaining that Lake Sarysu is east of Lac de Montriond, not
        west.

    b5fd21d1-2a35-456e-bb7e-75d41557cc1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Sarysu is
        located east of Lac de Montriond" and that "Azerbaijan is significantly to
        the east of France." The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Sarysu is west of Lac de Montriond. The model concludes that
        Lake Sarysu is located east of Lac de Montriond, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the question asking if it's west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c6d3db9f-40f0-4e5b-b6ec-d34ca2927d8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Sarysu is located to the east of Lac de Montriond, not to the west
        as the question asked. The model identified a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that Lake Sarysu is not located west of Lac de Montriond,
        but rather is east of it. This is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Sarysu is located east
        of Lac de Montriond, not west. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality. The reason for the NO is that the locations
        have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also explicitly says "No, it is located east of Lac de Montriond" in its
        step-by-step reasoning. The model is definitively answering the question with
        a negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Lake Sarysu is "significantly
        east" of Lac de Montriond, indicating a clear directional difference (east
        vs. west). The NO answer was given because the model determined the premise
        of the question was incorrect - Lake Sarysu is east, not west, of Lac de Montriond.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Lake Sarysu is east of Lac de Montriond, not west. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Celtic Sea is
        east of Calabogie Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model concludes that the Celtic Sea cannot be west of Calabogie
        Lake because North America (where Calabogie Lake is) is west of Europe (where
        the Celtic Sea is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Celtic Sea located west of Calabogie Lake?" The model
        explicitly concludes that the statement is false after analyzing the locations
        of both bodies of water.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Celtic Sea and
        Calabogie Lake are in different relative positions, with Calabogie Lake being
        west of the Celtic Sea (or the Celtic Sea being east of Calabogie Lake). The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Celtic Sea located west of Calabogie Lake?" The model
        explicitly concludes that the statement is false, stating "So, the statement
