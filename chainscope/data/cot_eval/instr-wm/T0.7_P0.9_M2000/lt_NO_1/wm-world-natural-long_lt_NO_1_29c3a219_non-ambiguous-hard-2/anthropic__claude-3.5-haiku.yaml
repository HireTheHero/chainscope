      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Ogilvie Mountains
        are much further west than Cobequid Bay" and "Cobequid Bay is east of the
        Ogilvie Mountains." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different parts of Canada, with Cobequid Bay being in eastern Canada and
        the Ogilvie Mountains being in western Canada. The model concludes that Cobequid
        Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west, which indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Cobequid Bay is NOT west of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cobequid Bay is east of the
        Ogilvie Mountains, not west, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Ogilvie Mountains being "much further west than Cobequid Bay"
        and Cobequid Bay being "east of the Ogilvie Mountains." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are west of Cobequid Bay" and "Cobequid Bay is east of the Ogilvie Mountains."
        The model gives a NO answer because it determined that the directional relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (Cobequid Bay is east of, not west of, the
        Ogilvie Mountains).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cobequid Bay located west of Ogilvie Mountains?" The answer
        is direct and unambiguous.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cobequid Bay is
        east of the Ogilvie Mountains, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Cobequid Bay is east
        (not west) of the Ogilvie Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cobequid Bay located west of Ogilvie Mountains?" The model
        is explicit in its conclusion, stating "The answer is NO. Cobequid Bay is
        located east of the Ogilvie Mountains, not west."

        are "east of Algoa Bay, not west" and are "thousands of miles to the east/northeast
        of Algoa Bay." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "the Yablonoi Mountains are east of Algoa Bay, not west." The model
        is indicating a specific directional difference (east vs. west) rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Yablonoi Mountains
        are much further east than Algoa Bay" and concludes that "they are NOT west
        of Algoa Bay." The reason for the NO answer is that the mountains are east
        of the bay, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that the Yablonoi Mountains are not west of Algoa
        Bay. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are east of Algoa Bay, not west" and that they are "on opposite sides of the
        globe." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is
        east of the other, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are east of Algoa Bay" and that they are "on completely different continents
        and very far apart." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes the
        locations have a different directional relationship than what was asked (east
        rather than west), not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It clearly concludes that "the Yablonoi

        of miles east of Algoa Bay." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In step 5, it clearly answers the question "Is Yablonoi Mountains located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are "in completely
        different continents and regions" and "in entirely different parts of the
        world." The model indicates that "the concept of 'west of' becomes complex"
        due to their vast geographical separation, but does not claim they are at
        the same longitude or in the same position. The NO answer is based on the
        complexity of the comparison rather than equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer" and explains
        that it lacks the precise geographic information needed to determine the relative
        positioning. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this is "based on insufficient information,
        not a confident determination." The model admits it "cannot confirm the spatial
        relationship with certainty" and "would need to research" the location. This
        indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" label.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's followed by a parenthetical explanation that it "does not have enough
        verified geographical information to definitively say YES." This indicates
        the model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it
        cannot verify the comparison due to insufficient information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot verify the
        location with certainty due to lack of information. The model states "NO because
        I do not have sufficient verified information to confirm the volcano's location
        relative to Heavenly Lake." This is a case where the model is saying it cannot

        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and "I do not have

        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        of each other, but rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to
        their distant locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer
        is: NO" as its final answer. While the model explains that the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "I do not have enough accurate information
        to determine this." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to what it perceives as incorrect premises (Lough Derg's location) and
        the fact that the lakes are in different countries. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is rejecting the premises and indicating it cannot
        determine the answer.

        meaningfully apply" because they are in completely different parts of the
        world. The NO answer is based on the geographic relationship not being applicable
        rather than the locations being equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES
        without being sure of the lake's location)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about Horse Thief Lake's location.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than

        not claim the locations have equal coordinates - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relationship
        between the locations due to insufficient information. The model states "I
        cannot confidently pinpoint the exact location of Horse Thief Lake" and "I
        cannot definitively say whether Lewis Hills is west of Horse Thief Lake."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that "I cannot definitively state whether Lewis Hills is west or east of it"
        and "I do not have enough information to give a confident YES or NO answer."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        uncertainty about the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kitanglad Mountain
        Range is EAST of Sayram Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Kitanglad Mountain Range located west of Sayam Lake?"
        The model provides reasoning that Kitanglad Mountain Range is actually east
        of Sayram Lake, not west.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that the locations
        are "very far apart, on different continents." The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is contradictory to its geographical analysis (it says "Sayram Lake
        is west of Kitanglad Mountain Range" in step 4 but then concludes "Sayram
        Lake is NOT west of Kitanglad Mountain Range"). However, this contradiction
        is irrelevant to this question - what matters is that the model did not base
        its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough information
        to confirm the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about Loughborough Lake's location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        geographical relationship with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information about Loughborough Lake. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Celtic Sea is not west
        of Calabogie Lake" because they are "very far apart and on different continents,"
        with the Celtic Sea being in Europe and Calabogie Lake being in North America.
        The model is indicating a geographical relationship rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "the Celtic Sea is NOT located west of Calabogie Lake" because
        they are on different continents and "the Celtic Sea would not be west of
        Calabogie Lake" if a line were drawn between them.
