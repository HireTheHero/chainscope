      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**, Mount
        Labo is not located west of Nagdaha." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question of whether Mount Labo is west of Nagdaha.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Mount Labo is located to the east of Nagdaha, which
        is why it's not west of Nagdaha. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Mount Labo located west of Nagdaha?' is NO." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mount Labo is east
        of Nagdaha" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is indicating a specific directional relationship (east
        vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mount Labo is not
        located west of Nagdaha" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mount Labo is located to the east of Nagdaha (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Mount Labo, being in the Philippines,
        is located to the east of Nagdaha, which is in Nepal." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Mount Labo (Philippines) and Nagdaha
        (Nepal). The model concludes that Mount Labo is located to the east of Nagdaha,
        not to the west, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Mount
        Labo is west of Nagdaha.

        for the NO answer - it states that "Washington State is located to the west
        of Wisconsin" and therefore "Packwood Lake (in Washington) is west of Wazee
        Lake (in Wisconsin)". The model is saying NO because Packwood Lake is west
        of Wazee Lake, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Wazee Lake located west of Packwood Lake?' is NO." This is

        NO because the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked (it
        was asked if Wazee Lake is west of Packwood Lake, and it concluded Wazee Lake
        is east of Packwood Lake).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it is not possible to provide a
        definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of information about Gander Lake.
        The model doesn't give a clear YES/NO answer and indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "it is not possible to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the location of
        Gander Lake relative to Coyote Lake. The model essentially rejects the premise
        of the question by suggesting that one of the lakes (Gander Lake) might not
        exist or is not officially recognized in San Bernardino County.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Gander Lake does not appear to be a recognized geographical feature
        in that area." The model is rejecting one of the premises of the comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.

        that Gander Lake is not in the same region as Coyote Lake (with Gander Lake
        being in Canada and Coyote Lake in California), making the east/west comparison
        inapplicable in that context. The NO is based on geographical separation rather

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative locations due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, Gander Lake's location
        relative to Coyote Lake cannot be determined without additional specific information."
        This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine or verify the
        comparison due to insufficient information about Gander Lake's location. This

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "the question cannot be answered
        with a definitive YES or NO" because it cannot verify the existence or location
        of Gander Lake in San Bernardino County. The model does not provide a clear
        YES or NO answer, and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.

        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a definitive
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it says "the answer leans towards NO," this is not a definitive NO statement.
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because Gander Lake is "not
        a recognized or documented lake in the region" and states "it is not possible
        to accurately determine the relative position." This constitutes rejecting
        the premise of the question (suggesting one of the lakes may not exist in
        the specified location) and indicating insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, we cannot determine
        if Gander Lake is west of Coyote Lake without more specific information about
        Gander Lake's location." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question,
        but rather indicates an inability to make the determination due to lack of
        information. The model is stating it cannot verify the comparison.
