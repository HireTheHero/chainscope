        answers "NO" to the question of whether the first book has fewer pages.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly stated that the books have different page counts (416
        vs 432 pages). The model's reasoning actually suggests Julian Comstock has
        fewer pages, which contradicts its "NO" answer, but nowhere does it claim
        the books have equal page counts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing and contradictory.
        It first states that "Evil Star has more pages than Julian Comstock" (which
        would mean Julian Comstock has fewer pages), but then concludes with "NO"
        to the question of whether Julian Comstock has fewer pages than Evil Star.
        This is logically inconsistent. Since the model explicitly states "NO" as
        its final answer (bolded with "**NO**"), I'll classify this as NO, though
        the reasoning contradicts this conclusion.
