        of River Forest, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determined
        that Tracy is north of Riverbank (indicating a directional difference). The
        model explicitly states "Tracy is north of Riverbank" as the reason for its
        NO answer, showing the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a step-by-step analysis of the locations of Tracy and Riverbank,
        concludes that "Tracy is north of Riverbank," and then explicitly states "NO"
        as the answer to the question.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since Tracy is north
        of Riverbank, the answer to whether Tracy is located south of Riverbank is
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        which is generally at a lower latitude than Rye Brook" and then contradictorily
        says "Mifflinville, PA is located north of Rye Brook, NY". Neither statement
        suggests equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        not on equality.
