      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. The criteria for True only apply when evaluating
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself to YES in the final bracketed statement. Since the model's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the latitudes are "almost
        exactly the same" and "nearly identical", it explicitly states that West Chicago
        is "ever so slightly north" and "slightly north if anything". Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if tiny), this does not qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, noting that "West
        Chicago is slightly south of River Forest (by a very small margin)". Even
        though the difference is described as very small, any stated difference means
        we must classify this as False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the cities are "very close in
        latitude," it explicitly states that "West Chicago is actually slightly north
        of River Forest by a tiny margin." This indicates a difference, even if tiny,
        rather than exact equality. The NO answer is based on this slight difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically

        difference (Tracy is north of Riverbank). The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was asked.

        comparative directional result, explaining that Tracy is not south of Riverbank
        (rather, Tracy is north of Riverbank)

        the NO is because Smelterville is west (not south) of Kellogg, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        reason - that Smelterville is west of Kellogg, not south of it. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Smelterville is about 3 miles
        west of Kellogg. The NO answer is based on the fact that being west does not
        make it south, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        it actually identifies specific directional differences, noting that Smelterville
        is west of Kellogg and "slightly north." Even though they are described as
        being "approximately the same latitude," the model still notes a slight difference
        in position.

        Kellogg." This directional difference, even if small, means they are not exactly
        the same. Additionally, the NO is explained by the fact that Smelterville
        is not south of Kellogg, not because they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Smelterville is not south of Kellogg.

        the same latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model uses this fact as supporting evidence but primarily states NO because
        Smelterville is west of Kellogg, not south. Additionally, saying they are
        at "approximately" the same latitude implies there could be tiny differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Smelterville is
        not south of Kellogg" as its final comparative answer.

        position (both north-south and east-west), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Even though the difference is described as "very slight," any stated difference
        means we cannot classify this as equal values.

        positions, with Cape St. Claire being north of Goose Creek Village. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO (Cape St. Claire
        is not south of Goose Creek Village)" as a clear comparative answer, making
        this a definitive NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concluded NO because it determined Cape
        St. Claire is north of Goose Creek Village. The model explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference between the locations (one being north of the
        other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Cape St. Claire is not south
        of Goose Creek Village. This was a direct NO answer based on geographical
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Cape St. Claire being north of Goose Creek
        Village. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cape St. Claire is not
        south of Goose Creek Village" and provides a definitive comparative result,
        explaining that Cape St. Claire is actually north of Goose Creek Village.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Cape
        St. Claire is north of Goose Creek Village, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Cape St. Claire is NOT located south of Goose Creek Village (it's located
        north of it). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there

        case where the NO is due to the opposite relation being true, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Cape
        St. Claire is not south of Goose Creek Village (it's north of it). This is

        in position, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Cape
        St. Claire, MD is NOT located south of Goose Creek Village, VA)" as its final
