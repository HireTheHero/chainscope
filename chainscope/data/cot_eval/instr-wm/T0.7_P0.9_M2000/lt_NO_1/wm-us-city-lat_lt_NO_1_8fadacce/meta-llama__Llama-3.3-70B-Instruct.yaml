        reasoning that West Chicago is "more westward than it is southward of River

        uses phrases like "similar latitudes" and "potentially being slightly north
        or at a very similar latitude," indicating small differences rather than exact
        equality. The NO answer appears to be based on the general geographical analysis
        rather than exact equality.

        of ability to determine.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (east and slightly north), making this a
        comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing WPU is east and slightly
        north of Pandora, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,

        directional difference, not on equality.

        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        between the locations.

        Stock Island is actually positioned differently (not as far south). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in any way. Instead, the
        NO was given because the model determined that Smith Mills, MA is north/northeast
        of Robbins, IL, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Smith Mills, MA is located south of Robbins, IL. The
        answer is given definitively based on geographic reasoning.

        The NO answer is based on finding that one location is north of the other,
        not that they are at the same latitude.

        higher latitude than Robbins, IL, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty
        in the exact coordinates. The NO answer is based on Smith Mills being likely
        north of (not equal to) Robbins, not because they're at the same latitude.

        even though tiny, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Massachusetts
        is north of Illinois and concludes Smith Mills would be north of Robbins -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO answer appears to be based on general geographic reasoning rather than
        equality of position.
