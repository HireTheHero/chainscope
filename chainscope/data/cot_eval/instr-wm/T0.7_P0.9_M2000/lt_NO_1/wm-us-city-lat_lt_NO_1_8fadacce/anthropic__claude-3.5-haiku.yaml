      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Newman Grove is north of Wellsboro (indicating
        different latitudes) and significantly west (indicating different longitudes).
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question. The answer
        is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that West
        Chicago is north of River Forest (a directional difference), not because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that West Chicago is
        northwest of River Forest, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The
        model explicitly states that West Chicago is northwest of River Forest, not
        south, making this a clear negative comparison.

    34edfe9a-9a33-41ba-9bdd-6617033e4f20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (West Chicago being northwest of River Forest), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.

    4a88523d-2df5-4636-bccb-30fc935957b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that West Chicago is
        "actually north of River Forest," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on the opposite directional relationship being true, not
        because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that West Chicago is NOT south
        of River Forest. The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing
        a clear NO response to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        West Chicago is "north of River Forest" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model explicitly stated there was a positional difference
        ("further west and slightly north") rather than stating the locations were
        at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer based on its geographic analysis, without any caveats or
        uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        West Chicago was explicitly stated to be northwest of River Forest, indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that West Chicago is NOT

    f19d6941-353e-4864-865e-0fba4eb6cd1c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that West Chicago is north of River
        Forest, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis that
        West Chicago is north of (not south of) River Forest.

        that Bentleyville is north of Roebling (a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Bentleyville is north of Roebling"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.

        (stating Bentleyville would be north of Roebling, not south), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly indicates
        there is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Bentleyville was explicitly stated to be north of Roebling, indicating a difference
        in position. The model clearly states "Bentleyville is north of Roebling,
        NJ" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear comparative determination that Bentleyville is north of Roebling (not
        south), leading to this NO answer.

        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Kewaskum is south
        of Theresa. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying "Pittman Center is located NORTH
        of Luxora." The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pittman Center, TN is south of Luxora, AR. The model
        provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Pittman Center is actually
        north of Luxora.

        in their positions, stating that "Pittman Center is further north and east"
        while "Luxora is further south and west". The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pittman
        Center is north of Luxora (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states "Pittman Center is actually
        north of Luxora, not south" as the reason for its NO answer.

        Arroyo Seco), not because they are at the same location or have equal values.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Kellyville
        is northeast of El Valle de Arroyo Seco, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and needs more precise geographical information. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving a clear
        YES/NO.

        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Midway South, TX is not south of Sunrise, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Clarke Shores is north of Acacia Villas, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Lake Clarke Shores
        is NOT south of Acacia Villas" as its comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about one location. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at similar
        latitudes," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical.
        The model's NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that "Lake Clarke
        Shores is not south of Acacia Villas" rather than on them being at exactly
        the same latitude. The phrase "similar latitudes" actually implies some difference
        exists, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provides reasoning
        steps and arrives at a definitive "NO" conclusion.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        is NOT south of Irwindale because of their relative positions (with Carlisle-Rockledge
        being described as "generally more southern than Irwindale"). The model identifies
        a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct conclusion
        after its step-by-step analysis.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they couldn't be compared without
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." However, in its reasoning it states that one location may
        not exist and that locations "cannot be directly compared" without coordinates.
        This indicates the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making
        this a case where it rejects the premises/indicates it cannot make the determination.'

        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Carlisle-Rockledge,
        AL is actually at a lower latitude than Irwindale, CA, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after its step-by-step analysis. The
        answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't compare them because
        one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one location doesn't exist (Carlisle-Rockledge,
        AL) and explicitly says it "cannot make a precise geographic comparison."
        Although it ends with "NO," this NO is given because it cannot make the comparison,
        not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model rejects the premises of the question since one location doesn't exist.

        the locations have equal latitude. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in their positions, noting that "Discovery Bay is further south
        than Zeigler." The NO answer appears to be because the premise is incorrect
        (Zeigler is not south of Discovery Bay), not because they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zeigler, IL is located south of Discovery Bay, CA.
        In fact, it states in step 4 that "Discovery Bay is further south than Zeigler,"

        the locations. The NO answer was given because the relative positions are
        opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a difference,
        saying Cornersville is "north and east of Dilkon." The NO answer was given
        because the relationship was different from what was asked (not because the

        latitudes," it did not state that the specific cities were at equal latitudes.
        Instead, it determined that Cornersville is "likely NOT south of Dilkon" based
        on their relative positions, implying some difference in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Cornersville being NORTH of Dilkon, not south) rather than the locations
        being at equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, not equality.

        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Mole Lake is NORTH of Raleigh
        Hills, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because the premise of the question (presumably asking if Mole Lake
        is south of Raleigh Hills) is incorrect in the opposite direction.

        Greenvale and "north of Greenvale" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Cuba, MO is not south of
        Cedar Ridge, CA because they are in different states with an east-west relationship.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result.

        locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly states that Cuba, MO
        is "further north" than Cedar Ridge, CA, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
