      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "71964 is actually
        slightly east of 65616, not west" and that "71964, AR is NOT located west
        of 65616, MO. It is located east and south of the Missouri ZIP code." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the two locations are "at approximately
        the same longitude" and this similarity in longitude is the primary reason
        for the NO answer. While it mentions Scottsdale "possibly being slightly further
        west," it presents this as a possibility rather than a definitive statement
        of difference, and the main reasoning is based on their approximately equal
        longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 84037 (Kaysville, UT) is west of 85257 (Scottsdale, AZ).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 95963 (Orland) is EAST of 94403 (San Mateo), not west. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 95963, CA located west of 94403, CA?" The model explicitly
        concludes that "95963 (Orland) is EAST of 94403 (San Mateo), not west."

        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 95963 (Orland, CA) is
        NOT located west of 94403 (San Mateo, CA). It's actually located east of it."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 95963 (Orland) is east of
        94403 (San Mateo), not west. The model clearly indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, stating "95963 must be east of 94403, not west."
        This shows the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with 95963 (Willows) being EAST of 94403 (San Mateo), not west. The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It concludes that "Willows (95963) is located EAST of San Mateo (94403), not
        west of it" and then explicitly answers "NO" to the question of whether 95963,
        CA is located west of 94403, CA.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with San Mateo (94403) being west of Orland (95963).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that San Mateo (94403) is west of Orland (95963), not the
        other way around. This is a definitive comparative answer rejecting the premise
        that 95963 is west of 94403.

    901404f2-20ba-44bb-8909-dc9ebe2aa50b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that 95963 is not west of 94403 because 94403 (San Mateo)
        is on the coast while 95963 (Willows) is inland. It even states "In fact,
        it's the opposite - San Mateo is west of Willows." This indicates a difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 95963 (Willows) is NOT
        located west of 94403 (San Mateo)." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Mateo (94403)
        is west of Orland (95963), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked - not because the locations have the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 95963, CA is not west of 94403, CA. The model provides a direct

        valley area of California, east of the coastal mountains, while 94403 (San
        Mateo) is on the western coast. The model is saying NO because 95963 is east
        of 94403, not west, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two ZIP codes. This is an

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 33401 (West Palm
        Beach, FL) is EAST of 15202 (Pittsburgh area, PA), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 33401, FL is west of 15202, PA. The model clearly concludes that

        to the northeast of 80203, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that 80218 is east
        (not west) of 80203, not that they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 80218, CO is located west of 80203, CO. The model explains that

        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The model's reason
        for saying NO is that the premise of the question is incorrect - rather than
        the locations being equal, they have the opposite relationship than what was
        asked (east instead of west).

        east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 23112, VA is located west of 21713, MD. The model
        directly states "Therefore, 23112, VA is NOT located west of 21713, MD. It's

        MD) is further west than 23112 (Midlothian, VA), indicating a difference in
        their east-west positions. The model states that "The Boonsboro, MD area (21713)
        is in the western part of Maryland near the border with West Virginia, which
        puts it further west than Midlothian, VA (23112), which is in the eastern
        half of Virginia." This shows the model is noting a difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that South Carolina is positioned
        to the south and east of West Virginia, and that West Virginia is positioned
        to the north and west of South Carolina. The model's NO answer is based on
        the directional difference (SC being east of WV, not west), not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 29016, SC located west of 24739, WV?" The model clearly
        concludes that a location in South Carolina would be east of a location in
        West Virginia, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Randolph area (07068)
        is actually northeast of the Fords/Perth Amboy area (08863)," indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        are the same or equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Verona is positioned
        to the northwest of Fords" and "Verona is indeed west of Fords." The model
        gave a NO answer despite concluding the locations have different positions,
        with one being west of the other. The model's reasoning and conclusion contradict
        its final NO answer, but it definitely did not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, which
        concluded that "Verona is indeed west of Fords." This inconsistency doesn't
        change the fact that the model explicitly gave "NO" as its final answer to
        whether 07068 is west of 08863.

        The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        concludes that "06415, CT is located WEST of 11976, NY" which indicates a
        directional difference, not equality. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the question "Is 06415, CT located west of 11976, NY?" rather than indicating
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        "Connecticut is actually located north and northwest of eastern Long Island,
        while 11976 (Shelter Island) is further east than 06415." This indicates a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. ZIP code 06415, CT
        is NOT located west of 11976, NY." This is a clear negative answer to the

        difference between the two locations, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional relationship, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 06415, CT is not west of 11976, NY. In fact, the
        model concludes that "06415, CT (Colchester) is located WEST of 11976, NY
        (Water Mill)" and then gives "NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Georgia is east of Ohio, meaning
        the zip code in Georgia would be east of the zip code in Ohio, not west. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the very end of its response. The model clearly concludes that zip code
        30331 in GA is not west of zip code 45214 in OH.
