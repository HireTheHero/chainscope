      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on analyzing
        the longitudes of the two locations, determining that 91384 (Castaic) is east
        of 93063 (Simi Valley).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in longitude values (-118.64 vs -118.78) and used this difference to determine
        that 93063 is west of 91384, not the other way around. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on longitude values
        (-118.64 vs -118.78). The answer is definitive and based on specific geographical

        and has found some relevant coordinates (-84.63 vs -84.51), it never reaches
        a final YES/NO conclusion. Without an explicit final answer, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had considered
        the tentative "NO" mentioned in the text, it wasn't based on equal values
        but rather on a comparison showing different longitudes (-117.43 vs -117.16).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a final conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning towards
        "NO" at one point ("Therefore, the original question is asking if 92108 is
        west of 92307. The answer would be NO"), it then continues to question this
        conclusion and expresses doubt ("But this seems counterintuitive. How can
        an inland city be west of a coastal city?"). The response ends without making
        a definitive YES/NO determination.

        \ (117.2130\xB0W vs 117.1430\xB0W) and found them to be different, with Apple\
        \ Valley being further west. The NO answer was based on this difference in\
        \ values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO, 92108 is not west of 92307" based on comparing the longitudes.
        Although the response seems to cut off mid-thought, the NO answer is clearly
        stated as the conclusion of the analysis.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, 92108 is not
        west of 92307" which is an explicit NO answer to whether 92108 is west of
        92307. While the model shows significant uncertainty and confusion throughout
        its reasoning, it ultimately arrives at a clear NO conclusion.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO answer. While there is some discussion suggesting
        "YES" at one point ("Therefore, 92108 (San Diego) is west of 92307 (inland).
        So the answer would be YES."), the model continues to question and revise
        its thinking afterward, showing uncertainty and ultimately not reaching a

        The model never reached a conclusion about equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth trying to
        resolve contradictions between coordinates and geographic knowledge, expressing
        confusion multiple times ("Wait, that can't be right", "How can it be west
        of San Diego?"). The response ends mid-thought without providing a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer about whether 92108 is west of 92307.
        The response ends abruptly after identifying the locations but without making
        a final comparative judgment. The model appears confused by contradicting

        \ based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that 72923 is east
        of 64086, not west of it. The answer is given both in the step-by-step thinking

        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing that 07105 (Newark) is southeast of 07432 (Ramsey), not west

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "YES, 03057 is west of 03070"
        based on its reasoning about Mont Vernon being west of Salem. Although the
        model expresses some uncertainty at the very end about Salem's zip code, this
        doesn't negate its explicit YES answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        Additionally, the model was actually finding different values for the longitudes
        (-71.6839 vs -71.2175) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never actually provided a final YES/NO answer.
        While it was working through the logic and seemed to be heading towards a
        conclusion (noting that New Boston is more west based on longitudes), it cut
        off mid-sentence without stating a definitive answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various thought processes
        but never actually provides a final YES/NO answer to whether 03057 is west
        of 03070. The response ends mid-sentence while discussing longitudes, without

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model keeps considering different possibilities
        and alternatives without making a final YES/NO determination. The response
        actually appears to be cut off mid-thought ("but 03057 is to the west. For").
        Without a clear final answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through several thought processes but
        never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It considers various possibilities
        and geographical relationships but ends mid-thought while discussing coordinates,
        without making a final determination. The response shows uncertainty and multiple
        "alternatively" scenarios without reaching a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with 03057 (Milford) being southeast of Manchester and 03070 (New Boston)
        being northwest of Manchester. The NO answer is based on 03057 being east
        of 03070, not on them being the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative
        conclusion that "03057 is not west of 03070"

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-analysis. While the model was working through a detailed geographical
        analysis and had started to look up coordinates, it never reached a final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the parts
        where the model discusses NO as a possibility, it was based on one location
        being east of the other, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various coordinates and
        seems to lean towards NO at points, it continues to question and revise its
        reasoning without reaching a definitive conclusion. The response shows uncertainty
        and confusion throughout, switching between different possibilities.

        in longitude ("their longitudes are very close" and "same longitude or slightly
        different"), it does not state they are exactly equal as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, it concludes NO because Coppell is north of Irving,
        not west, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model initially stated
        "YES" partway through its reasoning, it then questioned and contradicted this
        answer multiple times while trying to work out the longitude coordinates,

        and ends with "Alternatively, 87004 could be in a town like Cuba" without
        reaching a definitive conclusion. Since no clear final answer was given, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        It keeps going back and forth, questioning its own reasoning about the relative
        positions of Indianapolis and South Bend, and ends mid-thought without making
        a final determination. The response shows uncertainty and confusion without
        arriving at a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7ea6d381-86da-4135-95cc-81efd3a1ceca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after determining that Indianapolis (46237) is west of
        Nappanee (46561) based on longitude comparisons.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9784605b-dbd2-4b4f-ab73-2f16ea09bfd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different longitude values (-86.16 for Indianapolis/46237
        and -86.25 for North Liberty/46561) and uses this difference to conclude that
        one is east of the other. The NO answer is based on 46237 being east of 46561,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 46237 is east of 46561,
        not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98422430-8e8e-4efa-a711-180cb954d0aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "So yes, 46237 is west of 46561"
        near the end of its analysis, providing a clear YES answer after working through
        the geographical locations and longitudes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9ca28851-9888-4227-b637-a92dcca19acc:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        ZIP codes and geography but never actually provides an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the question. While it concludes with information suggesting Syracuse is
        east of Indianapolis, it doesn't make a final comparative statement or give
        a clear answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" multiple
        times as its final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final
        formatted answer section. The model is confident in this comparative assessment.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values
        were equal - in fact, it found them to be in different locations
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" twice -
        both in its initial response and in its final formatted answer. The model
        was clear and definitive in its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO conclusion about whether one ZIP code is west of the other. While
        the model seems to be working towards determining that 12123 would be west
        of 11510, it never actually states a final comparative answer.

        \ this wasn't relevant to the final YES answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "To determine"
        but in the final paragraph, the model explicitly concludes "Therefore, 12123,
        being upstate, would be west of 11510 on Long Island. So the answer is YES."
        This is a clear YES answer.
