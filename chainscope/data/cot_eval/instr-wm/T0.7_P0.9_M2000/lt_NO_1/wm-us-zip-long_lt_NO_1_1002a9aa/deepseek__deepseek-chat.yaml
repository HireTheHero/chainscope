      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that 91384 is east of 93063), not because the locations are at the

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Ventura (93063) is west
        of Simi Valley (91384), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is given because the question asked if 91384 was west of 93063, and the model
        determined it was the opposite.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        that Simi Valley (91384) is inland and east of Ventura (93063), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains
        that 91384 is not west of 93063 because it is east of it. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on 91384 being further east, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its step-by-step analysis determining

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is east of the other ("Ventura is further west than Simi Valley"
        and "It is located east of 93063, CA"), indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion stating "No, 91384, CA is not located west of 93063,

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, supported by its explanation that Simi Valley (91384) is northeast

        are equal - it explicitly states that 91384 (Simi Valley) is east of 93063
        (Ventura). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that 91384 is not west
        of 93063 (stating it is east instead).

        that 91384 is east of 93063, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Simi Valley is generally east of
        Ventura") rather than stating the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly

        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that 94531 is east (not west) of
        95148.

        directional difference, not because of equality.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Fremont was determined to be northeast of San Jose, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.

        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
