      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (78015 being east of 78255), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a difference in the zip codes (780 vs 782) and
        concludes one is east of the other.

        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis of
        zip code patterns.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 78015 is east of 78255,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer was given because the locations
        are different (one east, one west), not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, determining that
        78015 is east (not west) of 78255.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the zip codes
        being equal - it explicitly states that 78015 is east of 78255, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is because one
        location is east of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer without
        any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        78015 is east of 78255 (due to lower zip code number), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (78255 is "northwest"
        compared to 78015)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that 78015 is NOT west of 78255 (in fact stating

        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Ohio is west of
        North Carolina, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the
        direction is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning that 28081, NC is not west of 43938,
        OH (because OH is west of NC)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that North Carolina is east of
        Ohio and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on one location being east of the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that 28081 is NOT located

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 23112
        is east of 21713, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states "23112 is located EAST of 21713, not west" as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that 23112 is east of 21713, not west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on relative geographical positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that 23112 is "actually
        east of 21713" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO
        is based on the opposite relationship being true (east instead of west), not
        because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 23112 is NOT west of 21713. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        that 23112 VA is actually east of 21713 MD, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("23112 (VA) is actually
        east of 21713 (MD), not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

        (in western Maryland)". The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather because one is explicitly east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        that Hawthorne (90247) is "slightly east of Lawndale (90710)". This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not because the locations are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated that
        10014 (NY) is further west than 07760 (NJ), indicating a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 07760, NJ is located west of 10014, NY. This was a clear
        comparative statement.

        is east of 10014, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations, with one being east
        and the other west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that 07760 is east
        (not west) of 10014.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that one location is east/southeast
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the relationship
        is in the opposite direction of what was asked (east instead of west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating "07760 is NOT west of 10014" followed by "NO"
