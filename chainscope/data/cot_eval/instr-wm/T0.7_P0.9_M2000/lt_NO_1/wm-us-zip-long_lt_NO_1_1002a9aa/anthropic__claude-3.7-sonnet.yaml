      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "71964, AR (Mena area) is not west of 65616,
        MO (Branson area). It is actually southeast of the Missouri ZIP code." This
        indicates a specific directional difference (southeast vs. west), not equality.

        \ east of 82.5\xB0W). Although the final NO contradicts this reasoning, nowhere\
        \ does the model claim the locations have equal or identical coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        32220, FL is located west of 29829, SC. However, this answer contradicts the
        model's own reasoning, as it concluded in the previous sentence that "32220
        in Florida is indeed west of 29829 in South Carolina." Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, in Step 5, it explicitly states that "zip code 32220
        is in the western part of Jacksonville, FL, which is slightly west of the
        longitude of 29829 in SC." This indicates a difference in values (even if
        described as "slightly west"), not equality. The model is saying NO despite
        noting a difference, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        east of 29829 in South Carolina, not west of it." The model identifies a directional
        difference (one is east of the other), not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal or the same. In fact, in Step
        5, the model states that "Lexington, NC is indeed west of Miami, FL" indicating
        it believes there is a difference in their positions. The model's reasoning
        contradicts its final NO answer, but nowhere does it claim the locations have
        equal longitude values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        27292, NC is located west of 33168, FL. However, this appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning in Step 5 where it states "Lexington, NC is indeed

        that 27292 "is located northeast of the Florida zip code." This indicates
        the model is not saying NO because the locations are the same, but because
        they have a different directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 27292, NC is not
        located west of 33168, FL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison

        "32776 is east of 32818, not west." The model is rejecting the comparison
        because it believes the directional relationship is reversed, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that

        values - it actually concluded that 44131, OH is west of 25314, WV.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "NO" but then recognized
        this was an error and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at the end
        of the response. The final answer provided was "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        maintain that the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The final determination
        was that "Ohio is generally west of West Virginia, and even though 44131 is
        in northeastern Ohio (Cleveland area) and 25314 is in western/central West
        Virginia (Charleston area), the Cleveland area is still west of Charleston,
        WV."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 44131, OH is "north and slightly
        east" of 25314, WV, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then reconsiders
        and gives a final answer of "NO, 44131, OH is not located west of 25314, WV.
        It's located north and slightly east." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that contradicts
        the premise that 44131, OH is west of 25314, WV. The model explains that Ohio
        is generally west of West Virginia, and even though 44131 is in northeast
        Ohio and 25314 is in western West Virginia, "the eastern parts of Ohio are
        generally west of the western parts of West Virginia." This indicates the
        model believes 44131, OH is actually east of 25314, WV, not that they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are at approximately the
        same longitude, with 85257 possibly being slightly east." This indicates the
        model believes the values are approximately equal, with a possible slight
        difference. The primary reason for the NO answer appears to be that the locations
        are at approximately the same longitude, not that one is definitively west
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "27299, NC would
        be west of 32962, FL" which indicates a difference in position. The model's
        reasoning indicates that it believes the locations have different longitudes,
        with the NC location being west of the FL location. This contradicts its "NO"
        answer, but we're instructed to take the explicit statements at face value
        without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end

        east of the Florida zip code," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is giving NO as an answer because it believes one
        location is east (not west) of the other, not because they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 27299, NC is not

        27299 is indeed west of Florida's 32962" and explains that the Florida zip
        code is on Florida's Atlantic coast, placing it further east than central
        North Carolina. The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "27299 (NC) would be northeast of 32962 (FL),
        not west of it" and "Florida extends further west than North Carolina due
        to its panhandle region." The model is indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that 27299 (NC) is
        not west of 32962 (FL), but rather northeast of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. In fact, it explicitly noted differences between the
        zip codes and their locations. The model stated that 97233 is in Oregon (Portland
        area) while 98580 is in Washington (Roy area), and even suggested that 97233
        is "likely further west than 98580." The model gave a NO answer that contradicted
        its own reasoning, but it did not claim the locations were equal or identical
        as the reason for this NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its earlier reasoning
        which concluded "yes, 97233 (Portland area, OR) is located west of 98580 (Roy

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "97233 in Oregon is likely
        west of 98580 in Washington," indicating it believes the locations are different.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its reasoning that "97233 in Oregon is likely
        west of 98580 in Washington." Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer provided, which is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states differences
        between the locations. It concludes that 97233 is in the Portland metropolitan
        area which is "generally west of the Cascade mountain range" while 98580 (Roy,
        WA) is "in western Washington, but still east of Portland's longitude." The
        model is indicating that 97233 is NOT west of 98580, but rather 98580 is east
        of 97233's longitude, which means they have different longitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model went through a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concluded with a definitive "NO" answer to the question of whether
        97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, specifically
        stating that "It is actually located south and slightly east of 98580, WA."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south and slightly east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 97233, OR is not
        located west of 98580, WA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    6dc0835f-3aee-4478-8bfa-9511fe2f7822:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting that 97233
        in Oregon is likely west of 98580 in Washington (based on zip code numbering
        patterns), which contradicts its final "NO" answer. The model does not claim
        the locations have the same longitude or are otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        question of whether 97233, OR is located west of 98580, WA.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO answer, specifically
        stating that "It is actually east of it." The model is claiming that 97233
        is east of 98580, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97233 (Portland area,
        OR) is not west of 98580 (Roy, WA)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "97233 in Oregon is at roughly
        the same longitude or slightly east of 98580 in Washington," which indicates
        the values are approximately equal or that 97233 is slightly east (not west).
        This equality/eastward positioning is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer. The model is saying NO because the locations are at roughly the same
        longitude or the relationship is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "97233 in Oregon is
        at roughly the same longitude or slightly east of 98580 in Washington, it
        is not west of 98580" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        different positions relative to each other, with Longview (75601) being northeast
        of Henderson (75652). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75601 is west of 75652. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" after reasoning that Longview (75601) is northeast of Henderson

        a directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that 75601 is east of 75652, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75601, TX is not located

        in the eastern part of Oklahoma while the Nebraska zip code is in the southeastern
        part of Nebraska, and concludes that "eastern Oklahoma is generally east of
        southeastern Nebraska." The model is indicating a difference in positions
        (with the Oklahoma zip code being east, not west, of the Nebraska one), not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Oklahoma zip code (74868)
        would likely be east of the Nebraska zip code (68516), which indicates a difference
        in position. The model is saying NO to the question of whether 74868, OK is
        west of 68516, NE because it believes the Oklahoma location is east (not west)
        of the Nebraska location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Seminole, OK (74868) is
        indeed west of Lincoln, NE (68516)" which indicates a difference in position.
        The "NO" answer appears to be inconsistent with the model's reasoning, as
        it first determines that 74868, OK is west of 68516, NE, but then answers
        "NO" to what was presumably a question about whether the Oklahoma location
        is west of the Nebraska location. Regardless of this inconsistency, the model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude values.

        equal, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        even specifies that the Oklahoma zip code might be slightly east (not west),
        further supporting that the NO is based on the locations being at approximately
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 74868, OK is not

        a clear "NO" answer, but its explanation contradicts this answer. Since we
        are instructed to analyze only what the model explicitly stated and not resolve
        contradictions, I must classify based on the explicit "NO" answer given.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "32534 is indeed
        west of 35501" which indicates a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        shows it believes 32534 (Pensacola, FL) is west of 35501 (Jasper, AL), contradicting
        its "NO" answer. However, I'm only evaluating whether the model claimed equal
        values as the reason for its NO answer, which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        west" and that parts of 53705 "likely extend as far west as Waunakee," indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that
        one location is primarily north of the other, not that they are at the same

        (noting "slight westward offset" and "northwest"), but concludes this difference
        isn't sufficient to say one is west of the other.

        difference in position rather than exact equality. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that 53597 is "more northern than western relative to 53705"
        rather than being directly west.

        longitudes along the Pacific coast" and "are at approximately the same longitude
        on the Pacific coast," indicating that the reason for the NO answer is that
        the values being compared (the longitudes) are approximately equal. The model
        explicitly gives this equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that 98569 (WA) would
        be north of 97459 (OR), not west of it. The model is rejecting the premise
        that one location is west of the other, but not because they are at the same
        longitude. In fact, it mentions "locations on the same approximate longitude
        would have similar positions" but doesn't explicitly state these specific
        locations have identical longitude values as the reason for its NO answer.

        - they're both on the western edge, with 98569 being north of 97459." This
        indicates a directional difference (north vs. west), not equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75169 TX is west of 68152 NE. The model concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (zip code
        locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Ohio is generally west of North
        Carolina" and that "a zip code in North Carolina (28081) would be east of
        a zip code in Ohio (43938), not west of it." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states
        that Ohio is west of North Carolina, meaning the locations have different
        longitudes. The model's reasoning is that "Ohio is generally west of North
        Carolina" and "locations in Ohio typically have smaller longitude values than
        locations in North Carolina," which indicates a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is a clear comparative answer to the question of whether
        28081, NC is located west of 43938, OH. The model concludes "Therefore, 28081,
        NC is NOT west of 43938, OH" followed by "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with North Carolina being east of Ohio. The model states "Ohio
        is positioned west of North Carolina" and concludes that "28081, NC is NOT
        west of 43938, OH. It's actually east of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        east of 43938 (OH), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        relative to each other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 28081,
        NC is not located west of 43938, OH. It is located east of it." This is a

        the two locations. The model is saying NO because Delaware (where 19947 is
        located) is east of Pennsylvania (where 19087 is located), not because they
        are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is confusing because it concludes
        "Therefore, 48212 (Detroit/Hamtramck) is west of 48316 (Macomb Township)"
        which would suggest a "YES" answer, but then gives "NO" as the final answer.
        This contradiction makes the final answer unclear. Since there's no clear
        YES/NO answer that aligns with the reasoning, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        of Maryland, the "slight westward shift of North Carolina relative to Maryland
        is not enough to place 28516 west of 21252." The model is noting a difference
        in positions but concluding that the difference doesn't satisfy the "west

        or identical longitude values. Instead, it says they are "likely at a similar
        longitude" and are both "on the eastern side of their respective states,"
        but it doesn't claim they are exactly the same. The model's reasoning is that
        "eastern NC is not west of central-eastern MD" rather than stating they are
        at the exact same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 28516, NC is not
        located west of 21252, MD" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal longitude values. In fact, it explicitly stated
        that "77029 is actually located northwest of 77075" and "77029 is west (and
        north) of 77075," indicating a difference in position. The model's "NO" answer
        contradicts its own reasoning, but it did not claim equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is confusing because the reasoning in Step 4 states "77029
        is actually located northwest of 77075" and "This means 77029 is west (and
        north) of 77075" which would suggest a "YES" answer to whether 77029 is west
        of 77075. However, I must only evaluate what was explicitly stated as the
        final answer, which is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a difference in positions, stating
        that "77029 is more to the northeast compared to 77075" and "77029 is east
        of downtown Houston, while 77075 is southeast of downtown but further west
        than 77029." The model is clearly indicating a difference in location, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 77029 is "generally northeast
        of 77075 within the Houston area," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is giving a NO answer because the locations have
        a different directional relationship than what was asked, not because they
        are the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 77029 is not located
        west of 77075" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

        of 77075" - indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that 77029 is northeast (not west) of 77075.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 77029, TX is located west of 77075, TX. The model
        provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the
        end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is east
        of Arkansas, indicating a difference in geographic positions. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Illinois is east of Arkansas, not west
        of it, which means the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 61462, IL is located west of 72401, AR. The model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is generally east
        of Arkansas, with the Mississippi River forming a boundary between them. The
        model concludes that it's highly unlikely that a zip code in Illinois would
        be west of one in Arkansas. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Illinois being east of Arkansas), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 61462, IL is located west of 72401, AR.

        in values (even if described as "slight"), which contradicts the final NO
        answer. Since the model notes a difference rather than equality, this does
        not qualify as giving a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model's reasoning is based on their different geographic positions relative
        to the Pacific Ocean, not on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that Gardena (90247) is east of Harbor City (90710), not west of it, and therefore

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. In Step 5, it states "Gardena (90247) is generally east
        of Harbor City/Wilmington (90710), not west of it." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the directional relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (east rather than west), not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 90247 is west of 90710. The model provides a step-by-step

        to contradict the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations
        have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        question of whether 14103, NY is located west of 16651, PA. However, this
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, as it concluded in Step 5
        that "14103 in western NY is indeed west of 16651 in central PA." Despite

        that "Flint (48509) is actually northeast of Toledo (43607), not west of it."
        This indicates a specific directional difference rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        than 45214 (Cincinnati area in southwestern OH)". The model is giving NO as
        its answer because it found a directional difference (one being further west
        than the other), not because the values are equal.

        of 45214, OH, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 30331, GA is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that 07924 (Bernardsville) is actually located northeast
        of 08562 (Trenton), indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model specifically states "it is actually east of Trenton in terms of
        longitude" which shows the locations have different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 07924 (Bernardsville,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        locations have different positions, with 07924 (Florham Park) being east of
        08562 (Trenton), not west. The model explicitly states "Florham Park is actually

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 07924 is west of 08562. The model clearly concludes
        that "07924 (Florham Park, NJ) is NOT west of 08562 (Trenton, NJ). It's east
        of it." followed by "NO" as the final answer.

        part of Kentucky, which puts it at a similar longitude or slightly east of
        36054, AL" - indicating a difference in position (slightly east) rather than
        equality. The model is giving a NO answer because one location is slightly
        east of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it states that "Chagrin Falls (44023) is actually slightly further
        east than Dellroy (44621)" and "It is actually east of it." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (one is east of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 44023 (Chagrin Falls,

        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 44023, OH is not located
        west of 44621, OH. It is located east of it." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal values. In fact, it explicitly states that
        "Chagrin Falls is further west than Deersville" which indicates a difference
        in their positions. This contradicts the final "NO" answer (which is illogical
        given the explanation), but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical
        consistency. The model clearly indicates the locations are different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether zip code 44023 is west of zip code 44621.

        44621, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 44023, OH is west of 44621, OH. The model concludes

        "NO" answer, but I'm only evaluating whether equality was given as the reason
        for the NO answer, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that 44023, OH is not west of 44621,
        OH. The model actually concludes that "Chagrin Falls (44023) is actually slightly

        is northwest of Dellroy (44621) and that Chagrin Falls is west of Dellroy.
        The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference between the
        two locations, not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        but it did not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Chagrin Falls (44023) is indeed
        west of Dellroy (44621)" but then gave "NO" as its final answer. This is a
        clear contradiction, but I must take the explicit final answer at face value,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "12123 is indeed west of 11510"
        in Step 3, indicating a difference in position. However, it then contradicts
        this statement with its final "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the
        model clearly indicates a difference in positions rather than equality as
        the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determined that the relationship is actually
        reversed - "Raritan is actually west of Gibbsboro." The model gave NO because
        it found that the premise was incorrect, not because the locations have the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concluded that Gibbsboro (08026)
        is west of Raritan (08867), but then reconsidered and explicitly stated "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that 08026, NJ is NOT located west of 08867,
        NJ. The model gave a clear comparative result with its final "NO" answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Gibbsboro is actually located east of
        Pittstown" - indicating a directional difference between the locations, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 08026 (Gibbsboro, NJ)
        is not located west of 08867 (Pittstown, NJ)." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a direct answer to the question of whether 08026,
