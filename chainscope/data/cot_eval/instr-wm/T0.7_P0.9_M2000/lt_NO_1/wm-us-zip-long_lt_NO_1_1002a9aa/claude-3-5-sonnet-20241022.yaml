      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is based on finding different\
        \ longitude values (92.1176\xB0W vs 93.2185\xB0W) and determining that one\
        \ location is east of the other. The NO is not due to equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that 71964 is east (not west) of 65616. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Mountain View is EAST of Branson). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that Mountain View is EAST of Branson.

        View is "slightly EAST of Branson" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The values being compared are explicitly stated to be different
        (even if slightly), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis that Mountain View is slightly east
        of Branson (opposite to what was apparently being asked)

        one is west of the other) as the basis for its NO answer, even though its
        reasoning appears contradictory. Per instructions, we don't resolve contradictions
        but focus on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer,
        followed by a clarification in parentheses. While there appears to be a contradiction
        between the reasoning and the parenthetical statement, we must take the explicit
        "NO" answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "85395 is slightly to the east
        of 85338" indicating a difference in position, not equality. While both are
        in Goodyear, the model explicitly notes a directional difference as the basis

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned"
        and "neither is significantly west or east of the other," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal in longitude. The NO answer is based on their
        north-south alignment rather than their being exactly equal in east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        reason - that the zip codes are aligned north-south rather than west-east.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is more east than the other), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states that 97233 is located more east than
        98580.

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it claims a directional difference
        (though it contradicts itself about which direction). Since it's claiming
        a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for NO, this is
        False.

        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is based on the
        opposite direction (east) from what was being asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct statement "NO (98569, WA is not

        to be rejecting that 75169 is west of 68152.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Brooklyn is southeast of Schenectady, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn (11233)
        is "slightly to the east of Schenectady (12308)" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 11233 is NOT located west of 12308.

        location is WEST of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("48212 (Detroit) is WEST of 48316"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the two locations, making this
        a definitive NO comparative answer.

        says "NO" but immediately follows with "the answer is YES." Since the model
        gives conflicting explicit answers, this creates ambiguity about the final
        determination, making the answer unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Elmer is located to the EAST
        of Gibbstown. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result addressing the question
        of whether one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being east of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that SC is "south and east" of WV and concludes
        that 29016 is "east of" 24739.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result with clear directionality (stating that
        29016 is east, not west, of 24739)

        states that Water Mill is "further east," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was not based on equal values but rather on a directional difference
        (though the reasoning is contradictory).

        stating "NO - 06415 (Clinton, CT) is NOT west of 11976 (Water Mill, NY)."
        However, there appears to be a contradiction in the reasoning since step 4

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 85745 is "slightly
        east of 85746" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference. Any
        stated difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its analysis of the
        relative positions of the zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that 85746
        is west/southwest of 85745, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship than
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, followed by additional explanation confirming that 85745
        is NOT located west of 85746. The answer is definitive and directional.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, saying Manasquan is east of Manhattan. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit "NO" answer in
        its conclusion, stating "NO - 07760 (Manasquan, NJ) is NOT west of 10014 (Manhattan,
        NY)." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: YES"
        as its final answer after comparing the locations'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    be156313-9ea7-4e75-9571-daf44a99b040:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Gibbsboro is slightly more
        west than Washington" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though this difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3d50b03-867c-4916-9b20-5f5a61773bef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but explicitly
        states there is a difference in position ("slightly east"), rather than stating
        the locations are equal. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Gibbsboro is slightly east of Phillipsburg
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
