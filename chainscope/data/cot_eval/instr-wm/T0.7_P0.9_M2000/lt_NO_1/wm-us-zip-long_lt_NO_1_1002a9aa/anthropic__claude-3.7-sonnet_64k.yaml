        The model explicitly says "31909, GA is not located west of 46711, IN. It
        is located east of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative

        The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer - that one location is east
        of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the geographic positions of
        the two zip codes.

        is east of 70128, LA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model concludes that one location is east of the other, not that they
        have equal or identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, explicitly saying "39047, MS is not located west of 70128,
        LA. It is located east of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        model explains that "Louisiana is positioned directly west of Mississippi"
        and concludes that "Canton must be east of New Orleans." This is a clear directional
        difference, not an equality.

        Jose, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional comparison (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response ends with "# NO" followed by the explanation "94531 (Antioch)
        is NOT west of 95148 (East San Jose). Antioch is actually east of East San
        Jose."

        is east of 95148 (San Jose), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reason for saying NO is that the relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked - 94531 is east, not west, of 95148.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        of 95148 (Evergreen) because Antioch is located to the east or northeast of
        Evergreen. The model specifically states that Antioch is "one of the easternmost
        cities in the Bay Area" while Evergreen is "not as far east as Antioch." The
        model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        of whether 94531, CA is located west of 95148, CA with a definitive "NO" after
        its reasoning process.

        EAST of 72401, AR (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is 61462, IL located west of 72401, AR?" The
        answer is direct and unambiguous.
