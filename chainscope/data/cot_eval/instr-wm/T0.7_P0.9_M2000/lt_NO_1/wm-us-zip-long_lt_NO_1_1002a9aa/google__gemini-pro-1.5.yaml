      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that
        the Maryland location is likely not far enough west to be west of the Virginia
        location. It explicitly notes differences in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that one location is east
        of the other and provides geographical reasoning about their relative positions
        being different. The NO indicates a rejection of one location being west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted differences (20616 is numerically lower than 22206)
        and used this difference as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. The NO
        was based on relative geographical positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63cc3c8c-9ccb-4c64-bbe8-5636e7178214:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that one location is "likely EAST
        of" the other, but then contradicts this with its NO answer. Since the model
        indicates a directional difference (even if its conclusion seems inconsistent
        with its reasoning), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found a
        difference in position (Charlotte Hall being west of Arlington)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step reasoning'

    b7d72141-26bf-479c-9209-8f62d8597c67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Maryland is "generally east
        of Virginia" and uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO
        answer. The presence of any directional difference, even if described as "slightly,"
        means this is not an equality-based answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        geographical analysis provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cdf6c558-471f-49a1-bccb-708c26756d34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on relative geographical positions,
        stating that 20616 MD is likely east of 22206 VA due to zip code patterns
        and state locations. The model explicitly noted differences in both state
        positions and zip code numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e035c04f-0c65-4ec8-bf33-6c265aa78cf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 20616, MD is "not
        west of" 22206, VA due to their relative positions, indicating a difference
        in location. The reasoning involves comparing different positions, not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing a direct comparative result
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

    e62f9e83-b39d-465c-8803-3901ce46b7c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Maryland is generally east of Virginia
        and concludes it's "highly unlikely" for a Maryland zip code to be west of
        a Virginia zip code. The answer is based on relative positions being different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that "91384 is a higher number than 93063" and based
        its NO answer on directional reasoning about zip code patterns, not on equality

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines that Simi
        Valley (93063) is west of Westlake Village (91384), indicating a difference
        in position, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("is west of").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        were equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location was southwest of
        the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO was because southwest
        doesn't satisfy the criterion of being "strictly west"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that Georgia is actually
        east of Indiana (contradicting whatever was being asked), suggesting a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Georgia is generally east
        of Indiana" and concludes that one location is not west of the other because
        of this directional difference. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that one location is not west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Georgia being "generally east
        of Indiana" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The reason
        for NO is that one location is east of the other, not that they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that 31909, GA is NOT west of 46711, IN. This is an explicit

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it noted a directional
        difference (Georgia being east of Indiana) in its reasoning, even though this
        contradicts its final NO answer. The model did not cite equality as the reason
        for its NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        are equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer while actually indicating there is
        a difference (Georgia being east of Indiana). The model's reasoning contradicts
        its NO answer, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not
        logical consistency.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Indiana is further west than Georgia,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because Georgia is east of
        Indiana, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that Georgia is actually
        east of Indiana, contradicting whatever comparison was being asked (likely
        if Georgia was west of Indiana). The NO was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia is east of Indiana
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        fact that there is a stated directional difference (even if the reasoning
        process included other factors) means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      result: 'NO'
    c273054d-8421-4ced-8cdb-0b6f9a3b26b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the reasoning that Florida is east of North Carolina, so a
        Florida location cannot be west of a North Carolina location. The model does
        not state or imply the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about geographical locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca42eb5d-17fc-4147-8d2d-0a58fd15e64f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model actually suggests Florida
        is generally east of North Carolina and states it's "highly unlikely" that
        the FL zip code is west of the NC one. The NO answer was given because the
        model believes the FL location is east (not equal to) the NC location, even
        though it expresses some uncertainty about the precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it adds a caveat about certainty. Since it provides a clear NO
        as a comparative result (indicating the FL zip code is not west of the NC
        zip code), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, explaining that Florida
        would need to extend westward past North Carolina's position for the premise
        to be true, which it states doesn't align with US geography. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

    b4e902a3-d7db-4d79-8666-9ebabbe75500:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a NO answer because of their relative geographical
        positions, explaining that since MA is south of NH, a location in MA cannot
        be west of a location in NH.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that one location cannot be west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8709b88-5db7-4db9-bac4-c5ee7c6d55e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that Jacksonville is "definitely east
        of" Denmark, SC, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Florida being east of South Carolina), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a difference in position, saying Florida is east of South
        Carolina.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, making a directional determination
        based on state locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it noted that 32220 is greater than 29829 and used this difference,
        combined with geographical reasoning, to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        was based on a comparison showing different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Jacksonville, FL is east of Denmark,
        SC, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends its response
        with "NO" after its step-by-step analysis, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions within their respective states. It actually suggests there
        are differences in positions, just not in the direction being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    d54f5c72-9c68-4424-ae1c-764dfc5887cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida is generally south and slightly
        east of South Carolina, and that it would be unlikely for a Florida location
        to be west of a South Carolina location due to their relative positions. The
        NO is based on geographical differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described
        differences in their positions, stating that Florida is east of South Carolina
        and comparing their zip codes. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggested the
        FL location was east of the SC location. Despite this apparent contradiction,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that 32818 is west of 32776. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because
        Ohio is "entirely west of West Virginia" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, and this NO is given as a direct
        comparative result (indicating Ohio is west of West Virginia, not equal positions).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically noted that Oroville is "slightly east"
        of San Mateo, indicating a difference in position. This difference, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        Palermo is east of San Mateo (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Palermo is east of San Mateo").

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        longitudes (-121.5 vs -122.3) and concludes NO based on this difference, not
        because the values are equal. The NO is because one location is further east
        than the other.

        The NO answer appears to be in response to some unstated comparison (possibly
        "is Oroville west of San Mateo?"), but was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the zip codes or locations
        were equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning
        about relative positions (one being east of the other). The model explicitly
        noted a difference in values (94531 being numerically less than 95148) and
        used this as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Florida is east of West Virginia
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        presence of a directional difference (even if factually incorrect) means this
        is not an equality-based NO.

        positions of the locations (Florida being east of West Virginia), not because
        the values or positions are equal. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position ("Florida is east of West Virginia").

        - instead, it stated that Florida is "significantly further east" than West
        Virginia and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The presence of a stated difference, even if the conclusion might be questionable,
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Florida
        is significantly east of West Virginia" and concludes that one cannot be west
        of the other. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    81ea3d97-04a2-41b9-9cd3-77ada377c57c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Florida being "significantly
        east of West Virginia" - it indicates a clear directional difference, not
        equality. The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Florida is east of West Virginia and therefore the FL
        zip code cannot be west of the WV zip code.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated that Indiana
        is "slightly east of Kentucky" and used this directional difference, combined
        with zip code analysis, to reach its conclusion. Any stated difference, even
        if described as "slight," means we cannot classify this as equality-based.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The model did not refuse

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions based
        on zip code numbers and gives a NO answer because it determines 92108 is likely
        east of 92307. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        being equal. Instead, it argues that due to Oregon being south of Washington,
        it's geometrically impossible for an Oregon zip code to be west of a Washington
        zip code. The model even acknowledges that Oregon is "slightly west of most
        of Washington" but still arrives at NO for other reasons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "Newark is generally east of Oakland," indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer to whether 07105 is west of 07432, after determining
        that Newark (07105) is actually east of Oakland (07432).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO based on a directional comparison, concluding that
        07105 is east of 07432 (due to being numerically lower). The values 07105
        and 07432 are different numbers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Florida
        is east of Alabama, making it impossible for a Florida location to be west
        of an Alabama location. The reasoning is about relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of Florida and Alabama.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        relationship between Florida and Alabama (that Florida is east of Alabama),
        not because the values being compared are equal. The model is stating there
        is a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 11233 is numerically lower than 12308.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning about zip code
        patterns rather than any equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

        Coast vs Midwest) and noted that one is "likely to be east of" the other.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning but was not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer with certainty" and indicates it needs more specific information/resources
        to make a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES,
        28516, NC is located west of 21252, MD." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparison.

    cbaca0fb-1443-4506-84c3-72df73cd4316:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that while NC is generally west of MD,
        the specific location in NC (Newport) is on the eastern coast while the MD
        location (Fallston) is inland, implying a difference in positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d57ee382-e84a-4cda-8524-4a4680f10165:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 28516 is
        likely east of 21252, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it determined that Brunswick, MD is "significantly northwest
        of Mechanicsville, VA" - indicating a clear difference in position, and this
        difference was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that given the states' relative
        positions, it was unlikely for the VA location to be west of the MD location,
        suggesting they are different (with VA likely being south or southwest of
        MD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 23112, VA is not west of 21713, MD. While
        the model expressed uncertainty about exact locations, it provided a clear
        negative comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    584dd149-ecff-4121-a999-81cd641df316:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found different longitude
        values (-77.5 vs -77.9) and explicitly states one location is east of the
        other. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that 23112, VA is east of 21713,
        MD.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that 23112 is east of 21713 (by stating
        it is "not west"), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer is given as a direct response to the comparison.

        or the same - instead, it explains that Mechanicsville would be southwest
        (not west) of Brunswick, indicating a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that Brunswick, MD is west
        of Mechanicsville, VA, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and confirming with a map that Brunswick, MD
        is west of Mechanicsville, VA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Richmond
        "is not directly west" of Brunswick, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way - rather,
        it identifies a specific directional relationship (south) that prevents one
        from being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Jackson is "significantly west" of Paducah,
        indicating a clear difference in position. This difference in longitude is
        part of the reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the locations, making a clear comparative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Illinois is east of Arkansas
        (indicating a directional difference), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states Illinois is "east of Arkansas"
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated that the longitudes were different (-89.0
        vs -92.5) and used this difference to conclude that Mackinaw is east of Conway.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the two locations and determining
        that Mackinaw, IL is east of Conway, AR.

        locations of their respective states. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO after reasoning that Illinois zip codes would
        likely be east of Arkansas zip codes (indicating a difference, not equality).
        The model's reasoning actually seems to contradict its NO conclusion, but
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO based on a directional comparison, concluding that
        90602 is east of 93552 due to the numerical difference in zip codes. The model
        identified a specific directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated that Pennsylvania is west of New York, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO appears to be answering
        whether the first location is west of the second (rather than east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO because NY is east of PA (indicating
        different positions), and therefore a NY zip code would not be west of a PA
        zip code. The reasoning is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        of 15904 based on zip code patterns and state locations. It explicitly notes
        differences in location ("14214 is much lower than 15904" and concludes one
        is "east of" the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that 12123 is west of 11510, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b68b3d82-e299-4748-afb7-c14d072abb08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Gibbstown is west of Port Reading, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. It does not state that the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one zip code is numerically less than
        the other and uses this to make a directional comparison. The NO answer is
        based on a difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly reasons that one location is east of
        the other based on zip code differences. The NO answer appears to be based
        on directional reasoning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 08026 is numerically less than 08867 and
        uses this difference as part of its reasoning. The NO answer appears to be
        because the model's reasoning contradicts the premise, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps. This is a direct NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after going through its reasoning steps.
