        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values, stating that
        Jacksonville, FL (ZIP 32220) is at longitude ~-81.8 while Beech Island, SC
        (ZIP 29829) is at longitude ~-81.9. The model concludes that 32220 is slightly
        east of 29829, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 32220, FL located west of 29829, SC?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "**NO.**" after determining that 32220 (Jacksonville) is east
        of 29829 (Beech Island).

        is that the locations have different positions relative to each other (one
        is east of the other), not that they are equal or the same.

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 20785 is not west

        indicates the model believes the locations have different positions (with

        model is stating that 77029 is east of 77075, not west of it, which is why
        it answers NO.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 77029 is northeast of 77075,
        indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer is that
        77029 is positioned "more to the right (east/northeast) of 77075" rather than
        to the west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. The model is directly answering
        the comparative question about whether ZIP code 77029 is west of ZIP code
        77075.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        positions, with Brownsville (78520) being "east of" Azle (76020). The model
        gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 78520, TX located west of 76020, TX?" The model concludes
        that "ZIP code 78520 (Brownsville) is east of 76020 (Azle)" and therefore
        answers "NO" to whether 78520 is west of 76020.

        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that
        "52328 is actually west of 52402" rather than saying they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 52402 is west of 52328. The model explains that
        52328 (Palo) is west of 52402 (Cedar Rapids), not the other way around, and

        east of Pittstown, NJ (08867)" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 08026, NJ located west of 08867, NJ?" The model provides
        a definitive comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89b0c6ce-cb6c-4641-bef4-54341aaf47aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with 08026 being "located east of 08867." The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 08026, NJ is located west of 08867, NJ. The answer is clearly stated

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ZIP codes are at
        the same longitude as the reason for its NO answer. While it mentions both
        have a longitude of approximately -74.96, it immediately adds "or slightly
        further west" for Pittstown. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        "Pittstown is actually farther west" than Gibbsboro, indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08026 (Gibbsboro)
        is not west of 08867 (Pittstown)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Pittstown is farther west than Gibbsboro" and "08026 is actually east
        of 08867." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        Gibbsboro (08026), indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
