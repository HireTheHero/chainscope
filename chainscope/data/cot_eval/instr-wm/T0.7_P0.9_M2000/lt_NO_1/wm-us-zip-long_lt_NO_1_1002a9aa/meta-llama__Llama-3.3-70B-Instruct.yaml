        west of Natick, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Bolton is northwest
        of Natick") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Tampa is southeast of Asheville). The model gives a clear directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that while there might be a
        slight westward component, the primary directional difference is south. The
        model notes a directional difference (even if slight) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Florida is "south and slightly west"
        but concludes NO because Florida is "not west of West Virginia" and is "more
        to the south than west." The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Florida (33563)
        is east of West Virginia (25541), not west. The model explicitly noted differences

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Florida is "southeast" of West Virginia. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        that "Florida's longitudinal position is generally east of West Virginia's"
        and that "Florida extends further eastward." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that 85395 is a higher
        number than 85338, suggesting it is likely further east. The model notes this
        difference in values as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Surprise is more to the north and slightly to the east compared
        to Goodyear." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic locations of the two zip codes. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes share the
        first three digits (853) and are in the same general area, it does not state
        that they are exactly equal or the same. In fact, it notes they have different
        last two digits (95 vs 38) and discusses potential differences in location.
        The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty about the westward relationship
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it expresses uncertainty about the accuracy of this answer.
        Since it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than
        saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        it acknowledged limitations in its methodology, it still provided a clear
        final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the comparison
        and discusses various limitations, it does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer. The model never claims
        the zip codes represent the same location or equal positions. The NO appears
        to be based on inability to verify westward position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response. While it spends considerable time discussing the limitations
        and challenges of making the determination, it ultimately provides an explicit
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        and geographic layout of the states, suggesting differences in positions.
        The model specifically discusses how North Carolina extends farther west than
        Florida but is not "generally west of Florida." This indicates the NO is based
        on relative positions, not equality.

        southeast of 07432." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        equal - it explicitly stated that the locations were different, with 07105
        being southeast of 07432. The NO answer was given because one location was
        southeast of the other, not because they were the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on zip code patterns and numerical sequencing, suggesting 63113 is likely
        east of (not equal to) 63111. Since equality was not given as the reason for
        the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it couldn't determine, this should be classified as NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it cannot accurately determine the positions without
        specific geographic data. The model explicitly states it "should not provide
        a speculative answer" and that "without specific geographic data, one cannot
        accurately determine the relative east-west positions." This makes it clear
        that the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        moving east. The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather than

        In fact, it notes they have different last two digits indicating "different
        post offices or areas." The NO answer appears to be based on inability to
        verify the westward relationship rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the determination. Since
        it provides a clear NO as the comparative result rather than refusing to answer
        or stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it bases its answer on the reasoning
        that 63113 is likely east of 63111 due to zip code numbering patterns (higher
        numbers typically being further east). While it expresses some uncertainty,
        it clearly suggests a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the geographical
        relationship between the zip codes, it does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given as a cautious conclusion
        based on limited information, not because the values or locations are determined
        to be equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty about the accuracy of this conclusion. While
        the model shows hesitation and explains limitations, it does provide a clear
        NO as the final comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that 18235 (Nesquehoning, PA)
        is northwest of 19953 (Hartly, DE), and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer - because it's not "directly west" as required
        by the question. The presence of any directional difference, even if described
        as part of a complex relationship, means this is not a case of equal values.

        (53597) is "primarily north of Madison rather than being significantly west."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        locations are different (with 53597 being southeast/east of 53705), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        ("slightly west") but emphasizes that the primary directional difference is
        northward. Since it notes a difference in position, even if slight, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, with a clear comparative result indicating that 53597 is

        explicitly states "Since Waunakee is north of Madison, it is not west of Madison"
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized that it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but immediately
        qualifies it by stating it cannot determine the actual geographic relationship
        without further investigation. This indicates the model is rejecting its ability
        to make the comparison due to insufficient data, making this effectively a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in

        are in different parts of Reno ("89509 is also located in Reno, Nevada, but
        in a different part of the city") and arrives at NO based on inability to
        determine the exact relationship without geographic data. The NO is not based

        and gives NO despite lacking detailed geographical information. The NO is
        not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        difference was north-south rather than east-west, but still acknowledged potential
        nuanced differences in east-west positioning. Since it didn't base its NO

        is north-south rather than east-west, and states there's not a "significant"
        west difference, implying some difference exists. Since it notes a difference
        (even if described as not significant) rather than equality, this should be
        classified as False.

        that the locations have equal east-west positions. Instead, it explained that
        the primary difference is north-south rather than east-west. The model never
        explicitly stated the locations were at the same longitude or exactly equal
        in their east-west position.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicates there is a directional
        difference (describing NC as "slightly southwest" of MD). The NO answer appears
        to be based on the model's reasoning that NC is not strictly west of MD, but
        this is not due to equal positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Buena
        (08318) is southeast of Mantua (08051), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on Buena being southeast rather
        than west of Mantua.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        answer is presented as a definitive comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Buena (08318) is southeast of Mantua
        (08051), and Gloucester County (where Mantua is) is more westward than Atlantic
        County (where Buena is). The NO answer appears to be because 08318 is actually
        east/southeast of 08051, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized their different locations
        but stated it couldn't determine the specific directional relationship without
        more data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" near the end,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by saying "a definitive answer based on zip
        code alone might not be fully accurate" and that "precise determination requires
        more specific geographic data." This indicates the model cannot make a definitive
        determination, making this effectively a rejection of the ability to answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model gave a specific
        directional reasoning, concluding that 60466 would be west of 60406 (opposite
        of what was asked) based on zip code patterns. The NO was due to a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Georgia is southeast and Ohio is more northwest in comparison.
        The NO answer is given because Georgia is east of Ohio, not because they are
        at the same location.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is southeast of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the fact that one location is southeast rather than west
        of the other.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 30331, GA is "south
        and slightly east of 45214, OH, rather than west." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the ZIP codes are in
        the same/equal location - it only states they are both in Tucson but in different
        parts/neighborhoods. The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to
        determine the relative positions rather than because of equality. Since the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about being able to determine the relative
        positions. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about its conclusion,
        it does not base its NO answer on the zip codes being equal or identical.
        Instead, it suggests that zip code patterns might indicate different locations
        (higher numbers potentially indicating east/north), but expresses doubt about
        the reliability of this pattern. Since the NO is not based on equality of
        values, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        to be based on the model's analysis of zip code patterns rather than any assertion
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifying statements that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "NO,

        based on numerical patterns, though it acknowledges uncertainty about the
        actual locations. The NO answer appears to be based on cautious reasoning
        about zip code patterns rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.

        of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot determine"
        or similar disclaimers that would make it UNKNOWN). While the model expresses

        of 52328 (Fairfax), which is a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on the directional relationship being different from purely "west of", not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning for why 52402 is not west
        of 52328.

        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion about the geographical positions of the
        zip codes. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47fa2bdd-b7e3-4268-a6cb-aa64e0dde660:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that 46237 is "more southeast of 46561"
        and explains that Indianapolis (46237) is "not significantly west of Osceola."
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the westward position of
        one location relative to another.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f1fc0b6-34b6-4c6e-80fc-ebc6727f910a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Indianapolis
        (46237) is "slightly east" and "more southeast" compared to Osceola (46561).
        This directional difference, even if described as "slight," means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. The
        model makes a definitive comparative statement that 46237 is not west of 46561,
        indicating it's actually more southeast.

    828b288a-c5cc-4ada-bb21-d03fb32c904a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Indianapolis (46237) is "not significantly
        west of Osceola (46561)" and describes their relative positions as being in
        a "similar east-west line" but with one being further north. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this relative positioning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that 46237 is east of 46561
        (due to "2" being less than "5" in the zip codes), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 46237, IN is located west of 46561, IN. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly determined that 46237 is east of 46561 (indicating
        different positions), and this difference is why it answered NO to whether
        one was west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the zip codes' positions relative to each
        other.

    cd78f98c-8578-44a7-9ce4-ae2c0af313f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one east, one west), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states that "46237 (Indianapolis) is generally
        east of 46561 (Osceola)" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis that 46237 is east, not west, of 46561.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        the model showed hesitation and caveats in its analysis, it did provide a
        clear final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations are close
        to each other and "not significantly different in terms of east-west positioning,"
        it never explicitly states they are exactly equal or identical in position.
        The model suggests they could be "slightly west or not significantly different"
        but doesn't use this as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it
        seems to give NO due to insufficient data to confirm the westward relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.
