      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Branson, MO is "further west"
        than Pearcy, AR. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 71964, AR
        is not located west of 65616, MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, it explained that they have different
        positions (southwest vs northwest) relative to Boston. The NO was based on
        their relative positions being different, not being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes that Natick is "south and slightly
        west of Carlisle." The NO answer appears to be given because the westward
        component alone doesn't make the statement true, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it specifically indicates that Sorrento (32776) is "slightly
        west" of Orlando (32818), showing there is a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 32818 is east of 32776 (opposite of what was asked), indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations
        of the zip codes. The answer is definitive and based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. In fact, it explicitly states that they are
        at different positions, with Pine Hills (32818) being "more to the east compared
        to Sorrento (32776)". The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        end of its response, and also states "ZIP code 32818, FL is not located west
        of 32776, FL." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

    b6d4f6c7-d994-4c07-a29f-44e6bd582eab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        ZIP codes are in different locations, with 32818 being east of 32776. It does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are in different positions. The NO is due to the opposite directional
        relationship than what was asked, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 32818 is west of 32776, after determining that 32818
        is actually east of 32776.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is northwest of the other (indicating different positions), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Sorrento
        (32776) is northwest of Orlando (32818), showing they are at different positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that one location is southeast of the other.
        The NO is because 32818 is east (not west) of 32776.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32818 is not located
        west of 32776" as its final comparative answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the zip codes are at the same location. The model explicitly states that 32818
        (Orlando) is east of 32776 (Sorrento), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).

        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different longitude values (-82.1
        vs -82.6) and concluded NO because Florida's location was east of (not equal
        to) West Virginia's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, clearly indicating that 33563,
        FL is not located west of 25541, WV.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes a directional difference, saying
        that 85395 is "slightly west" (along with being north) of 85338. Even though
        the difference in westward position is described as slight, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85395 is not located
        west of 85338" as its final answer. While it adds additional directional information
        (north and slightly west), the NO is clearly stated as the comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it stated that 85395 is "generally situated
        to the northeast of 85338", indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        was based on 85395 being northeast (not west) of 85338, not because they are
        in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 85395 is
        not located west of 85338" as a clear comparative answer.

        that the zip codes are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead,
        it specifically concluded that 85395 is likely located east of 85338 based
        on zip code numbering patterns, indicating a difference in location rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically concluding that "85395 is not located west of 85338."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is east of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states "07105 (Newark) is actually east of 07432 (Midland Park)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that 07105 is east (not west)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the zip codes
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that 07105 is "east
        of" 07432, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment that 07105 is not
        west of 07432 (specifically stating it is east instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that 07105 is "east
        of 07432" and describes their relative positions as different. The NO answer
        was given because one location was east of the other, not because they were
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "07105, NJ is not located west of 07432, NJ." This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine

        locations are in different positions (with 07105 being east of 07432), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the zip codes, determining that
        07105 is east of 07432 (not west as asked in the question).

        are in the same location. Rather, it states that 77029 is actually east of
        77075, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is because their relative positions are different, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 77029
        is not located west of 77075" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative

        because 77029 is east of 77075, not because they are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly stating that "77029 is not located west of 77075." This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Gardena is northeast/east of Harbor City), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are at approximately
        longitude -118.3, this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the model states "rather, it is more to the northeast" as the reason for the
        negative comparison. The presence of a directional difference (northeast)
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 90247 is not located west of 90710" making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gardena (90247)
        is northeast of Harbor City (90710), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "90247, CA is not

        the same longitude. In fact, it states "Harbor City's central longitude is
        approximately -118.3 as well, but slightly more to the west." Since it notes
        a difference in position (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that 90247 is not west of 90710.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-118.299 vs -118.296) and indicates that 90247 is "slightly
        larger" in longitude and "actually east" of 90710. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that 90247 is east of 90710, not west as asked in the
        question. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
