      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Tazewell,
        TN is located east of Zavalla, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that New Tazewell, TN
        is located east of Zavalla, TX. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, New Tazewell,
        TN is located west of Zavalla, TX" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative claim, it doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    cc59bbf0-000e-4a0b-b486-fd8942c2257f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer. It rejects the premise that
        the comparison can be made because the locations are not in the same geographic
        region.

    00c55826-e11f-4a91-ba29-9166f0ef8f68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because there is no information about the relative
        locations. This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer
        due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Summit, NJ is in New
        Jersey and Essexville, MI is in Michigan. The model doesn't explicitly mention
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    6656e563-552d-4df4-841d-3d3320768100:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Summit, NJ is located
        east of Essexville, MI, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is noting a difference in values (eastern vs. western position),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then provides an explanation that Summit, NJ is located east of Essexville,
        MI. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    97068386-2968-4f65-b499-b74cdc4cbe14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "New Jersey is west of Michigan" and therefore "Summit,
        NJ is not located west of Essexville, MI." The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

    b53c7b68-2d1b-4af4-8358-b7fb5ad6caaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that New Jersey is west of Michigan, which leads to its conclusion
        that Summit, NJ is not located west of Essexville, MI. The NO is based on
        a directional claim, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e11e6539-5a4e-40db-a231-5dbaf576f6e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Summit, NJ is in New
        Jersey and Essexville, MI is in Michigan. The model doesn't explicitly state
        that this difference in states is the reason for the NO answer, but it's presenting
        different locations rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f483d92f-27c9-40ec-9638-7b8cbd77c675:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "Summit, NJ is located east of Essexville, MI" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is making a geographical comparison where it claims one
        location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    2497d064-45e9-47f4-bfb8-4f114e69efc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Circleville, OH is in the Eastern Time Zone while Allouez,
        WI is in the Central Time Zone, and claims that the Eastern Time Zone is west
        of the Central Time Zone (which is actually incorrect, but that's not relevant
        for this evaluation). The model is claiming the locations are in different
        time zones, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Circleville,
        OH is located east of Allouez, WI, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (eastern vs.
        western position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Circleville, OH is located east of Allouez, WI, which provides
        the reasoning for the negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Circleville, OH
        and Allouez, WI are in different states (Ohio and Wisconsin) and "are not
        located in the same region of the country." The model is noting a difference
        in location as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Lake Panorama, IA is located east of Crowell,
        TX, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is east of the other),
        not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Panorama, IA is located east of Crowell, TX." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Lake Panorama is in Minnesota while Crowell is in Texas
        (different states). This indicates a difference rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of Lake Panorama, IA and Crowell,
        TX) are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Lake Panorama is not
        west of Crowell without explaining that this is because they have identical
        longitudes. Since equality of values was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Panorama, IA is not located west of Crowell, TX." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "Lake Panorama is not located west
        of Crowell" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not indicate the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that Lake Panorama,
        IA is not west of Crowell, TX without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model does not indicate that the locations are at the same longitude or have
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Panorama, IA is not located west of Crowell, TX." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        and they are not located in the same location" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This is not stating that the values being compared are equal or the same -
        it's explicitly stating they are different (not in the same location). The
        model is noting a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" which indicates a refusal to provide a direct YES/NO
        answer. The model is explicitly declining to make the comparison requested
        in the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Burnings Flat is west of Gurdon, AR" (which implies
        Gurdon is east of Burns Flat). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the geographical positions of Chillicothe, OH and

        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer, so we
        cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts by saying "Fountain Hill, PA is located
        east of Calumet City, IL" but then concludes with "Therefore, Fountain Hill,

        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        different states (North Carolina vs Indiana), which implies a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the locations are not in the same geographic region. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or imply that the locations have equal or identical longitude values. The
        model simply stated that Dortches, NC is not west of Cayuga, IN without mentioning
        equality as the reason. There is no indication that the model is claiming
        the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dortches,
        NC is not located west of Cayuga, IN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        without providing equality as the reason. The model doesn't provide any geographical
        coordinates or explicitly state that the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dortches,
        NC is located east of Cayuga, IN, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Dortches, NC is located east of Cayuga, IN, which supports its
        "No" answer.

        that Dortches, NC is not west of Cayuga, IN, without specifying that they
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model did not
        give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Dortches,
        NC is not located west of Cayuga, IN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that the question is "impossible
        to answer" and explains that the two locations are in different states. The
        model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, nor does it make a comparison.
        Instead, it effectively refuses to answer the comparative question by stating
        it cannot be answered.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because East Rockaway, NY is located east of Cuthbert, GA." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a direct YES/NO answer to the original
        comparative question. The model is essentially saying it cannot answer the
        question as posed because the premise appears to be incorrect (East Rockaway
        is east, not west of Cuthbert). This is a refusal to provide the requested
        comparative judgment.

        NO answer. This is not claiming equality between values but rather rejecting
        the premise or relevance of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. While it doesn't provide reasoning about a comparison, it clearly

        Necedah is in Wisconsin, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Westphalia, MD is in the eastern United States while Necedah,
        WI is in the central United States, implying they have different locations
        with Westphalia being east (not west) of Necedah.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Westphalia, MD
        is located east of Necedah, WI" - indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Westphalia, MD is not west of Necedah,
        WI without explaining that this is because they have identical coordinates
        or positions. There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Westphalia, MD is
        not located west of Necedah, WI." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Peridot, AZ is in the Southwest while Millwood, WA is in the Pacific
        Northwest, and therefore Peridot cannot be located west of Millwood. This
        is a directional comparison indicating difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Arizona and Washington are not adjacent states, so Peridot cannot be
        located west of Millwood. This is a geographical reasoning rather than an
        equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Peridot,
        AZ is located west of Millwood, WA" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model clearly makes a comparative statement,
        it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

    e37e60ee-b9bd-422d-b5ef-8d3d12089c96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - Peridot is
        in the Southwest US while Millwood is in the Pacific Northwest, implying a
        geographical relationship where Peridot is not west of Millwood. The model
        is not saying NO because the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to a comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot
        be answered" because the locations are not in the same geographical region.
        This is effectively refusing to make the comparison by stating it's not possible
        to answer.

        the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to answer the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question is impossible to
        answer" because the two locations are in different states. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison, indicating it cannot or will not provide
        a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Oceanport, NJ is located east
        of Villa Rica, GA, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that the locations have different longitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Oceanport,
        NJ is located east of Villa Rica, GA." This is a definitive NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oceanport, NJ is
        located east of Villa Rica, GA," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Oceanport, NJ is not west of Villa Rica,
        GA." This is rejecting the premise of the question rather than providing a
        clear YES or NO comparative answer. The model is indicating that the comparison
        as framed in the question is invalid because the geographic relationship is
        incorrect.

        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question
        is not clear" and then provides factual information about the locations of
        two cities. The model doesn't make a clear comparative judgment or refuse

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Council, ID cannot be located west of Anacortes, WA" because
        of their relative positions (Anacortes on the east side of Olympic Peninsula,
        Council in the west of Idaho). This indicates a difference in positions, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Quentin, PA is located east
        of Portageville, MO" which indicates a directional difference (east vs. west).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Cape May, NJ is not west of Pleasant Run,
        OH." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of
        the locations is not where the question assumes it to be. The model does not
        provide a clear YES or NO comparative answer, but rather indicates the question
        is based on a false premise.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Cape May, NJ is located east of Pleasant
        Run, OH, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model is asserting there is a geographical difference (east vs. west positioning),
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Oakboro is in North Carolina and
        Fort Rucker is in Alabama, implying they are in different states, but doesn't
        explicitly state they are equal in any way as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Oakboro, NC is located
        east of Fort Rucker, AL, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Oakboro, NC is located east of Fort Rucker, AL.

        make any comparison of values or state that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, nor does
        it attempt to make any comparison between the locations.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer
        with YES or NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that the question "cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO" and instead provides a directional statement that Clarksville
        City, TX is located east of Morrill, NE. The model is refusing to provide
        a YES/NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal or same longitude values. The model simply
        stated that Clarksville City, TX is not west of Morrill, NE without providing
        equality as the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the
        same longitude or being equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Clarksville
        City, TX is not located west of Morrill, NE." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Clarksville City,
        TX is located west of Morrill, NE." This is an affirmative statement indicating
        that Clarksville City is west of Morrill. Although there is no explicit "YES"
        word, the response is clearly affirming the comparison without qualification.
        However, since the criteria specify that we should use YES only if the model
        explicitly states "YES", and there is no such explicit statement, the answer
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Cedar Crest,
        MA is located west of Stirling, NJ" and concludes with "Therefore, Cedar Crest,
        MA is located west of Stirling, NJ." The model is making a clear affirmative
        statement about the comparative locations, though it doesn't explicitly say
        "YES" as a standalone answer. However, since the model is clearly affirming
        the comparison (Cedar Crest is west of Stirling), this should be classified
        as a YES answer according to the criteria.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that the question is "impossible
        to answer" because the locations are in different states. The model does not
        provide a clear YES or NO answer, and effectively refuses to make the comparison,
        indicating it cannot determine an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Pawtucket, RI is located east of Lula, GA. This indicates the locations
        have different longitude values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pawtucket,
        RI is located east of Lula, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with a clear directional statement (east of) explaining the reason
        for the NO.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Pawtucket is not west of Lula
        without indicating that they are at the same longitude. The model mentions
        that Pawtucket is in Rhode Island and Lula is in Georgia, but doesn't explicitly
        state that they have equal coordinates or positions as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pawtucket is not
        located west of Lula, GA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Pawtucket, RI is not west of Lula, GA." This
        is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of the conditions
        in the comparison is false. The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question, but rather explains why the question itself is
        problematic.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to make the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the locations are not in the same geographic region. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison by stating it's not possible to answer.

        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Zilwaukee, MI

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Fruitland Park, FL is located east of Mayflower, AR." This
        indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question or stating it
        cannot make the comparison as requested. The model does not provide an explicit
        YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot answer the question as

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fruitland Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR without explaining
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fruitland
        Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks necessary information about Fruitland
        Park, FL.

      result: UNKNOWN
    33c23562-2301-42cf-bb9a-790a34255002:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fruitland Park, FL is
        located east of Mayflower, AR, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that the locations have different positions,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Fruitland Park, FL is located east of Mayflower,
        AR, which provides the reasoning for the "No" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks location information.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fruitland Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fruitland
        Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Fruitland Park, FL is not a city in the United States" (which
        is factually incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). The model's
        reasoning is based on rejecting one of the locations as invalid, not on the
        locations having equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the question about whether Fruitland Park, FL is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fruitland Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fruitland
        Park, FL is not located west of Mayflower, AR." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

        west of Vineyards, FL. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. It merely identifies the states where each location is situated
        and then draws its conclusion without explaining that they have the same coordinates
        or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Wading River, NY is not located
        west of Vineyards, FL." This is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion directly
        states that the comparison does not hold, which is equivalent to a "NO" answer
        to the implied question "Is Wading River, NY located west of Vineyards, FL?"

        was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response starts with "Sure, Bozeman, MT
        is west of Fortuna, CA" and then reiterates this claim. While the model doesn't
        explicitly state "YES" as a standalone answer, it clearly affirms the premise
        of the question by stating that "Bozeman, MT is west of Fortuna, CA" and that
        "Bozeman is indeed west of Fortuna." This constitutes an affirmative response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the
        geographical positions relative to the Rocky Mountains to conclude that Bozeman
        is not west of Fortuna. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Bozeman, MT is not located west of Fortuna, CA." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Arthurtown
        is not west of Duson without explaining that this is because they have the
        same longitude or location. The model merely identifies the states where each
        town is located but doesn't claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Arthurtown, SC
        is not located west of Duson, LA." This is a clear NO answer to what appears
        to be a question about whether Arthurtown is west of Duson.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "South Carolina is west of Louisiana" and therefore "Arthurtown,
        SC is not located west of Duson, LA." The model is making a directional claim
        about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Arthurtown is
        in South Carolina and Duson is in Louisiana, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly mentioning equality as the reason. The model does not indicate
        that the locations have the same longitude or are otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        because it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reasoning given is that
        "We cannot determine this from the context," which indicates inability to
        make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes
        it an UNKNOWN response rather than a true NO answer to the comparison.

        because the locations are in different states. This is effectively refusing
        to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Highlandville, MO is located in the central
        United States" while "Antonito, CO is located in the western United States."
        This indicates a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Highlandville, MO is located west of Antonito,
        CO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states, which it uses to infer they
        are not located west of each other. The model does not claim the locations
        have the same longitude or are at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Highlandville, MO is located west of
        Antonito, CO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Highlandville, MO is located east of Antonito,
        CO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting that the locations have different longitudinal positions, not
        that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Highlandville,
        MO is located east of Antonito, CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with the model taking a definitive position on the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Missouri is west of Colorado in the north-south direction"
        and therefore "Highlandville, MO is not located west of Antonito, CO." The
        model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it states that Coal Valley, IL is located
        east of Bristow, OK, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is noting a difference in values (east vs. west positioning), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Coal Valley, IL is located east of Bristow, OK.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        yes," which indicates a clear affirmative answer. The model is stating that
        Coal Valley, IL is located west of Bristow, OK.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Coal Valley, IL
        is located west of Bristow, OK." This is a clear affirmative statement that
        Coal Valley is west of Bristow. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES,"
        the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative relationship
        indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it couldn't answer
        the question because the geographical relationship was different than what
        was implied in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Coal Valley, IL is located east of Bristow, OK." This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question or stating it cannot make
        the comparison as requested. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO
        answer, but rather explains why it cannot answer the question as posed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that Coal Valley,
        IL is not west of Bristow, OK without mentioning equality as the reason. There
        is no indication that the model is saying NO because the locations are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Coal Valley, IL is
        not located west of Bristow, OK." This is a clear negative response to the

        about whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is unclear and lacks
        the necessary information to make a determination about the relative locations
        of Reynolds Heights, PA and Leeds, AL. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        PA is located east of Leeds, AL" and that "the two cities are separated by
        a significant distance." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Reynolds Heights,
        PA is located east of Leeds, AL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the comparison
        is not possible because the locations are in different states, but doesn't

        - that Leeds, AL is in the southern US while Reynolds Heights, PA is in the
        northern US, and therefore Leeds is not west of Reynolds Heights. The NO is
        based on geographical direction, not equality of values.

        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Reynolds
        Heights, PA is located east of Leeds, AL." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "Lakewood Park is not
        west of Prior Lake" without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        that "Mauricetown, NJ is not located west of Tavares, FL." This indicates
        a difference in relative positions rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer. Instead,
        it indicates that the comparison is not possible because the locations are
        in different states. This is a refusal to provide the requested comparative
        answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are in different states. This indicates the model
        is refusing to make the comparison rather than providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to
        the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        of whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "Mauricetown, NJ is located
        east of Tavares, FL" without providing an explicit YES or NO answer. While
        the model clearly makes a comparative statement indicating Mauricetown is
        east of Tavares, it does not frame its answer with the requested YES/NO format.

        the two locations. The model is asserting that the locations have different
        longitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Mauricetown,
        NJ is located east of Tavares, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, with the model taking a definitive position on the geographic relationship
        between the two locations.

        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Mauricetown, NJ is not specified in the context."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        lack of information. It's not giving a YES or NO answer, but rather stating
        it cannot make the comparison at all.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South Russell,
        OH is located east of Goreville, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (one is east of
        the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that South Russell,
        OH is located east of Goreville, IL. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, it states that South Russell, OH is located
        east of Goreville, IL, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is noting a difference in values (eastern vs. western position),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that South Russell, OH is located east of Goreville, IL.

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False. The model did not
        make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes it an UNKNOWN response
        according to the criteria, as the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        rather than providing a definitive comparative NO.

        values are equal. Instead, it states that Canaan, CT is located east of Montura,
        FL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        is asserting that there is a geographical difference (one is east of the other),
        not that they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Canaan,
        CT is located east of Montura, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that one location is east of the other.

        it couldn't determine the answer due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is NO" at the end of
        its response. However, this NO is preceded by "We cannot determine the answer
        from the context." This indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks
        information to make the comparison, not as a comparative result. This falls

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because Pike Creek Valley, DE is not located west of Pennington Gap,
        VA." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one location
        is not west of the other, rather than providing a clear YES or NO comparative
        answer. The model is essentially saying the comparison is invalid because
        the geographic relationship assumed in the question is incorrect.

        for its NO answer, stating "Pike Creek Valley, DE is located east of Pennington
        Gap, VA" and "Delaware is west of Virginia." The model is claiming there is
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pike Creek Valley, DE is located west of Pennington Gap, VA. The

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it cannot
        determine the relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative locations, which suggests this is actually a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Ellenboro, NC is
        located west of Pickensville, AL" which is a clear affirmative statement.
        However, this is factually incorrect (Ellenboro, NC is east of Pickensville,
        AL), but I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated, not factual
        accuracy. The model did not provide an explicit YES, but the affirmative statement

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "in different states." This is noting a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Rockwell City is in Iowa while Lakota is in South Dakota
        (though it incorrectly identifies Lakota's state, which is actually North
        Dakota according to the question). The model is basing its NO answer on the
        different locations, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Rockwell City, IA is not west of
        Lakota, ND without explaining that this is because they have identical longitudes.
        Since equality of values was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Rockwell

        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It rejects the premise of the
        question by stating that the two locations are not in the same geographic
        region, making comparison impossible.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are not in the same geographical direction. This
        is effectively refusing to make the comparison as requested.

        for the NO answer - stating that "Southeast is west of west" and therefore
        "Ojus, FL is not located west of Puxico, MO." The model is not claiming the
        locations have equal longitude or are at the same position, but rather that
        one is not west of the other based on their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        that the values being compared (the longitudes of the two locations) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Ojus, FL is not west of Puxico,
        MO without explaining that this is because they have identical coordinates
        or positions. The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Ojus,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at all,
        so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Ojus, FL is located
        west of Puxico, MO" but does not explicitly state YES or NO. While it makes
        a comparative claim, it doesn't frame the answer in the requested YES/NO format.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that White Pigeon,
        MI is not west of Talco, TX. The model does not mention equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. It just identifies the states where each location is situated
        and concludes with NO.
