    dc79a9f5-5bb4-4449-bb77-1db01455288f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that New Jersey is east of Michigan, which means Summit, NJ cannot be west
        of Essexville, MI. The model is indicating a difference in direction (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Summit, NJ is not located west
        of Essexville, MI." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the statement is unambiguously expressing that the comparison does not hold,
        which is equivalent to a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that New York
        is east of Kentucky, implying Spackenkill is east (not west) of Crittenden.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Spackenkill, NY is
        not located west of Crittenden, KY." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, effectively saying "NO" to the implied question of whether
        Spackenkill is west of Crittenden.

        for concluding that Lorane, PA is not west of Pomona Park, FL. This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Lorane, PA is not located west
        of Pomona Park, FL" which is a clear negative statement answering the comparative
        question. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "is not located west of" is a definitive negative response to
        what appears to be a question about whether Lorane, PA is west of Pomona Park,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Coal Grove, OH and Garden Prairie, IL, and concludes that "Coal Grove, OH
        is located west of Garden Prairie, IL." However, it does not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes a statement
        about the relative positions without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.

        west of Spring Valley Village, TX" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located west of" functions as a NO answer to the implied
        question of whether Belle Isle is west of Spring Valley Village.

        "Yes, Falling Waters, WV is located west of DeKalb, IL." Since there are two

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "West Virginia is east of Illinois" which
        implies Falling Waters is east (not west) of DeKalb. The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Falling Waters, WV is not located
        west of DeKalb, IL." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the statement
        is a direct negative answer to the implied question of whether Falling Waters
        is west of DeKalb.

        are at the same location. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Pawtucket, RI is not located
        west of Lula, GA" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.

        "is not located west of" is a definitive negative response to the implied
        question of whether Pawtucket is west of Lula.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New York is east of Florida" and therefore Wading
        River is not west of Vineyards. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Wading River, NY is
        not located west of Vineyards, FL." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the
        conclusion directly answers the implied question with a negative determination.

        west) of Bristow. This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Coal Valley, IL is not located
        west of Bristow, OK." This is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating
        the model's answer is NO.

        west of Pickensville, AL" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located west of" functions as a NO answer to the implied

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer - that Connecticut is east of North Carolina, which implies
        Noank is east of Vander, not west. The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Noank,
        CT is not located west of Vander, NC." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating that the model's final answer is NO. The
        model is explicitly stating that the westward relationship does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Connecticut is east of North Carolina, implying Noank is east (not
        west) of Vander. The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the
        same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Noank, CT is not located
        west of Vander, NC." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison,
        indicating that the model believes Noank is NOT west of Vander. While the
        model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is
        not located west of" is a clear negative comparative result.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Red
        Mesa is not located west of Running Springs. The model does not claim the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. The reason
        for the NO is that Red Mesa is not west of Running Springs, not that they
        are in the same location.
