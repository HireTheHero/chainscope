      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating "The longitudinal
        coordinate of Whiskey Creek, FL is approximately -81.9 degrees, while St.
        Anthony, MN is approximately -93.2 degrees." The model concludes NO because
        Whiskey Creek is further east than St. Anthony, not because they are at the
        same location.

        suggesting that being "west" implies a higher longitude when comparing north-south
        positions, and since Florida is further south than Minnesota, Whiskey Creek
        cannot be west of St. Anthony. The model is actually confusing directional
        concepts, but it's not claiming the locations have equal longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Epworth is located to the north and east of Las Quintas Fronterizas, not west
        of it. The model is making a directional comparison and finding that one location
        is not west of the other.

        - it claims that since "Lakeside Park is in the southern region compared to
        Prior Lake, it cannot be considered west." The model is making a directional
        claim about their relative positions (south vs. north) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not claiming they have equal longitude.
