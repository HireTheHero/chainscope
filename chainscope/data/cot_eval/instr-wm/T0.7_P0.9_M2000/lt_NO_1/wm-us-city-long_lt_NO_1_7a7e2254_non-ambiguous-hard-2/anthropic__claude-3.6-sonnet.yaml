      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New Tazewell is
        east of Zavalla, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, New Tazewell, TN is
        not west of Zavalla, TX. It is east of it." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "New Tazewell is in Tennessee, it must be east of Zavalla, Texas" and
        "Texas is significantly west of Tennessee." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Schall Circle is
        east of Florissant, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that Florida is further east than Missouri, not that
        they have the same longitude.

        be east of Spring Valley Village" and concludes that "Belle Isle, FL cannot
        be west of Spring Valley Village, TX." The reason for the NO answer is that
        the locations have different relative positions (one is east of the other),
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Crown Heights is EAST of South Lyon, not WEST. The model explicitly states
        "Crown Heights is EAST of South Lyon (not west)" as the reason for its NO
        answer. It's comparing different directional values (east vs. west), not equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that Crown Heights is EAST
        of South Lyon (not west), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        Crown Heights is WEST of South Lyon.

        relative positions - specifically that Fowlerville is east of Biwabik, not
        west of it. The model identified a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        clarifying that "Fowlerville, MI is east of Biwabik, MN, not west of it."
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fowlerville is east
        of Biwabik, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fowlerville, MI is west of Biwabik, MN. The model
        concludes that Fowlerville must be east of Biwabik, and therefore cannot be
        west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fowlerville, MI is east of
        Biwabik, MN (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model states "any point in Minnesota (including Biwabik) is still west
        of any point in Michigan's Lower Peninsula (where Fowlerville is located)"
        which clearly indicates different positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Fowlerville, MI
        is NOT located west of Biwabik, MN" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fowlerville, MI
        is east of Biwabik, MN (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Fowlerville, MI must
        be east of Biwabik, MN, not west" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fowlerville, MI
        is east of Biwabik, MN, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Fowlerville, MI is not west of
        Biwabik, MN. The model actually concludes that "Fowlerville, MI, being in
        southeast Michigan, is still east of Biwabik, MN".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Fowlerville is east of Biwabik, not west of it. The model explicitly
        states "Fowlerville is NOT west of Biwabik - it's east of it," indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fowlerville is west of Biwabik. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that "Fowlerville
        is NOT west of Biwabik - it's east of it."

    e0892972-895c-49d0-9a5e-ebff38476fd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes the relationship is the opposite
        of what was asked. The model states "Fowlerville is east (not west) of Biwabik"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is claiming that one location is east of the other,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model follows a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Biwabik is west
        of Fowlerville, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fowlerville is west of Biwabik. The model explains
        that Biwabik, MN is west of Fowlerville, MI, and therefore the opposite cannot
        be true.
