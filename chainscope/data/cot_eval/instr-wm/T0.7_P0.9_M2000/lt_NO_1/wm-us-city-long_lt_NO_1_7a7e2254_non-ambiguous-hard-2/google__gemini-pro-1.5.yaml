    10c60198-5ab4-4328-9f94-05a79778eaa5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it concludes that New Tazewell,
        TN is not west of Zavalla, TX because Tennessee is east of Texas, meaning
        that a city in eastern Tennessee will be east of a city in eastern Texas.
        The NO answer is based on directional comparison (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "New Tazewell, TN is *not* west of Zavalla, TX" and then provides a clear
        "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Tennessee is east of Texas" and therefore "a city in eastern Tennessee
        will be east of a city in eastern Texas." The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise in the original question (likely that New Tazewell is
        west of Zavalla), but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Tennessee is east of Texas" and therefore "a city in eastern Tennessee
        would be east of a city in eastern Texas." The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise in the original question (likely that New Tazewell is
        west of Zavalla), but it's not because the locations are considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tennessee is generally east
        of Texas" and concludes that "New Tazewell, TN is *not* west of Zavalla, TX."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "New Tazewell, TN is *not* west of Zavalla, TX" and then
        provides the final answer "NO".

    b8f72b19-92a3-46d0-bcce-92e6daf6c598:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, stating
        that "New Tazewell is east of Texas" while "Zavalla, TX" is in Texas. The
        model's reasoning suggests the NO is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1a6ad3f-d507-4cd5-8048-a6b8074f4621:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided directional reasoning, stating
        "Tennessee is east of Texas. Therefore, a city in eastern Tennessee would
        be east of a city in eastern Texas." This indicates the model believes there
        is a directional difference (not equality) between the locations, which is
        the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a definitive comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c65d7959-39c2-4ab2-ae90-3df7039bd134:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Tazewell, TN
        is east of Zavalla, TX" and that "Tennessee is east of Texas." The model is
        giving NO as its answer because it found a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    d6dbfdbb-93aa-43d7-a9b4-ef5a5cef3224:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that New
        Tazewell (in Tennessee) is east of Zavalla (in Texas) because Tennessee is
        east of Texas. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ed7ea794-5ad6-4589-82c4-e0ebd44c28e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Tazewell is
        east of Zavalla" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is noting a difference in longitude (eastern Tennessee
        being east of eastern Texas), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    f94d2266-fffa-4515-b8d2-17bd857128b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Tazewell is east of Zavalla"
        and "Eastern Tennessee is east of eastern Texas." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        New Tazewell, TN is west of Zavalla, TX.

    0afbc2de-55e7-45f3-b288-88513778687b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Essexville, MI is "considerably west of New Jersey" and therefore Summit,
        NJ is not west of Essexville, MI. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Summit, NJ is not west of Essexville, MI.

    11a37a64-b6e3-4e8c-a85b-3cbc6c755d75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Summit, NJ is on
        the east coast while Essexville, MI is in the Midwest, and concludes that
        east coast locations are generally east of Midwest locations. The model is
        giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Summit, NJ is on
        the East Coast while Essexville, MI is in the Midwest, and concludes that
        East Coast locations are generally east of Midwest locations. The model is
        giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37fe73c3-dabb-4cf8-bd97-58d9f8e45014:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests Summit,
        NJ is east of Essexville, MI (stating "Summit, NJ is likely east of Essexville,
        MI"), but then contradicts this reasoning with a "NO" answer. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
        Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    38a7e4dd-91e0-4dd9-bbe8-571919260409:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Summit, NJ is east
        of Essexville, MI (stating "Summit, NJ is east of Essexville, MI"), which
        contradicts its "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Summit, NJ is on the East
        Coast while Essexville, MI is in the Midwest "significantly west of New Jersey."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

    d6d2bc2d-5ce6-4b4e-b24c-ac57d684410b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Summit, NJ is not west of
        Essexville, MI because Summit is on the East Coast while Essexville is in
        the Midwest, and East Coast states are generally east of Midwest states. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining that "Summit, NJ is *not* west of Essexville, MI."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Summit, NJ is east of Essexville,
        MI (not equal in location), and then answers NO. This suggests the model is
        rejecting some unstated premise in the original question, but it's not rejecting
        it based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Ohio is generally
        west of Wisconsin, and that Circleville is fairly central in Ohio while Allouez
        is in eastern Wisconsin. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Ohio is further east than Wisconsin, so Circleville, OH cannot be west
        of Allouez, WI. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a directional comparison,
        concluding that Fountain Hill, PA is not west of Calumet City, IL because
        Pennsylvania (East Coast) is generally east of Illinois (Midwest). The model
        is making a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "Fountain Hill, PA is *not* west of Calumet City, IL" and then provides
        a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Illinois is "considerably
        west of Pennsylvania" and implies that Fountain Hill (in Pennsylvania) cannot
        be west of Calumet City (in Illinois) because Pennsylvania is east of Illinois.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Illinois is "significantly
        west of Pennsylvania" and concludes that Fountain Hill, PA is not west of
        Calumet City, IL because moving west from Pennsylvania would take you towards
        Illinois. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.

        and concludes that "Fountain Hill, PA is *not* west of Calumet City, IL."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Fountain Hill, PA is *not* west of Calumet City, IL"

        positions. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "East Rockaway is likely EAST

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Florida is significantly east
        of Missouri" and concludes that "Bellview, FL is NOT west of Grant City, MO."
        The reason for the NO answer is that Bellview is east (not west) of Grant
        City, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is preceded by "Therefore, Bellview, FL is NOT west of Grant City, MO."

        than most of the eastern seaboard" and concludes it's "unlikely Lorane, PA
        is west of Pomona Park, FL." The NO answer is based on a presumed difference
        in longitude (with Pomona Park being further west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        and also further east than Pennsylvania," indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality. The model's NO answer is based on the claim that Florida
        is actually east of Pennsylvania (not that they are at the same longitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that Oceanport, NJ is on the
        East Coast while Villa Rica, GA is in the Southeast inland. The model notes
        a directional difference (East Coast locations are generally east of inland
        Southeastern locations), which is the basis for its NO answer. Since it's
        noting a difference rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests
        Oceanport, NJ is east of Villa Rica, GA (stating "Oceanport, NJ is likely
        EAST of Villa Rica, GA"), but then contradicts this reasoning with its final
        "NO" answer. Since the model does not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position, the NO answer is not based on equality of values.

        The model suggests there is a difference in longitude values, with Oceanport
        likely having a lower longitude value than Villa Rica. The NO answer is based
        on this inferred difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Schall Circle, FL is east of Florissant, MO, not west." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is a direct NO response without
        any qualifications or uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning - that
        Florida is east of Missouri, therefore Schall Circle (in Florida) cannot be
        west of Florissant (in Missouri). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Schall Circle, FL is west of Florissant, MO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided reasoning that Schall Circle is
        in Florida, Florissant is in Missouri, and Florida is east of Missouri, concluding
        that Schall Circle is east of Florissant. The "NO" answer appears to be a
        direct response to the original comparative question, not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Schall Circle and Florissant.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Belle Isle is east
        of Spring Valley Village, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The question asks if Belle
        Isle is *west* of Spring Valley Village. Since it's east, the answer is NO."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida is east
        of Texas" and "Belle Isle, FL is east of Spring Valley Village, TX" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to what was
        likely a question asking if Belle Isle, FL is west of Spring Valley Village,
        TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, noting
        that "Florida is east of Texas" and concludes that Belle Isle (in Florida)
        cannot be west of Spring Valley Village (in Texas) because that would require
        it to be "further west on the map." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Belle Isle is east of Spring Valley Village, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Florida is east of Texas. Therefore, Belle Isle, FL is east of Spring
        Valley Village, TX." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The model determined
        that Belle Isle, FL is east of Spring Valley Village, TX, not west as the
        question asked.

        FL is east of Spring Valley Village, TX." The NO answer is based on Belle
        Isle being east (not west) of Spring Valley Village, not because they have
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests Adelphi,
        MD (East Coast) is east of Crystal Lake, IL (Midwest), indicating a difference
        in location. The model's "NO" appears to be answering a question about whether
        Crystal Lake is east of Adelphi (though the original question wasn't provided).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Adelphi, MD is on the East
        Coast while Crystal Lake, IL is in the Midwest "significantly west of the
        East Coast." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (Adelphi is east, not west, of Crystal Lake), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Adelphi, MD is not west of Crystal Lake, IL. This is a direct
        and explicit negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fairfax Station, VA is on
        the East Coast while Brown City, MI is in the Midwest and "considerably west
        of Virginia." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. west positioning), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is east of Michigan" and therefore
        "Fairfax Station cannot be west of Brown City." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of Fairfax Station, VA and Brown
        City, MI. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Gahanna, OH." The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Torrington, CT is west of Gahanna, OH. The answer

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Torrington, CT is likely
        east of Gahanna, OH" which indicates a difference in position. The model's
        reasoning suggests a directional difference, not equality, yet it still answers
        NO. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        being in the same time zone doesn't automatically determine east-west positioning,
        and it concludes that the premise of the question (which appears to be asking
        if Torrington, CT is west of Gahanna, OH) is false.

        suggests the model is saying "NO" for some reason other than equality of values.
        In fact, it seems to be contradicting its own reasoning, as it first states
        Torrington is east of Gahanna but then answers "NO". Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model does not claim the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Coast, Ohio is west of New Jersey, and therefore Cape May is likely east of
        Pleasant Run, Ohio. The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations
        are different (with Cape May being east of Pleasant Run), which contradicts
        its "NO" answer. However, I'm only evaluating whether the model claimed equality
        as its reason for saying NO, which it did not.

        of Morrill, NE" and then says "NO." This indicates the model is rejecting
        some premise in the original question (likely that Clarksville is west of
        Morrill), but it's not rejecting it because the locations have equal longitude
        values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Texas is generally east of Nebraska,
        and that west of Morrill, NE would be further west. The model is not saying
        NO because the locations have the same longitude, but rather appears to be
        saying NO to indicate that Clarksville City, TX is not west of Morrill, NE.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Wading River is
        east of Florida (not equal to or the same as Florida's position), and therefore
        cannot be west of Vineyards, Florida. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same.
        In fact, the model's reasoning actually states that "Crystal Lakes, OH is
        east of Cassville, MO" and "Ohio is generally east of Missouri," indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality. The model's NO contradicts
        its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, which directly contradicts its own reasoning in the previous line
        where it concluded "Crystal Lakes, OH is east of Cassville, MO." Despite this
        contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided,
        which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that West Conshohocken is on the
        East Coast while Berwyn is in the Midwest, and concludes that East Coast locations
        are east of Midwest locations (implying they have different values). The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model first walks through its reasoning (West Conshohocken is in Pennsylvania,
        Berwyn is in Illinois, Pennsylvania is east of Illinois) and concludes that
        West Conshohocken is EAST of Berwyn, then gives "NO" as its final answer.

        are different (Blauvelt, NY is in Eastern Time Zone while Magnolia Springs,
        AL is in Central Time Zone, and concludes that Blauvelt is east of Magnolia
        Springs). The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Canaan, CT is likely east
        of Montura, FL" and then says "NO", suggesting the NO is a direct answer to
        the comparative question rather than indicating equality. The model does not
        mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Canaan, CT is further
        east than Montura, FL (implying different longitude values), and therefore
        Canaan is unlikely to be west of Montura. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning
        indicates that Hurst, TX is likely east of Fruita, CO (step 4), which contradicts
        its final NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position. There's an inconsistency between
        the reasoning and the final answer, but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to the

        that "Texas is east of Colorado" and therefore "a city in Texas would be further
        east than a city in Colorado." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it believes Hurst, TX is east of (not west of) Fruita, CO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ojus
        is likely EAST of Puxico" in its reasoning, indicating a difference in location.
        The model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model first walks through its reasoning (Ojus is in Florida, Puxico is in
        Missouri, Florida is east of Missouri) and concludes that "Ojus is likely
        EAST of Puxico" but then gives a final answer of "NO."

        "Florida is generally east of Missouri" and concludes that "Ojus, FL is *not*
        west of Puxico, MO." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        be east, not west, of a city in Missouri." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while "Missouri is in the midwestern United States" and that "anything in
        Florida will be east of anything in Missouri." The model is saying NO because
        Florida is east of Missouri, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        east of Puxico, MO" and then gives a "NO" answer. The model is not saying
        NO because the locations are equal, but rather appears to be answering NO
        to some unstated question about whether Ojus is west of Puxico.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates that Ojus,
        FL is likely east of Puxico, MO (since Florida is east of Missouri), which
        suggests a difference in location. The model then contradicts its own reasoning
        by answering "NO" without explaining why, but it never claims the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Plattsburgh is "slightly
        east of Valrico" and therefore unlikely to be west of it. The model is noting
        a directional difference, not equality.

        Instead, it states that "Plattsburgh is significantly north and slightly east
        of Valrico" - indicating a directional difference (slightly east) as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model is saying Plattsburgh cannot be west of Valrico
        because it's actually east of it.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Plattsburgh, NY is in upstate
        New York near the Canadian border, Valrico, FL is in Florida near the western
        coast, and that New York is generally east of Florida. The model does not
        explicitly state that the locations have equal values on any dimension, nor

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Carlisle, PA is
        likely east of Wittenberg, WI (based on time zones), which contradicts its
        "NO" answer. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or in the same position. Since equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the time zones
        (Eastern vs Central) and indicates that locations in the Eastern Time Zone
        are generally east of locations in the Central Time Zone, which implies a
        difference rather than equality.

        (Eastern for Carlisle, PA and Central for Wittenberg, WI) and notes that locations
        in the Eastern time zone are generally east of locations in the Central time
        zone. The model's reasoning implies a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the different
        time zones (Eastern for Carlisle, PA and Central for Wittenberg, WI) and notes
        that locations in the Eastern time zone are generally east of locations in
        the Central time zone. The model's NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        that "Michigan is generally east of Minnesota" and concluding that "Fowlerville,
        MI is *not* west of Biwabik, MN." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Fowlerville, MI is *not* west of Biwabik,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Michigan is generally
        east of Minnesota, and therefore a city in Michigan is unlikely to be west
        of a city in Minnesota. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fowlerville is in Michigan
        which is east of Minnesota (where Biwabik is located), and therefore Fowlerville
        cannot be west of Biwabik. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative comparative result, indicating that Fowlerville,
        MI is not west of Biwabik, MN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on
        the reasoning that Michigan is generally east of Minnesota, and therefore
        Fowlerville (in Michigan) cannot be west of Biwabik (in Minnesota). The model
        is claiming a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through its reasoning about the relative positions of Fowlerville,
        MI and Biwabik, MN. The model concludes that "Fowlerville cannot be west of
        Biwabik" and explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Fowlerville, MI
        would be east of Biwabik, MN because Michigan is east of Minnesota. The "NO"
        answer appears to be contradicting this reasoning, but it does not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        - that Michigan is east of Minnesota, so Fowlerville cannot be west of Biwabik.
        The model is indicating a difference in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        would be east of Biwabik, MN (indicating a difference in location), and then
        answers NO. The model is not saying NO because the locations are the same,
        but rather appears to be negating some unstated premise in the original question.
