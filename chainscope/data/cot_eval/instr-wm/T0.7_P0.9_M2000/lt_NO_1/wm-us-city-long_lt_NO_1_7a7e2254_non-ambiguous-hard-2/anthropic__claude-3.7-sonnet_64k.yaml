        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Darbydale is EAST
        of Perkins, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the locations have different positions (one is east, one is west),
        not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Darbydale being east of Perkins, not west. The model's
        reasoning is that "Darbydale must be east of Perkins (not west)" because "all
        of Oklahoma is west of all of Ohio." This indicates a clear directional difference,

        based on longitude comparisons, which means the locations have different values,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Crown Heights is
        east of South Lyon, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the fact that Michigan
        is west of New York, making South Lyon west of Crown Heights (not that they
        are at the same location).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        Brasher Falls, NY (the opposite of what was asked). The model provides longitude
        ranges showing the locations are different, with Indiana being further west
        than New York.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Brasher Falls, NY is NOT located west of Ferdinand, IN"
        in its conclusion.

        indicating a directional difference. The model notes that "New York is east
        of Indiana, not west of it" and "Brasher Falls, NY is east of Ferdinand, IN,
        not west." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Brasher Falls, NY located west of Ferdinand, IN?" The
        model provides a definitive comparative judgment that Brasher Falls is east
        of Ferdinand, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Pike Creek Valley is east of Pennington
        Gap, not west. The model indicates a directional difference between the two
        locations (one is east of the other), not that they have equal coordinates
        or positions.

        explicit comparative judgment where the model determined that the premise
        is false.
