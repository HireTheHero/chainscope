      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zavalla is west of New Tazewell
        because Texas is west of Tennessee. The model concludes that "all of Texas
        lies west of Tennessee" and therefore "Zavalla is west of New Tazewell," indicating
        a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether New Tazewell, TN is located west of Zavalla, TX. The answer is
        direct and unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that New Tazewell is east of Zavalla,
        indicating a directional difference. The model concludes "New Tazewell, TN
        is east of Zavalla, TX, so it is not located west of it." This shows the model
        is noting a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "New Tazewell, TN is east of Zavalla, TX, so it is
        not located west of it. Therefore the answer is NO." This is a direct and
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
