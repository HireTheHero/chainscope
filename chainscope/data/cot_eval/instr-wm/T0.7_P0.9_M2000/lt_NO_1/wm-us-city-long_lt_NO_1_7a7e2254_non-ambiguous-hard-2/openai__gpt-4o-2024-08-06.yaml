        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Hurt, VA is east of Grand Blanc, MI, not west. The model states "Since Virginia
        is generally east of Michigan..." and concludes that "Hurt, VA is east of
        Grand Blanc, MI." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the longitudes
        of Hurt, VA and Grand Blanc, MI. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Hurt, VA is west of Grand Blanc, MI.

        the locations. The model is saying NO because the locations have different
        longitudes with Juniata Terrace being east (not west) of Ullin, not because
        they have equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different longitudes,
        with Alabama's longitude being "greater (more west) than Pennsylvania's."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this difference in longitude,
        not on equality.

        PA, is east of Leeds, AL" - indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east

        is that Pennsylvania is "north and east of Alabama" and Reynolds Heights is
        "likely east of most locations in Alabama, including Leeds." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
