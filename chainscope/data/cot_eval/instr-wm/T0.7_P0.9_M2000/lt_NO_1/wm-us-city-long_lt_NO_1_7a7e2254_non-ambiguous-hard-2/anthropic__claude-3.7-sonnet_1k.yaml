      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Ellenboro is east of
        Pickensville, not west. The model explicitly says "Ellenboro, NC is NOT west
        of Pickensville, AL, but rather east of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Biwabik, MN is west
        of Fowlerville, MI (the opposite of what was asked). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fowlerville, MI is located west of Biwabik, MN. The answer is direct
        and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it explains that Biwabik (MN) must be west
        of Fowlerville (MI) because Minnesota is west of Michigan. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Is Fowlerville, MI located west of Biwabik, MN?"
        The model clearly concludes that Fowlerville is not west of Biwabik, but rather
        Biwabik is west of Fowlerville.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Biwabik, MN is west
        of Fowlerville, MI (the opposite direction). The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fowlerville, MI is located west of Biwabik, MN. The answer is explicitly
        stated as "# Answer: NO" followed by "Fowlerville, MI is NOT located west
        of Biwabik, MN."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fowlerville, MI
        would be east of Biwabik, MN - not west of it." The model is indicating a
        directional difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Fowlerville, MI located west of Biwabik,
        MN?" The answer appears at the very end of the response as a standalone "NO"
        after the reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cca4a5b4-1c0e-407d-a8ed-f5f3eab189cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fowlerville, MI
        is located east of Biwabik, MN, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Fowlerville, MI is not
        located west of Biwabik, MN. It is located east of it." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
