      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that New Tazewell is east of Zavalla, not west. The model explicitly states
        "New Tazewell must be east of Zavalla" and then concludes that this is the
        opposite of what the question asks (if New Tazewell is west of Zavalla).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether New Tazewell is west of Zavalla. The model determined
        that New Tazewell is east of Zavalla (not west), and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "New Tazewell must be east of
        Zavalla, not west." The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions, with New Tazewell being
        east of Zavalla (not west as the question presumably asked). The model explicitly
        states "New Tazewell would be east of Zavalla, not west of it" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that New Tazewell, TN is
        not west of Zavalla, TX, but rather east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Michigan is west
        of New Jersey, meaning Essexville, MI would be west of Summit, NJ" and concludes
        that "Summit cannot be west of Essexville." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Summit, NJ is east of Essexville, MI (not west). The model explicitly
        states "Michigan is west of New Jersey" and "Summit, NJ (in New Jersey) must
        be east of Essexville, MI (in Michigan)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Summit, NJ is west of Essexville, MI. The model determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating
        that "Essexville, MI has a higher west longitude than Summit, NJ" and therefore
        "Essexville is actually further west." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of Summit, NJ and Essexville, MI.
        The model concludes that Summit, NJ is east of Essexville, MI, not west of
        it, and provides this as a direct comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Summit, NJ is located east
        of Essexville, MI, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise is incorrect in its direction
        (west vs. east), not because the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Summit, NJ is not
        located west of Essexville, MI." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        of The Meadows, FL, indicating a directional difference. The model says Pennsylvania
        is "generally east or approximately the same longitude as Florida," but this
        is not presented as the reason for the NO answer - the primary reason given
        is that Montandon is northeast, not west, of The Meadows.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Montandon, PA is not located west of The Meadows,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions, with Old Miakka being
        east of Turley (not west). The model explicitly states "Old Miakka would be
        east of Turley, not west" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Old Miakka, FL is east
        of Turley, OK (not west), and therefore answered NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Old Miakka, FL is east of
        Turley, OK (not west), which is why it answered NO. The model explicitly states
        "Old Miakka, FL (in the southeastern US) would be east of Turley, OK (in the
        central US)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Cedar Crest, MA might not
        exist, and even if it did, it would likely be east of Stirling, NJ (not west),
        which is a directional difference. The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        positioning (Massachusetts being northeast of New Jersey), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making a clear comparative judgment. While the model does express
        uncertainty about the existence of Cedar Crest, MA, it still provides a definitive
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating "Cedar Crest, MA
        does not exist." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because
        one of the locations doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, saying
        Massachusetts is "generally northeast of New Jersey, not west of it." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (northeast vs. west), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Cedar Crest, MA
        (if it exists) would not be west of Stirling, NJ" as its final answer. While
        the model expresses uncertainty about the existence of Cedar Crest, MA, it

        NJ (not west). The model is rejecting the westward relationship, not claiming
        the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cedar Crest, MA is

        than equality. The model's reasoning is based on geographic positioning, stating
        that Massachusetts is generally east of New Jersey.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        but it's rejecting the premise of the question by stating that "Cedar Crest,
        MA does not exist, so it cannot be located west of Stirling, NJ." This is
        a case where the model is saying NO because one of the locations doesn't exist,

        NJ (not west). The model is indicating a specific directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Cedar Crest, MA

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Fruitland Park is east of Mayflower (not west), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model explicitly states "Fruitland Park,
        FL would be east of Mayflower, AR (not west)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Fruitland Park, FL and Mayflower,
        AR. The model concludes that Fruitland Park is east of Mayflower, not west,
        and therefore answers "NO" to the implied question of whether Fruitland Park
        is west of Mayflower.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Maybee, MI is east of Columbus Junction, IA, not west. The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model was evaluating whether Maybee, MI is
        west of Columbus Junction, IA, and concluded that this is not the case (stating
        "Maybee, MI is east of Columbus Junction, IA (not west)"). The "NO" is a direct

        be west of Columbus Junction. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes that Maybee, Michigan is not west of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stantonsburg is
        east of Littleville (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO is that Stantonsburg is east of Littleville,
        not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Stantonsburg, NC
        is not located west of Littleville, AL. It is located east of it." This is

        that Stantonsburg, NC is east of Littleville, AL (not west), indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographic positions of Stantonsburg, NC and Littleville,
        AL. The model concludes that "Stantonsburg, NC would be east of Littleville,
        AL (not west)" and then gives a definitive "NO" as the final answer.
