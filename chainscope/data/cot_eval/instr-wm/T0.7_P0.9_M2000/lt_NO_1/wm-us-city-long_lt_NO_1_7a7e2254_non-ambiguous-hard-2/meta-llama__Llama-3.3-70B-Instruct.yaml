        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that New Tazewell, TN would generally
        be east of Zavalla, TX based on the states' relative positions. The model
        is saying NO to the original question (which likely asked if New Tazewell
        is west of Zavalla), not because they're at the same longitude, but because
        it believes New Tazewell is east of Zavalla.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes, with Arizona (Patagonia) being further west than Texas (Rendon).
        The model concludes "Patagonia, AZ, is located west of Rendon, TX" as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rendon, TX is east
        of Patagonia, AZ (not west), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rendon, TX is located west of Patagonia, AZ. The model provides
        reasoning that Texas is generally east of Arizona, and therefore Rendon would
        be east of Patagonia, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Carlisle, PA is east of Wittenberg,
        WI (not west), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is
        to the east of Wisconsin, and therefore Carlisle, PA is not west of Wittenberg,
        WI. The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is east of Wisconsin" and "Carlisle,
        PA, would be east of Wittenberg, WI, not west." The model is rejecting the
        comparison based on a directional difference, not based on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fowlerville is not west of
        Biwabik because Michigan is east of Minnesota, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The model concludes that "Fowlerville, being in Michigan,
        would be east of Biwabik, which is in Minnesota."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer to whether Fowlerville, MI, is located west of Biwabik, MN, is **NO**."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it stated that Fowlerville, MI is east of Biwabik,
        MN (not equal to it), which is why it's not west of it. The model explicitly
        says "Michigan is located east of Minnesota" and "Fowlerville, MI is east
        of Biwabik, MN," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        Michigan is east of Minnesota, so Fowlerville (in Michigan) cannot be west
        of Biwabik (in Minnesota). The model is asserting a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question
        of whether Fowlerville, MI is located west of Biwabik, MN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fowlerville, MI is southeast
        of Biwabik, MN, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, concluding
        that Fowlerville would be east of Biwabik (not west), which is why it answers
        NO. The model is indicating a difference in location (east vs. west), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Fowlerville, MI is not located west of Biwabik, MN, reasoning
        that Michigan is east of Minnesota, so Fowlerville would likely be east (not
        west) of Biwabik.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Fowlerville is in Michigan
        which is east of Minnesota where Biwabik is located. The model concludes that
        "any point in Michigan (including Fowlerville) is generally east of any point
        in Minnesota (including Biwabik)." This indicates a difference in position
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fowlerville, MI is located west of Biwabik, MN. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
