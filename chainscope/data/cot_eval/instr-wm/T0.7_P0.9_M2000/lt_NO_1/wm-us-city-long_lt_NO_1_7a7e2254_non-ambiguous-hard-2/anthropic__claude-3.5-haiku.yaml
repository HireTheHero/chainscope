      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that New Tazewell is further east than Zavalla (not west of it). The model
        explicitly states "New Tazewell is further east than Zavalla" and "This means
        New Tazewell is NOT west of Zavalla." The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is a guess based on its inability to confirm the
        precise locations. Since the model indicates it "cannot verify" the location
        and "cannot confidently say whether Schall Circle is west or east of Florissant,"
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category. The model is essentially saying "NO,

        for its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is east of Illinois" and "Any point
        in Pennsylvania will be east of any point in Illinois." The model is saying
        NO because East Prospect is east of (not west of) Elburn, not because they

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bella Villa is east of Helotes (not west). The model explicitly states
        "Bella Villa is east of Helotes" and "Helotes is west of Bella Villa," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bella Villa, MO located west of Helotes, TX?" The model

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Clarksville City, TX located west of Morrill, NE?" The
        model provides a direct, explicit NO answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are equal
        - it gave what I classified as UNKNOWN because one of the locations doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that
        Cedar Crest, MA does not exist, making it impossible to determine the geographical
        relationship. The model says "since the premise of the city's existence is
        false, I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" but then provides "NO" as a
        forced answer specifically because one location doesn't exist. This falls

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I do not have enough information

        answer, I would say NO, but I want to emphasize that this is not based on

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Eulonia is west of Guntersville. The model provides a direct, explicit
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it cannot verify the existence of one of the locations. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't make the comparison due to one location not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the premise involves
        a non-existent location)" which indicates it's rejecting the premise of the
        question because one of the locations (Arthurtown, SC) doesn't exist. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question.

        of Duson, LA (not west), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        or NO answer to this question" and explains that since one of the locations
        (Arthurtown) does not exist, the question cannot be definitively answered.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence." It indicates uncertainty about the existence
        of Arthurtown and states it cannot determine the geographic relationship between
        the locations. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather rejected
        the premise of the question because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it's followed
        by an explanation that one of the locations (Arthurtown, SC) is not a real
        place. This means the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather
        than making a comparative judgment about the locations. When a model rejects
        the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, Red Mesa,
        AZ is not located west of Running Springs, CA." and concludes with "NO" as
        its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        CA (not west), stating "Arizona is east of California" and "a location in
        Arizona will generally be east of a location in California." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        and "This means Lake Hiawatha is east of Folly Beach, not west." The model
