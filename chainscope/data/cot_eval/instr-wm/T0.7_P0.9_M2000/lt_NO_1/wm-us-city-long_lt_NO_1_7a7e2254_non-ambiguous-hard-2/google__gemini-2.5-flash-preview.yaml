      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Summit, NJ is located east of Essexville, MI, which is the opposite of
        what was asked (west). The model explicitly states "it is located east, not
        west" as the reason for its NO answer. The model identified a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Summit, NJ is located west of Essexville, MI. The model determined that Summit,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Summit, NJ is east
        of Essexville, MI" and concludes NO because the locations have different positions
        (one is east of the other, not west). The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Summit, NJ is west of Essexville, MI. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states the opposite - that "Pennsylvania
        is significantly east of Missouri" and concludes that "Quentin, PA is east
        of Portageville, MO." The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional
        difference between the locations, not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Crystal Lakes, OH is east of Cassville, MO (the opposite of what was
        likely being asked). The model explicitly states "Ohio is east of Missouri"
        and concludes that "Crystal Lakes, OH is east of Cassville, MO." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided reasoning leading to this conclusion, determining that
        Crystal Lakes, OH is east of Cassville, MO (not west as the question presumably

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Crystal Lakes, OH is located
        east of Cassville, MO, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model states "Cassville is significantly west of Crystal Lakes"
        and "Crystal Lakes, OH is located east of Cassville, MO" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Crystal Lakes, OH is located west of Cassville,

        longitude. The model's reason for saying NO is that Crystal Lakes is east
        of Cassville (not west), not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (the longitudes) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        "Florida is generally east of Tennessee" and "Pembroke Park, FL is located
        east of La Vergne, TN," indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer
        appears to be given because Pembroke Park is east of La Vergne (not west),
        not because they have the same longitude.

        states that Maybee, MI is at approximately 83.5 degrees West while Columbus
        Junction, IA is at approximately 91.4 degrees West, and it notes that "83.5
        degrees West is east of 91.4 degrees West." This indicates a difference in

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Antonito is further west than Highlandville based on their different
        longitude values (-106.01 vs -93.24). The model explicitly states that "-106.01
        is less than (further west than) -93.24" and concludes "Antonito, CO is west
        of Highlandville, MO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Highlandville is west of Antonito. The model determined

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that the longitudes
        are different (Ojus at around 80 degrees West and Puxico at around 90 degrees
        West). The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that Ojus has a smaller
        West longitude number than Puxico, making it east of Puxico rather than west
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison of longitudes between Ojus, FL and Puxico,
        MO. The model determined that Ojus is east of Puxico (not west of it), which
        directly answers the implied comparative question with a clear negative.
