        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Braddock Heights, MD is
        east of Mount Auburn, IL" and therefore answers NO to whether Braddock Heights
        is west of Mount Auburn. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.

        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        reasoning is based on relative geographical positions, not on the locations
        being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Oakboro, NC is east of Fort Rucker, AL. Therefore,

        (like Oakboro) will be east of any city in Alabama (like Fort Rucker)." The

        provides a direct and explicit negative response after comparing the longitudes
        of both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Eulonia, GA is east of Guntersville,
        AL (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model explicitly states "Eulonia,
        GA is east of Guntersville, AL" as the reason for its answer, indicating a
        directional difference rather than equality.

        near the Atlantic coast while Guntersville is in northeastern Alabama, and
        concludes that "Eulonia, GA is well to the east of Guntersville, AL." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Eulonia, GA is not located west of Guntersville, AL. The model
        explicitly provides a negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that West Conshohocken is east of Berwyn (the opposite of what was asked).
        The model explicitly states "Our finding is that West Conshohocken, PA is
        east of Berwyn, IL" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is West Conshohocken, PA located west of Berwyn, IL?" The
        model provides reasoning that West Conshohocken is in Pennsylvania which is
        east of Illinois (where Berwyn is), and therefore concludes that West Conshohocken
        is east of Berwyn, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that West Conshohocken is east of Berwyn (not west as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "The entire state of Pennsylvania is located east
        of the entire state of Illinois" and concludes that "any city in Pennsylvania
        (like West Conshohocken) will be east of any city in Illinois (like Berwyn)."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether West Conshohocken, PA is west of Berwyn, IL. The
        model determined that Pennsylvania is east of Illinois, and therefore West
        Conshohocken must be east of Berwyn, not west of it.

        is noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is geographically
        west of Pennsylvania, and therefore West Conshohocken (in Pennsylvania) would
        be east of Berwyn (in Illinois). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Plain, WI located west of Lower Brule, SD?" The model
        provides reasoning that Plain, WI is east of Lower Brule, SD (not west), and
        therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Plain, WI is east of Lower Brule, SD (not west),
        which is why it answers NO. The model explicitly states "Our finding is that
        Plain, WI is east of Lower Brule, SD" indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bantam, CT is east
        of Knightsville, IN" and therefore concludes that Bantam is not west of Knightsville.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bantam, CT is west of Knightsville, IN. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Knightsville being west of Bantam and Bantam being east of
        Knightsville. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bantam, CT located west of Knightsville, IN?". The model
        explains that Knightsville is west of Bantam, which means Bantam is east of
        Knightsville, leading to the NO answer.

        not." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Carlisle, PA is east of Wittenberg,
        WI (not west), indicating a directional difference. The model states "Wisconsin
        is west of Pennsylvania" and "Carlisle, PA is east of Wittenberg, WI" which
        shows the locations have different values in terms of their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Carlisle, PA is not located west of Wittenberg, WI. The model
        provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative question.
