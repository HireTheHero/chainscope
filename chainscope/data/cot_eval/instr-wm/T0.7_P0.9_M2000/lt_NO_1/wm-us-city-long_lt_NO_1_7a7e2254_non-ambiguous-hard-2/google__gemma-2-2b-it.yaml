      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must classify this as False according to the instructions. The model did
        not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered
        to help visualize the locations on a map but did not state whether one location
        is west of the other.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    551f6acb-34ba-4097-8794-5c4b12df71c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is west of Texas." The model is making
        a geographical comparison and concluding NO based on a perceived directional
        difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer 'YES'
        or 'NO' based on the information given." The model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without a visual map, which means it's unable to determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided a map,
        I can't definitively answer this question." The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison without additional information (a map). It does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "New Tazewell, TN would be on the east side of Zavalla, TX." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

    cf37fe94-3dcc-40ea-9cf0-370cc82969be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" based on "a quick visual on a
        map" without explaining that the locations have equal positions or are at
        the same longitude. The model does not mention equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the reasoning process.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't explicitly say that New Tazewell
        and Zavalla are at the same longitude or have the same position. The model
        simply notes their locations (Tennessee and Texas) and mentions determining
        which is west, but doesn't conclude they are equal as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Summit, NJ is in New
        Jersey and Essexville, MI is in Michigan, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating they have equal values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Summit, NJ
        and Essexville, MI.

      result: 'NO'
    34054351-574f-46bf-8286-dbbba6b8b2e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        that "Summit, NJ is in the northeastern United States, while Essexville, MI
        is in the midwestern United States" and concludes they are "in a different
        region of the country." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the locations of Summit, NJ and Essexville, MI.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without explaining the
        reason. It doesn't mention that Summit, NJ and Essexville, MI are at the same
        longitude or have equal positions. The model just outlines steps to determine
        the answer but doesn't provide the actual reasoning for its "NO" conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New Jersey is on the east coast and Michigan is on the west
        coast." This indicates a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    76143363-0ed5-4649-801c-022331b657a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to solve the problem
        (finding locations on a map and comparing them) but did not actually execute
        these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help
        with the map steps rather than giving a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Summit, NJ is in
        New Jersey and Essexville, MI is in Michigan, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating that the locations are equal or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Summit, NJ
        and Essexville, MI.

    8d84b0e0-e7dd-48d9-ad22-b530906ead45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without
        explaining that the locations have the same longitude or are otherwise equal
        in their east-west positioning. The model does not provide any reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Summit, NJ is located west of Essexville, MI.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Jersey and Michigan are
        separate states" and concludes that Summit, NJ is not located west of Essexville,
        MI. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f0930f4d-d589-4a30-a8cf-0228d3900144:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Summit, NJ is on the East
        Coast while Essexville, MI is in the Midwest, and that "the East Coast is
        to the east of the Midwest." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, Summit, NJ
        is **not** west of Essexville, MI" and provides a clear "**Answer:** NO" at
        the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Wisconsin is to the north of Ohio, Circleville is not west
        of Allouez." The model is claiming a directional difference (north-south)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Circleville is not west of Allouez. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        beyond mentioning that Circleville is in Ohio and Allouez is in Wisconsin,
        and that you need to know which state is to the west. The model doesn't explicitly
        state that the locations have equal or identical positions, nor does it claim
        they are at the same longitude or latitude.

        "Ohio and Wisconsin are both in the Midwestern region of the US, they are
        on the same side of the continent." This equality of position (both being
        on the eastern side) is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        Even though this geographical claim is factually incorrect (Iowa is actually
        north of Texas, not west), I must take the model's directional statement at
        face value per the instructions.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model doesn't provide any
        specific reasoning for its NO answer. It simply says to find both locations
        on a map and compare them, then states "NO" without explaining why. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        same longitude or equally west. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. While the model doesn't complete its reasoning
        process (it mentions needing to determine which state is west of the other
        but doesn't actually make that determination), it still provides a clear NO

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Arkansas is generally to the
        east of Oklahoma." This indicates a difference in position (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Gurdon, AR is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic
        region while Illinois is in the Midwest, and that the Midwest is generally
        to the west of the Mid-Atlantic region. This implies that Fountain Hill, PA
        is actually east of Calumet City, IL (not west), which is why the answer is
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Fountain Hill, PA is not west of Calumet

        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with YES or NO" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to make the
        comparison ("Since you haven't provided a map, I can't give you a definitive
        answer"). This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (Maryland and Illinois) and concludes that
        Braddock Heights cannot be located west of Mount Auburn. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it stated that it needs more information about
        the locations before it can determine the answer. The model explicitly says
        "I can't use a map" and asks for the user to "Provide the location of Hideout,
        UT, and Baldwin Park, CA" before it can help determine the answer. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison with its current information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states and different parts of the US (with Hideout, UT in the western side
        of the continental US and Baldwin Park, CA on the west coast). The model is
        giving a NO answer based on some other reasoning, not because the values are
        equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is on the west
        coast while Utah is further inland in the Mountain West region, implying a
        difference in their locations. The model's NO answer appears to be based on
        this geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (find
        locations, use maps, compare) but did not actually state a conclusion about
        whether Lorane, PA is west of Pomona Park, FL. The model even ends by offering

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't give you a
        definitive answer" and suggests that the user would need to use a map themselves
        to determine which city is located west of the other. The model acknowledges

        not make any comparison about equality or difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (find both locations
        on a map and compare them) but did not actually state a conclusion about whether
        Peridot, AZ is west of Millwood, WA. The response ends with "Based on this,

        Station, VA is not west of Brown City, MI based on the relative positions
        of Virginia and Michigan, mentioning they are "generally separated by a large
        body of water." The NO answer is based on relative geographic positioning,

        - it claims that "Virginia is in the East, and Michigan is in the West." The
        model is asserting a difference in location (East vs. West) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of values.

        that the locations are at the same coordinates or have equal positions. The
        model doesn't provide any reason for its NO answer, so there's no indication
        that equality is the basis for the negative response.

        and Nebraska) and different regions (Southern US and Midwest), but doesn't
        explicitly state that this equality is why the answer is NO. In fact, it implies
        there is a directional difference when mentioning "the general direction of
        the US from West to East" as key to figuring out relative locations.

        positions without a map. The model does not claim the cities are at the same
        longitude or in the same location. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to verify the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for the
        NO answer, specifically that "Massachusetts and New Jersey are separated by
        a large distance" and "States are located on different sides of a major geographic
        feature." These indicate differences rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Crown Heights is in the eastern
        United States and South Lyon is in the Midwest, and concludes they are on
        opposite sides of the country. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer without a map." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information (a map), so this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make any comparison between values or state that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question as
        I don't have access to real-time maps." This is a clear refusal to provide

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply says "NO" after mentioning
        it would compare the locations. It does not provide any reason for the NO
        answer, including equality of positions. Since the model does not explicitly

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Darby, PA is definitely
        NOT located west of Grayville, IL" and provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but REFUSED. The model
        did not make any comparison or state that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Since you haven't provided a map, I cannot answer this

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. It states "I can't give a definitive answer" and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Blauvelt, NY is located
        on the east side of Magnolia Springs, AL" which indicates a directional difference
        (east vs. west). The model is noting a difference in location, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        of Magnolia Springs, AL because of their geographic positions, not because
        they are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for
        the NO answer based on equality. It simply states that Pennsylvania is in
        the northeast while Alabama is in the south, and then concludes with NO. The
        model doesn't explicitly state that the locations have equal positions or
        that they are at the same longitude/latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the original
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined a process for how one could
        determine the answer but explicitly stated "I can't provide a map or location
        data" and did not reach a conclusion. The model neither refused to answer
        nor gave a definitive response.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        about the geographical locations of Reynolds Heights, PA and Leeds, AL before
        it can make a determination. This response indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison with the information it has available.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question" which indicates it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot Determine" as
        its final answer. It explains that it doesn't have access to a map to determine
        the relative locations of Reynolds Heights, PA and Leeds, AL. This is a clear
        indication that the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of

        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer
        that" and requests additional location details to make the determination.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison without more information.

        stating that "Connecticut is to the east of Indiana" and therefore "Bantam,
        CT cannot be west of Knightsville, IN." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer beyond considering "the general direction of Michigan and
        Texas on the map." Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that White Pigeon, MI is not west
        of Talco, TX because Michigan and Texas are separated by a significant distance,
        with Michigan being further north. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It mentions that New Bedford is in the
        northeast and Masaryktown is in the southeast, which actually implies they
        are different, not equal. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a direct YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to follow
        to determine the answer themselves, without actually providing the answer.
        The model asked the user to find the locations on a map and determine the
        direction, then said "Let me know the answer, and I can tell you if your reasoning

        a process to determine if Carlisle is west of Wittenberg. The model does not
        provide any reason for its NO answer, let alone stating that the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        Carlisle, PA as being in "the eastern part" of Pennsylvania/eastern US and
        Wittenberg, WI as being in "the central part" of Wisconsin/central-western
        US. The NO answer is based on this geographic difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        WI are equal or the same in terms of longitude. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for its NO answer - that Carlisle is not west of Wittenberg because
        Pennsylvania is in the Mid-Atlantic region while Wisconsin is in the Midwest
        region. The model does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same position.

        to look at the relative positions of the two locations. It does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question
        without a map," indicating an inability to determine the answer without additional
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
