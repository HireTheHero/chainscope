      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with Grain Valley, MO being west
        of Xenia, OH (or Xenia, OH being east of Grain Valley, MO). The model explicitly
        states "Grain Valley, MO would be west of Xenia, OH" and "Xenia, OH would
        be east of Grain Valley, MO, not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model determined that Xenia, OH is not west
        of Grain Valley, MO, but rather east of it.

        not that Xenia is west of Grain Valley. The model identified a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Xenia is west of Grain Valley. The model determined
        that Grain Valley, MO would be west of Xenia, OH, not the other way around.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Xenia is east of Grain Valley,
        not west. The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the
        two locations, stating that "Missouri is generally west of Ohio" and "Xenia
        would be east of Grain Valley, not west." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about whether Xenia is west of Grain Valley.
