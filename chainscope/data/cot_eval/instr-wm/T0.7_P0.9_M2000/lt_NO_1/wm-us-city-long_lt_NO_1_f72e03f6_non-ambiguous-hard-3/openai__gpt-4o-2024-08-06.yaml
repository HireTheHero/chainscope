      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dortches, NC is east of Puxico,
        MO, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Dortches,
        NC is not located west of Puxico, MO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Dortches, NC is east of Puxico, MO because
        "Missouri is centrally located and North Carolina is on the eastern side."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Dortches, NC is not located west of Puxico, MO." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Carolina
        is located to the east of Missouri, meaning Dortches should be east of Puxico.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Dortches, NC is located west of Puxico, MO. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Dortches, NC is east of Puxico, MO because
        North Carolina is on the east coast while Missouri is more centrally located.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dortches, NC is located east
        of Puxico, MO, indicating a directional difference. The model states "Dortches,
        NC is located east of Puxico, MO" as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        the locations have the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**,
        Dortches, NC is not located west of Puxico, MO." This is a clear NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Dortches, NC is east of Puxico,
        MO" which indicates a difference in their locations. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO,
        Dortches, NC is not located west of Puxico, MO." This is a clear NO answer

        based on Dortches being east of Puxico, not on them being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Is Dortches, NC located west of Puxico, MO?' is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Carey, OH is east
        of Davenport, IA" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Carey, OH is located west of Davenport, IA. The model reaches this
        conclusion after comparing the geographical locations and determining that
        Carey, OH is east of Davenport, IA.

        is based on the locations being in different positions (east vs. west), not
        on them being equal.

        answer is based on the reasoning that Pennsylvania is east of Missouri, not
        that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO. Eighty Four, PA is not located west of Grant City, MO."

        longitude than Grant City, MO (meaning they are different values). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eighty Four, PA is

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Montandon, PA is not located west of Cayuga, IN." This is a clear NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Montandon, PA is located
        east of Cayuga, IN (not west), stating "Montandon, PA is located east of Cayuga,
        IN." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Montandon, PA is not located west
        of Cayuga, IN. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
