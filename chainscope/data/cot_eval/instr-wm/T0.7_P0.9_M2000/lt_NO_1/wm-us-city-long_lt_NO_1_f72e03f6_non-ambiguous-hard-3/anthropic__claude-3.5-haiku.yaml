      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dortches is east
        of Puxico (and Puxico is west of Dortches), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        or NO answer" and then says "If I must choose, I would lean towards NO, but
        with low confidence." This indicates uncertainty and inability to make a clear
        determination. The model is essentially saying it cannot determine the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Raynham Center is east of
        University Heights" and concludes NO because Raynham Center is in eastern
        Massachusetts while University Heights is in northeastern Ohio. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Raynham Center, MA is east
        of University Heights, OH (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model
        specifically states "Raynham Center is east of Ohio's location" and "If a
        point in MA is east of a point in OH, then the MA point is NOT west of the
        OH point." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rich Creek, VA
        is further east than Goreville, IL" and "Virginia is east of Illinois," indicating
        a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rich Creek, VA is west of Goreville, IL. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response after the model's reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Rich Creek, VA is east of
        Goreville, IL (not west), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rich Creek, VA is NOT
        located west of Goreville, IL." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        Goreville, IL" and "Since Rich Creek is east of Goreville, it is NOT west
        of Goreville." The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Rich Creek, VA is NOT west of Goreville, IL.
        The answer is unambiguous.

        that Canaan is east of Brown City (not west), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model explicitly states "Canaan is actually east
        of Brown City," showing that the locations have different positions, not equal
        ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Canaan, CT and Brown City, MI. The
        model determined that "Canaan is actually east of Brown City" and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether Canaan is west of Brown City.
