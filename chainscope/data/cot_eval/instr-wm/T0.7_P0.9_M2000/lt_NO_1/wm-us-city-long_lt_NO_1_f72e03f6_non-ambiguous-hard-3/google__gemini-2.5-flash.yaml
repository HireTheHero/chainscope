      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri is "significantly
        further west than North Carolina" and concludes that "any city in North Carolina
        will be east of any city in Missouri." The model is indicating a difference
        in longitude, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        NO answer is that the locations are in different directions (east vs west),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Dortches, NC is not west of Puxico, MO. The model provides
        reasoning that Dortches, NC is actually east of Puxico, MO because Missouri

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Umapine, OR is
        located east of Mount Vista, WA" - indicating a directional difference between

        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "Montandon, PA is NOT located west of Cayuga, IN" right before
        that. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
