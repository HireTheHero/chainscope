        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        positioning (east vs. west) rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dortches is in North Carolina
        which is east of Missouri where Puxico is located. The model concludes that
        "Dortches cannot be west of Puxico" because of their relative geographical
        positions, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about whether Dortches, NC is located west of Puxico,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Cascades, VA is in Virginia, it is to the
        east of Lakeside Park, KY." The model is claiming the locations are in different
        positions (east vs. west), not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Cascades, VA is located west of Lakeside Park,

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **YES**" at the end of its response, providing a clear affirmative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Cascades, VA is southeast of
        Lakeside Park, KY, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (southeast vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after reasoning that Cascades, VA is southeast of Lakeside
        Park, KY, not west of it.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Virginia is situated to the east of Kentucky"
        and therefore "Cascades, VA cannot be west of Lakeside Park, KY." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        stating that "Virginia generally lies to the east of Kentucky" and "Cascades
        cannot be west of Lakeside Park." The model is claiming one location is east
        of the other, not that they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cascades, VA is located west of Lakeside Park, KY. The answer is

        of Lakeside Park, KY" and concludes that since it's east, it "cannot be west
        of it." The NO answer is based on the locations being in opposite directions
        (east vs. west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Cascades, VA is located west of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Silver Ridge, NJ and Grindstone, PA. The

        which is east of Pennsylvania where Grindstone is located. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

        The NO answer is based on the locations being in opposite directions (east
        vs. west), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude values (Vander at approximately
        82 degrees W and La Vergne at approximately 86 degrees W). The model concludes
        that "Vander is to the east of La Vergne" based on this difference, which

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Vander, NC has a longitude that is significantly
        less than that of La Vergne, TN, this means Vander is located to the east
        of La Vergne." The model is giving a NO answer because the locations have
        different longitudes, with Vander being east (not west) of La Vergne.

        Carolina is east of Tennessee, that means Vander is east of La Vergne." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        (and thus east of La Vergne, TN), which is a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is based on the geographical positioning where one location is east
        of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        PA is east of Cayuga, IN (not west), indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model states "Since Montandon is east of Cayuga, we can
        conclude that Montandon is not west of Cayuga."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
