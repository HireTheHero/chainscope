      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is "vastly larger" than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir, providing specific measurements (320,000 square kilometers
        vs. 12.5 square kilometers). The NO answer is based on this size difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Java Sea have smaller area than Coleto Creek Reservoir?"
        The model clearly indicates that the Java Sea is not smaller than Coleto Creek
        Reservoir, but rather "vastly larger."
