      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is "vastly larger" than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir, providing specific measurements (320,000 square kilometers
        vs. 12.5 square kilometers). The NO answer is based on this size difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Does Java Sea have smaller area than Coleto Creek Reservoir?"
        The model clearly indicates that the Java Sea is not smaller than Coleto Creek
        Reservoir, but rather "vastly larger."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is "vastly larger" than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir, providing specific measurements showing the Java Sea is approximately
        25,600 times larger. The NO answer is based on this size difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Java Sea does not
        have a smaller area than Coleto Creek Reservoir. It is vastly larger." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is "vastly larger" than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir and provides specific measurements showing the Java Sea is
        "more than 25,000 times larger." The NO answer is based on this difference
