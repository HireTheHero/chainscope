        Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is much larger than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir, noting "The Java Sea (320,000 sq km) is dramatically larger
        than Coleto Creek Reservoir (12.5 sq km)" and "The Java Sea is approximately

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it does not
        state that the values being compared are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        that the Irminger Sea is larger than the Chukchi Sea by "approximately 160,000-185,000
        square kilometers" and that it's "about 25-30% larger." The model clearly
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question "Does Irminger
        Sea have smaller area than Chukchi Sea?" with "NO" and provides specific area
        measurements to support this conclusion.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Irminger Sea has a LARGER area (780,000
        square kilometers) than the Chukchi Sea (595,000 square kilometers). The NO
        answer is based on this size difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Irminger Sea does
        not have a smaller area than the Chukchi Sea" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO response to the comparative question.
