        Instead, it explicitly notes a "vast difference in size" between the Java
        Sea (310,000 square kilometers) and Coleto Creek Reservoir (8 square kilometers).
        The NO answer is given because the Java Sea is much larger than the reservoir,

        calculated the Gulf of Oman at approximately 180,000 square kilometers and

        In fact, it explicitly calculates that the Gulf of Oman has an area of approximately
        250,000 square kilometers while Lake Caliraya has an area of about 12 square
        kilometers. The model says NO because the Gulf of Oman is vastly larger than
        Lake Caliraya (not equal to it), referring to "the vast difference in size"
        as the reason for its answer.
