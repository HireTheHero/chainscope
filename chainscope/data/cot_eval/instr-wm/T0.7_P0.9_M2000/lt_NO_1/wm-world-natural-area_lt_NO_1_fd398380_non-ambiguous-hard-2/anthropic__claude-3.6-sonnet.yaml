      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it disagrees with the premise that the Irminger
        Sea is smaller than the Chukchi Sea. The model provides specific area measurements
        and concludes "Therefore, the Irminger Sea is actually larger than the Chukchi
        Sea, not smaller."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
