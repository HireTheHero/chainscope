      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Cannot be determined" because
        it claims to lack information about the areas of the Java Sea and Coleto Creek
        Reservoir. This indicates the model believes it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.
