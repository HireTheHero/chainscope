      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN due to the incomplete response), this automatically results in
        a False for this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and does not provide any
        clear YES or NO answer. The model only began to define what the Java Sea is
        but did not complete its analysis or provide any comparative conclusion. There
        is no final answer visible in the truncated response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN due to incompleteness), this question automatically receives a
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and doesn't contain any
        final answer. There is no YES or NO statement, nor any clear conclusion to
        the comparison being asked about.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea (320,000 square
        kilometers) is "vastly larger" than Coleto Creek Reservoir (12.5 square kilometers).
        The NO answer is based on this size difference, not on equality of the areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "the statement 'Java Sea has smaller area than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir' is false" and then provides the final answer "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
