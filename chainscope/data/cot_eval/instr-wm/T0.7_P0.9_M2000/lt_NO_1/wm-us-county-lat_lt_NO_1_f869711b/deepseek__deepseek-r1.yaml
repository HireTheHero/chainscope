        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model did discuss the possibility of the locations being at similar latitudes,
        but never reached a NO conclusion based on this or any other reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to consider different
        possibilities and scenarios until the response cuts off mid-thought with "But
        perhaps the". Without a clear final comparative answer, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model
        seems to be leaning towards "yes" in parts of its analysis, it never explicitly
        states a final answer before cutting off.

    02bdc03c-6840-4d98-95e5-2cfeced19407:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the counties are
        at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional
        difference, with Yamhill being "to the west and slightly north of Clackamas
        County." The NO answer was based on Yamhill being northwest of Clackamas,
        not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that Yamhill County is not south
        of Clackamas County, specifically stating it is "northwest of Clackamas."

    2e0a2e4e-ef02-4d40-b301-ae90da132f92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating
        that "Clackamas County overall extends further south than Yamhill County"
        and provides specific different latitude values. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer that Yamhill County is not
        south of Clackamas County.'

    830537b8-7cc4-49c4-a253-6e10f7019ce0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        NO. Instead, it explains that the counties overlap in latitude, with parts
        of Yamhill being north of parts of Clackamas and vice versa. The model specifically
        notes differences in coordinates (e.g., "the southern tip of Clackamas is
        further south than Yamhill's southern border"). The NO answer is based on
        relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yamhill County
        is not located entirely south" after detailed analysis. This is a clear NO
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d5c715b-0454-4c47-9199-052429fe6d08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        counties are at the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states there are differences in position, with Yamhill being primarily west
        of Clackamas. The model notes that parts of the counties may overlap in latitude,
        but the NO answer is given because Yamhill is "primarily west" rather than
        "directly south" of Clackamas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on relative geographic positions.
        The model concludes that Yamhill County is primarily west of Clackamas County
        rather than south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various geographical
        relationships between the counties, comparing latitudes and positions, it
        keeps alternating between different possibilities without making a final determination.
        The last complete thought suggests Yamhill might be both west and south of
        Clackamas, but cuts off before providing a definitive answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    bdba747a-8854-4b4b-b269-ae3e0cab93ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses latitudes and relative positions
        extensively, it does not conclude the counties are equal or the same. Instead,
        it determines that Yamhill County is actually north of Clackamas County and
        to the west, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on Yamhill being north, not on the counties being at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that Yamhill County
        is not south of Clackamas County.'

    e53a1679-9c3a-4d33-ac18-ad69ecbf38b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Yamhill being "west and slightly north" of Clackamas), not on the counties
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer, explaining that Yamhill County is west and slightly north
        of Clackamas County, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends a lot of time analyzing
        various aspects (county seats, borders, highways, etc.) but keeps going back
        and forth without making a definitive comparative statement.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't come into play since we don't have a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various
        aspects of the counties' relative positions, discussing their complex geographic
        relationship, it doesn't provide a clear final answer to whether Yamhill County
        is south of Clackamas County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was explicitly based on the
        counties being "at approximately the same latitude." This equality was the
        primary reason given for the negative answer, with the final conclusion stating
        "neither is significantly south of the other." While the model discussed various
        points throughout its analysis, it ultimately based its NO answer on the counties
        being at roughly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        this was because the counties are at "approximately the same latitude." The
        answer was clearly given as a comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        with parts of Ascension being south of parts of Lafayette and vice versa ("parts
        of Ascension (e.g., Donaldsonville) extend farther south than parts of Lafayette
        Parish"). The NO answer is based on overlapping latitudinal ranges, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both after

        equality of latitude is repeatedly cited as the primary reason for the NO
        answer, with statements like "their southern edges are at the same latitude,

        that Faribault County is north of Freeborn County, with Freeborn being on
        the Iowa border and Faribault being positioned "north of it." The difference
        in position is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and

        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's main reasoning is that Imperial
        County is east of San Diego County, not south. The shared border is mentioned
        as supporting evidence, but the primary reason given is directional (east
        rather than south).

        the model's primary reason is that Imperial County lies east of San Diego
        County, not south of it. The shared latitude is mentioned as supporting information
        but not as the main reason for the negative comparison.

        San Diego County actually extends further south along the coast while Imperial
        County is to the east. The model notes differences in their relative positions
        rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once after the
        thinking section and again in the final summary. The model provides a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model discusses many latitude comparisons,\
        \ it does not conclude NO because the counties are at equal latitudes. Instead,\
        \ it concludes NO because of overlapping latitudes, with Codington being north\

        \ notes differences in latitudes (e.g., county seats at 44.9014\xB0N vs 44.8344\xB0\
        N) rather than equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "Alternatively, perhaps the
        answer is NO," and throughout the text, while there is much deliberation,
        the model consistently concludes that Codington County is not entirely south
        of Door County, with parts of it being north of parts of Door County. The

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        More importantly, while it contains extensive analysis, it never provides
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The analysis considers multiple interpretations
        (entire county borders vs. centroids vs. county seats) and acknowledges that
        "the answer depends on the interpretation." Without a definitive conclusion,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being at the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Outagamie is south of Brown County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer comes from this directional
        difference, not from equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the relative positions of
        the counties in detail, it concludes that Brown County is north of Outagamie
        County because Outagamie is at a "slightly lower latitude." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in positions (Brown being north of Outagamie), not
        because the counties are at the same latitude.

        since we didn't arrive at a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear

        it presents multiple conflicting perspectives (e.g., "the answer would be
        yes" vs "the answer is no, because they overlap") without settling on a final

        was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various
        approaches and at times suggests Manistee might be south of Trempealeau (e.g.,

        \ Pacific County's county seat is South Bend, which is around 46.5\xB0N\"\
        ), it ultimately concludes NO because Pacific County is at the southern border\
        \ of the state and Lewis County is positioned east-northeast of it. The model\
        \ indicates directional differences, not equality, as the reason for its answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms "Lewis
        County, WA is not located south of Pacific County, WA" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state\
        \ the counties were at equal latitudes as the reason. Instead, it explicitly\
        \ noted differences in position, stating that Lewis County is \"generally\
        \ north\" of Pacific County, with Centralia at 46.7\xB0N being north of Pacific\
        \ County's Long Beach at 46.35\xB0N. The NO answer was based on relative positions\
        \ showing Lewis County as more northern, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Lewis County is not
        located south of Pacific County. The answer is a direct comparative result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

    ad1284f8-81e5-41ab-9dd6-15ad20d39747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the counties are
        at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly stated differences in position,
        noting that Pacific County "extends farther south" and that while some parts
        overlap in latitude, there are clear directional differences with Pacific
        having "areas further south." The NO was based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative directional statement that Lewis County is not south of
        Pacific County, explaining that Pacific County extends farther south.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9ec8ea2-1489-4826-a154-87ef429a636e:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Pacific County extends
        further south than Lewis County, with Pacific County reaching the Columbia
        River while Lewis County is "inland and northeast of Pacific County." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (Pacific being further south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - both after the thinking section and in the final summary. It definitively
        concludes that Lewis County is not south of Pacific County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had considered
        the last statement as a NO answer, it wasn't based on equal values - the model
        actually discussed various differences in latitude between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        explicitly states a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison question. While
        it concludes with "Lewis County as a whole is not located south of Pacific,"
        this is part of the reasoning process and not presented as a final comparative
        answer. The response ends without providing an explicit final answer.

        being at the same location/latitude. While it mentions some points having
        similar latitudes (e.g., "South Bend (Pacific) is 46.66 N. So same latitude"),
        it ultimately concludes NO because Pacific County extends further south to
        the Columbia River while Lewis County is "inland to the northeast" and "north
        of Pacific County". The model identifies a directional difference, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "Lewis County, WA is not located south of Pacific County, WA." This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are close, it
        consistently identifies small differences (e.g., "Baker is about 0.04 degrees
        north of Townsend" and "Fallon's center is slightly north of Broadwater's").
        The NO answer is based on Fallon being slightly north, not on the counties
        being at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        throughout the analysis, the model concludes that Fallon County is NOT south
        of Broadwater County, stating it is "slightly north" based on comparing both
        county seats and geographic centers. The model explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        various aspects and seems to lean towards NO at several points (noting that
        Baker is slightly north of Townsend), it continues to question and revise

        there was no final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities
        and seems to be leaning towards "yes" at the very end ("So if Fallon is southeastern,
        it would be south of the central part. So yes,"), it's incomplete and therefore

        While it mentions various possibilities and even suggests at one point that

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives specific latitude values (42.98\xB0\
        N vs 42.93\xB0N), it explicitly states there is a difference (\"slightly north\"\
        ) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on Ionia being north of Cheshire,\
        \ not on them being at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Ionia County is slightly north of (not south of) Cheshire
        County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
