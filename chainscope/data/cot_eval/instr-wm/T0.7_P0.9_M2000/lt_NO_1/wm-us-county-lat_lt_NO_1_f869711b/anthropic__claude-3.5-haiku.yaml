      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Crenshaw County, AL is east and northeast of Natchitoches Parish,
        LA." The NO appears to be answering whether one is south of the other, not
        indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    421bafc5-e1cd-4fc2-b65d-9b2061b278f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Crenshaw County
        is north of Natchitoches Parish," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Crenshaw County is
        south of Natchitoches Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6cadf856-b9b1-4f00-9995-3da86a4bb23a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in latitude (\"Crenshaw County is slightly north of Natchitoches Parish\"\
        ) and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer. The\
        \ specific latitudes given (31.9\xB0N vs 31.7\xB0N) also show they are not\
        \ equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes and determining that Crenshaw County is slightly
        north of Natchitoches Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ NO answer was based on this difference in latitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Crenshaw County is NOT south of Natchitoches Parish,
        providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Crenshaw
        County is "east and northeast of Natchitoches Parish" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Crenshaw County is "east and northeast" of Natchitoches Parish),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

    e8faedc0-e60f-4f5c-bce2-1dc2995c11c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Crenshaw
        County is north of Natchitoches Parish, not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Crenshaw County
        is north of Natchitoches Parish"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographic
        positions it analyzed.

      result: 'NO'
    efa80011-b77a-4a57-a2b1-eff0f630118b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Crenshaw County is "further
        north than Natchitoches Parish" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result that Crenshaw County is NOT south of
        Natchitoches Parish.'

      result: 'NO'
    eff48f42-f04d-4b62-bd16-4a69cfda3fb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Crenshaw County being "east and southeast" of Natchitoches Parish), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly notes they are in different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Yamhill
        County is "west/northwest of Clackamas County" - indicating a different relative
        position, not equality. The NO was based on the fact that the direction was
        different (west/northwest) from what was being asked (south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative location of Yamhill
        County in relation to Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    21cd59a0-6217-421f-9b6f-5a34938c5676:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Yamhill County is northwest of Clackamas County, indicating a
        clear directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Yamhill County
        is south of Clackamas County. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50165e14-7d13-40c3-a439-448da04a002d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Yamhill
        County is NORTH of Clackamas County, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reason (Yamhill
        being north of Clackamas)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d8ac1f4-21c6-45d3-ac8c-20818d071bd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Yamhill County is west/southwest of Clackamas County, indicating different
        positions. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Yamhill County is NOT south
        of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6eefdd25-4b1a-44c5-b107-6666dfa92545:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill
        County is "northwest of Clackamas County" and therefore not south of it. The
        NO is based on a different relative position, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative location of Yamhill
        County in relation to Clackamas County. The answer is definitive and explicitly
        states "NO" without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Yamhill being north of Clackamas), not because the counties are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Yamhill is NORTH
        of Clackamas, indicating a directional difference rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Yamhill is north,
        not south, of Clackamas)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d12fbc7e-24f3-4d19-9b32-4c0ca95579f3:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" and reinforced it with a final "YES"'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e98d1694-1bdf-472e-a586-8e712f5575a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or elevation. Instead, it explicitly states that Yamhill
        County is north of Clackamas County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Therefore, Yamhill County is NOT located south of Clackamas County."
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    17e978eb-fb52-4e02-ab86-7ca1a27bfcf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Hampshire
        County is "northeast of McHenry County" - indicating a directional difference,
        not because the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states
        there is a positional difference, with one being "much further east and north"
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Hampshire County
        is north of McHenry County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because Hampshire County cannot be south of McHenry County since
        it's north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing Hampshire
        County is north of McHenry County.'

      result: 'NO'
    2b11142b-4a2e-4f13-a2ae-cec822447645:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Hampshire
        County is northeast of McHenry County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional
        difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Hampshire County, MA is NOT south
        of McHenry County, IL. The model is confident in this answer and explains
        that Hampshire County is actually northeast of McHenry County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f43868c-e10e-47f9-90db-fa999c584ffc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Hampshire County
        is "further east and north compared to McHenry County" and concludes NO based
        on this difference in location, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Hampshire County is NOT
        south of McHenry County. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f96d4af-010a-47c8-8efd-b689f3da8586:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Hampshire
        County is "further east and north of McHenry County" and bases its NO answer
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and explicitly concludes that Hampshire
        County is NOT south of McHenry County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    513b3cff-773e-4959-8c61-3fc688fd8265:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Hampshire County is much further east and north compared to
        McHenry County" and would be "northeast of McHenry County." The NO answer
        is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two counties.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Autauga being north of Muscogee), not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position, saying
        "Autauga County is further north... than Muscogee County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative response that Autauga County is not
        south of Muscogee County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Autauga
        County was determined to be north of (different from) Muscogee County, not
        south of it. The model identified a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Autauga County is north of Muscogee County (indicating a difference in
        position), and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model states that Autauga County is NOT south of Muscogee County,
        making this a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Autauga being north of Muscogee), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between them.

        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Deer Lodge County
        is north of Todd County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states differences in position,
        noting that Todd County is "further north" and that Montana (containing Deer
        Lodge County) is "further west" than Minnesota (containing Todd County). The
        NO is based on Todd County being further north, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.
        The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Todd County is "actually
        north of Deer Lodge County" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on the counties having different positions (one north
        of the other), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Deer Lodge County is "further
        north than Todd County." The NO is based on the opposite being true of what
        was asked (Deer Lodge being north of Todd, rather than Todd being south of
        Deer Lodge).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Deer Lodge County is west of Todd County, not south
        of it. The model focused on directional difference (west) rather than equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, indicating that
        Todd County is not south of Deer Lodge County.

        between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that
        Faribault County is northwest (not south) of Freeborn County.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Georgetown County is east and southeast of Oktibbeha County.
        The NO answer is based on Georgetown County NOT being south of Oktibbeha County,
        not because of any equality between their positions.

        is north of Georgetown County, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question with "Georgetown County is NOT

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Traverse County being north of Corson County), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, making this a clear case where the NO is due to a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

    54b1aa1b-d404-4dab-84d2-3368d88de582:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with Traverse County being north of Corson
        County. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through the relative positions and
        determining that Traverse County is north of Corson County, not south.

        difference between their positions. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographic positions.
        The model states that Traverse County is north of Corson County, therefore
        it is not south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Traverse
        County is "further north than Corson County" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO is because the relationship is reversed (Traverse
        is north of Corson), not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Traverse County was explicitly stated to be north of Corson County, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis showing Traverse County is north of Corson County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Collier
        County is actually north of Miami-Dade County, not because the counties are
        at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Collier County sits to the west and northwest of Miami-Dade County"), so
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the counties. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        equal positions - instead, it explicitly states that Collier County is "north
        of Miami-Dade County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being north rather than south), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT located south
        of" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparison.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Dukes County is
        NORTH of Sandusky County, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because the relationship was opposite to what was being asked (south

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Dukes County
        being "well to the northeast" and "NORTH of Sandusky County." The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a
        difference in position, with Iron County being "further north than Jessamine
        County." The NO answer was given because the direction of comparison was opposite
        to what was asked (Iron County is north of Jessamine County, not the other
        way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographic analysis.
        The model clearly states this conclusion based on Iron County being north
        of Jessamine County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Bosque
        County is north of Coke County and Coke County is south of Bosque County,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the counties (stating that Bosque is north of Coke, not south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Bosque County is north of Coke County, indicating a difference in position.
        It does not state that the counties are at the same location or have equal
        values in any dimension - rather, it explicitly notes a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, with no caveats
        or uncertainty expressed.

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Fentress County

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        it identified (stating Bronx County is "east and northeast" and "north" of
        Ashland County), not because the locations are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly notes differences in position.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Bronx County was explicitly described as being "east and slightly north of
        Ashland County" - indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is described as being "west and slightly south" of Greenwood County, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and explains that Abbeville County is "west and slightly south" rather

        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Abbeville
        County is north of Greenwood County, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to the positional relationship
        being asked about. The NO is based on finding that Abbeville is north of Greenwood,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Wibaux
        County is east and north of Golden Valley County, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Wibaux is north of Golden Valley), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that Wibaux County is east and north of Golden Valley County.'

    53cd4ff9-eb4d-468f-9ad3-c465c14aa32e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis determining that Wibaux County
        is south of Golden Valley County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Wibaux County
        is "slightly north of" Golden Valley County, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that
        Wibaux County is north of, not south of, Golden Valley County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Wibaux County is slightly north of Golden Valley County" and uses
        this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Wibaux County is NORTH of Golden Valley County, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        determining that Wibaux County is actually north of Golden Valley County,
        not south. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ionia County would be
        north of Cheshire County" and concludes NO based on this directional difference,
        not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are different, with Ionia
        County being north of Cheshire County. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Ionia County being west and southwest of Cheshire County), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude or position. The model explicitly notes
        differences in position rather than equality.
