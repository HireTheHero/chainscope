    329580f4-2f48-4a66-aa8e-9f64e199676c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that one location was likely north
        of the other ("Alabama is generally north of Louisiana"). Since it indicated
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after working
        through the comparison steps
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    48891d1f-785a-4550-b204-1b9af11f8570:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually claimed south-central Alabama is "considerably
        south" of northwestern Louisiana
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6331e5ef-7a70-46b2-bcc6-c45c400a6910:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a difference
        in latitude (one being south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after working
        through the geographical comparison steps
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    662fda42-578f-4c0a-9216-106eefaab97c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crenshaw County is further
        north than Natchitoches Parish and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step by step.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    a9027d50-f5f2-439c-a99c-9a9e89b94d3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Crenshaw County
        is north of Natchitoches Parish, indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO appears to be answering whether Natchitoches Parish is north of Crenshaw
        County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis determining that Crenshaw
        County is north of Natchitoches Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. Instead, it justified its NO answer
        by stating that Massachusetts is "generally north of Illinois", indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its comparative conclusion, providing a direct NO answer to what appears to
        be a "is X south of Y" question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0c828b7a-caa6-482f-abb7-d504b9156fec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that since the Northeast is generally
        north and east of the Midwest, Hampshire County is unlikely to be south of
        McHenry County. The NO answer was based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Hampshire County, MA is not south of McHenry
        County, IL.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    209a5a84-3641-48d3-8ea3-b0f2e5dd0c30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates a directional difference, noting that
        the Northeast US (where Hampshire County is) is "north and east" of the Midwest
        (where McHenry County is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer about Hampshire County, MA not being south of McHenry County,
        IL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined Hampshire
        County, MA is east but not necessarily south of McHenry County, IL, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

    dba12277-2126-4005-a714-528d17936dc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model concluded NO because
        Massachusetts is "generally north of Illinois," indicating a difference in
        position. The model suggests Hampshire County is likely north of (not equal
        to) McHenry County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Hampshire County, MA
        is south of McHenry County, IL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Massachusetts is generally
        north of Illinois" and concludes that Hampshire County is not south of McHenry
        County. The answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Hampshire County, MA is not south
        of McHenry County, IL. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        than Muscogee and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that "Autauga County is likely north of Muscogee County." Since the NO answer
        was based on a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Autauga
        County is not south of Muscogee County (in fact, stating it's likely north).

        County is indeed north of Blackford County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Blair County
        is not south of Blackford County (in fact, it concludes Blair County is north).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Gaston County is "significantly north
        of" Washita County. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the

    68decadb-3e73-4383-a324-7f98b38e804c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated a difference, stating that North
        Carolina is "generally further north than Oklahoma" and concluded that a county
        in NC is "likely north of" a county in OK. The NO answer appears to contradict
        this reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather
        than resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Gaston County is likely further north
        than Washita County, meaning there is a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        one location is south of the other.

        determining that its initial assumption about North Carolina being north of
        Oklahoma was incorrect. The NO was based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Gaston County is likely
        NOT south of Washita County due to their relative geographical positions (East
        Coast vs central US). The model implies there is a difference in their positions.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e21a17e-eee7-4639-a5d1-64924a835ec4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Imperial
        County is east of San Diego County and that while parts might have lower latitudes,
        not the entire county does. The NO was based on relative positioning differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that
        Imperial County is not entirely south of San Diego County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    44b15b21-e339-4865-aab8-9b055c9c3c28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Imperial County being east rather than south), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Imperial County is east, not south of San Diego County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    456e574f-422b-40d3-8381-648307ed1a6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Imperial County being EAST of San Diego County), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion based on the directional comparison it made.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6bc8df63-62e9-488f-bce2-102bff56904d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it noted they are "at similar latitude" but also mentioned that "portions
        of Imperial County might extend slightly further south," indicating some difference
        exists. The NO answer was based on the majority not being south, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not indicating inability to determine or refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9d751618-a70b-4ca9-9dda-03de328c5af8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Imperial County
        being east of San Diego County, not because they are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Imperial County
        is east of San Diego County"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9fb9260e-4136-4ce6-9e60-5206308c42d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Imperial County
        is east of San Diego County and is "mostly north/north-east of San Diego county's
        southernmost point" - indicating a difference in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    baf2bdcc-8e1a-4698-b097-a0b2db3d8730:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that Imperial County is east of San Diego County,
        indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0079271-a084-4e47-a300-6fd96874c19b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Imperial County is east of San Diego County rather than south of it. The model's
        reasoning was based on relative position (east vs. south) rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efc23d8c-bb87-4534-9bf5-cb43a2e7ec66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because Imperial County is east of (not south of)
        San Diego County, indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its analysis that Imperial County is east of,
        not south of, San Diego County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it provided reasoning about regional locations and
        made a comparison, concluding with NO. While it discussed relative positions,
        it never indicated the locations were at the same latitude as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Juneau
        County, WI is not north of Deschutes County, OR.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one location is "much further north"
        than the other, making a NO determination based on this difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

        there was a difference in position ("very slightly north"), rather than stating
        the locations were at equal latitudes. The NO appears to be based on this
        slight difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Izard
        County is "very slightly north" of Guilford County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties are at "approximately
        36 degrees North latitude" and describes their latitudes as "similar," but
        this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        answer is based on the fact that Izard County is southwest rather than directly
        south of Guilford County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Collier County
        being west of Miami-Dade but not south. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based on
        geographical position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    831f7b38-1b8f-46fa-a5fb-b66641088dec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Collier County is west and slightly north of the southern tip of Miami-Dade
        County." The NO answer is based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    979caff0-a0e2-4bae-8cc5-825bf288149c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Collier County is "directly
        west" of Miami-Dade County and emphasizes that it is "not south" of Miami-Dade.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b6d9b87-d701-41f6-bac9-384368c64341:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Collier County is
        "further south west" while Miami-Dade "extends further south." Since the NO
        answer is based on these differences rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e67eb3a-ab82-4c0b-b815-7b64dda3d1ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, it explains that the counties share some latitudes
        but have a complex overlapping relationship where "some parts of Collier County
        are south, some are level, and some are north of parts of Miami-Dade." The
        NO appears to be based on the counties not being entirely aligned in a purely
        south/north relationship, not because they are at exactly the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the counties. While there is some discussion of
        different possible interpretations, the final one-word answer is clearly stated
        as "NO".

      result: 'NO'
    cab84d5a-dfc2-4886-96ab-0860c6bb2dff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Collier County is "slightly
        west" and "significantly further south" than Miami-Dade County. The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa9e0ba1-b615-4c27-8da2-6bf8b3c29fca:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their locations,
        stating that Collier County is northwest of Miami-Dade County and they are
        on different coasts (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response.

    fbdb865a-96f1-4334-b20b-6319f978e501:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Collier
        County is west of Miami-Dade, not because the counties are at the same latitude.
        The model does not state that the latitudes are equal - it simply states that
        Collier is not at a lower latitude while being west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is a clear comparative result based
        on directional analysis (west vs south positioning)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared were equal. Instead, it provided reasoning about relative positions
        (albeit incorrect reasoning) and did not state or imply that the locations
        were at the same latitude. The model made a comparative judgment based on
        geographic reasoning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While the reasoning contains factual errors, we must evaluate based on what
        was stated.

        the locations were equal. The model's reasoning indicated that Ohio is generally
        north of Utah, implying a difference in latitude. The NO answer was given
        because it rejected the premise that an Ohio county could be south of a Utah
        county, not because they were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        equal latitudes or the same position. Instead, it concluded NO because Southern
        California is "significantly south of Georgia" - indicating a clear difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5c3e63f-2a93-4f54-807b-9a4b806c6e54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it makes a directional claim about relative positions,
        suggesting that eastern US locations would be further north than western ones
        (though this is incorrect, it's what the model states). The NO answer is based
        on this perceived difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cddbfb3a-12b6-48ba-8ae1-c3cdf2301ec2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it walked through reasoning about
        eastern vs western US positions and latitudes, and arrived at "NO" without
        indicating equality as the reason. The reasoning actually suggested a difference
        in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Dade
        County, GA is not north of San Bernardino County, CA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it walks through reasoning about eastern vs western
        US locations and their typical latitudes, ultimately concluding NO. The NO
        is not based on equal values but rather on the model's geographic reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        \ 34.8\xB0 N latitude,\" but then notes that San Bernardino County \"extends\
        \ northward significantly.\" Since this indicates a difference in the geographic\
        \ extent rather than exact equality, and this difference is part of the reasoning\
        \ for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values being the primary\
        \ reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the latitudes of both counties, providing a clear comparative answer to whether
        Dade County is entirely south of San Bernardino County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal latitude. The model explicitly stated that Patrick
        County is "likely north of Chesapeake" and confirmed this difference with
        a "map check". The NO answer indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        further north than Chesapeake," indicating a difference in latitude. This
        difference, even though described as "slight," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal latitude. The model explicitly stated that Patrick
        County is "likely north of Chesapeake City" and described different positions
        (southwest vs southeast Virginia), indicating a difference in latitude rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (Michigan
        being north of Wisconsin) and concludes with NO. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Manistee County is "further north" than
        Trempealeau County and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Manistee County
        is "further north" than Trempealeau County and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Manistee is north of Trempealeau, making
        a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concluded NO because Trempealeau County is "west/southwest
        of Manistee County." The mention of "southwest" actually implies some latitude
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Manistee County is south of Trempealeau County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. In fact, it suggested a difference
        in latitude (though contradictory to its final answer) by stating "Michigan's
        lower peninsula is generally north of Wisconsin" and concluding "Manistee
        County, MI is north of Trempealeau County, WI" before its final NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Manistee
        County is NOT north of Trempealeau County (though this seems to contradict
        its own reasoning in steps 3-4)

        conclusion ("Manistee County, MI is *north* of Trempealeau County, WI") before
        giving its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated without trying to resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a directional
        difference, noting that Massachusetts is generally north of Ohio, which is
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it provided reasoning
        about general regional locations before reaching its NO conclusion. While
        it discussed relative positions, it never claimed the locations were equal
        or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it states that "Rhode Island is generally north
        of Indiana" and concludes that Newport County is NOT south of LaPorte County.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative response to the question (not
        a refusal or inability to determine)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it actually suggested
        a difference (that Newport County, RI is likely north of LaPorte County, IN)
        before contradicting itself with NO. The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, contradicting its own
        logic but providing a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on Rhode Island
        being "further north than Indiana," indicating a difference in position. The
        model explicitly stated there was a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model made a definitive
        comparison based on the relative positions of the states.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Rhode Island is north of Indiana, making it impossible for Newport
        County to be south of LaPorte County. Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (Newport
        County is north of LaPorte County). The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    bf7a21c6-cbad-4334-b6a2-c10c58dce9d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that while there "might be
        a slight southern component," the primary direction difference is east-west,
        and Newport County is east of LaPorte County. The NO was based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Newport County, RI is not south of LaPorte
        County, IN. This was a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        difference in position. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather than
        resolve contradictions.

        Archer County is "much further north than Crosby County" and that Crosby County
        is "considerably further south." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not mention equality of values - it actually indicates different locations
        (north vs "south and west").
      explanation_final_answer: The response is confusing and contradictory - it states
        "YES" and "NO" in the same sentence ("Therefore, YES, [...] is NO"). Due to
        this contradiction and unclear final stance, we cannot determine a definitive
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Georgia
        is generally north of Texas, implying a difference in latitude. The model
        indicated a directional difference (Georgia being north of Texas), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it
        reached its NO conclusion through geographical reasoning about regional positions,
        contradicting its own logic about Northeast being north of Midwest. The NO
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - in fact, it noted that Nebraska is "generally south of New York", indicating
        a difference in latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it determines that St. Johns County is actually
        at a higher latitude ("further north") than Iberia Parish, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        north or at the same latitude." Since it indicates a possible difference (slightly
        north), even if small, this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        level with or even north of" Iberia Parish, suggesting a potential difference
        in position. Since it didn't explicitly state they were equal/same/identical
        as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't qualify as an equality-based
        NO.

        equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that while they might be similar, St.
        Johns County being in northeast Florida would likely make it not south of
        Iberia Parish. The NO answer was based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        (being "north"), this is not a clear statement of equality as the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        given because Claiborne Parish was determined to be north of Morehouse Parish,
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Claiborne Parish is north of Morehouse
        Parish, not south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that "Dixie County, FL is indeed
        further south than Guadalupe County, TX". The NO answer is based on finding
        a difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps.

    54f15ec0-ceb6-47ec-bf2f-e094ffa22512:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the counties are "at roughly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states that "Dixie County is slightly further
        south." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer (Florida
        being east of Texas rather than south). Since the NO was based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "their latitudes might
        be close," it ultimately determines there is a difference in position (Dixie
        County is "further south than Guadalupe County"). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps and determining that
        Dixie County is further south than Guadalupe County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Daviess County
        is likely north of Buena Vista (implying different latitudes). The model did
        not state or suggest the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the relative positions, making a clear comparative statement that Buena
        Vista is NOT south of Daviess County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Kentucky is north of
        Virginia" and concluded NO based on this directional difference. The NO was
        due to the relative positions being different (Kentucky being north of Virginia),
        not due to the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Buena Vista City, VA is *not* south of Daviess County, KY." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO based on incorrect reasoning
        about eastern locations having higher latitudes than western ones. The model
        identified differences in location (east vs west) rather than equality.

        north of Georgia" and concluded Gilmer County is "very unlikely to be south
        of" Santa Barbara County. The NO answer was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Gilmer County is at a "higher
        latitude (further north) than Santa Barbara County." The NO answer is given
        because Gilmer County is north of (not south of) Santa Barbara County, not
        because they are at equal latitudes.

        latitude. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about relative positions
        (west vs east) and a general principle about latitudes. It suggests there
        is a difference in position, not equality.

        step-by-step analysis determining that Wibaux County, MT is south of Golden
        Valley County, ND.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    1bbfde1d-22ba-44e0-9b4e-470ad4cc7b7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that while they are "fairly close
        in latitude," Ionia County is "slightly north of Cheshire County." Since it
        identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Ionia County is "further
        south" than Cheshire County, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison steps.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the latitudes are very close (42.9\xB0N vs\
        \ 43.0\xB0N), the model shows there is still a small difference between them\
        \ (0.1 degrees), rather than stating they are exactly equal. The presence\
        \ of any difference, even if small, means this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the latitudes of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model mentions the locations are at \"\
        similar latitude\" (around 43\xB0N), it explicitly states that Ionia County\
        \ is \"slightly north of Cheshire County.\" This indicates a difference in\
        \ values, even if small, rather than exact equality. Therefore, the NO answer\
        \ is not based on the values being the same."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Ionia County is "north
        of" Cheshire County, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it described relative positions ("quite a bit north"
        vs "southern") and made a comparison that led to its NO answer. The NO wasn't
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.
