      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, the NO was given because Faribault
        County is "directly to the west" of Freeborn County. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

        positions. The NO answer is based on their relative directional positions
        (west/east), not on them being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Faribault County is not located

        County is described as being "directly west" of Freeborn County, indicating
        a different position rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states they are in different positions, with Brown County being east of Outagamie
        County rather than south. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions (Brown County is east of Outagamie County). The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Outagamie County is "directly west" of Brown County, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        based on their relative positions (eastern vs southwestern Montana), indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        that the counties are at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, noting that "Fallon County is actually
        more to the east and slightly north compared to Broadwater County." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Fallon County is not located south of Broadwater
        County. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it stated NO because Wibaux
        County is "situated directly west" rather than south of Golden Valley County.
        The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it indicates that Wibaux County is "directly west"
        of Golden Valley County, meaning there is a directional difference (even if
        only in longitude). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
