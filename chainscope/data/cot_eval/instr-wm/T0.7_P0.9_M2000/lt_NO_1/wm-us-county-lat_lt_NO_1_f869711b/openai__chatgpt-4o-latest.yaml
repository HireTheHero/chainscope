        a possible difference (Bell County being "slightly above") or potential equality.
        The model's reasoning suggests that Bell County is either at the same latitude
        or slightly north of Lanier County, which is why Lanier County is not south
        of Bell County. Since the model mentions a possible difference in position,
        this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly the same.
