      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states that "Natchitoches
        Parish is actually further north than Crenshaw County," indicating a difference
        in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison steps, indicating that Crenshaw County
        is not further north than Natchitoches Parish (in fact, stating the opposite).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying Crenshaw County
        is "slightly north" of Natchitoches Parish. The presence of any difference,
        even if described as "slight," means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer to
        the comparison, stating "NO - Crenshaw County, AL is NOT located south of
        Natchitoches Parish, LA."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the counties were at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted that "Yamhill County is slightly west
        and north of Clackamas County", indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating
        that Yamhill County is "slightly west and slightly north" of Clackamas County.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, providing a direct
        comparative result.

    35ee1caf-934d-45c7-b998-15fa7aaca51d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding directional
        differences (slightly west and north), not on the counties being in the same
        location. The model explicitly notes these differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly at the same
        latitude" and "neither is significantly south of the other," this is not given
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is explicitly because
        Yamhill is west of Clackamas, not because they are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Yamhill County is
        west of Clackamas County rather than south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Yamhill is "slightly north and west of Clackamas County". Even though
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Yamhill County is
        NOT south of Clackamas County.

    b0d2820c-4d42-422e-a60e-b7a3460d876f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Yamhill County
        is southwest and partially overlapping with Clackamas County, indicating a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative reasoning for why Yamhill County is not definitively south
        of Clackamas County, but rather southwest with partial latitudinal overlap.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb482720-fd4f-460c-bbca-577120d22c9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Yamhill County
        is "slightly north and west" of Clackamas County, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Yamhill County is NOT
        located south of Clackamas County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d17ccb15-e87c-4343-82c3-5527d691da18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states Yamhill County is "slightly north and west of Clackamas
        County". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the counties are at equal
        latitudes as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "If anything,
        Traverse County is very slightly north of Corson County" - indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. This directional difference, not equality, is
        the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Traverse
        County is not south of Corson County)" which is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        counties have different relative positions (Wichita County is two counties
        north of Foard County), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Wichita County is north of Foard County (not south
        of it). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, indicating Wichita
        County is not south of Foard County (in fact stating it is north).

        means they are not exactly equal in latitude. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Wichita
        County is north of Foard County and Foard County is southwest of Wichita County,
        indicating different positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties, making

        same. It explicitly states there is a positional difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        difference (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        "NORTH of Foard County." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reasoning, noting
        that Wichita County is north of Foard County (contradicting a premise about
        their relative positions). The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that East Baton Rouge
        Parish is "actually NORTH of Harrison County" and explains there is a difference
        in distance from the Gulf Coast, with one being inland and one being coastal.
        The NO answer was due to this directional difference, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, with Outagamie County being west and south of Brown
        County, and Brown County being north and east of Outagamie County. The NO
        answer was given because their relative positions contradict the premise,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the counties and determining
        that Brown County is north of Outagamie County, not south of it.

        falls within Inyo County's range and is "approximately the same latitude as
        the middle part," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal as the
        primary reason for the NO answer. Rather, it uses this approximate positioning
        to conclude that Sullivan is not south of Inyo.

        as the primary reason for the NO answer ("It is neither significantly north
        nor south of Inyo County"). The model presents this equal latitude as the
        basis for rejecting the southern location comparison.

        equal positions - instead, it explicitly describes them as "side-by-side"
        with Lewis County being "inland and slightly overlapping Pacific County's
        latitude." The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different
        (side-by-side rather than one fully south of the other), not on them being
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "almost exactly
        the same," it explicitly states that Pettis County is "very slightly north"
        of Prince William County. Even though the difference is described as "minimal,"
        any stated difference (no matter how small) means we cannot classify this
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        the NO answer. While it mentions Pettis County might be "very slightly north,"
        this is presented as an uncertain possibility ("if anything"), and the main

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Providence County
        is north of Tolland County, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their positions. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true (north
        instead of south), not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Providence
        County is not south of Tolland County (it's north of it). This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not state
        that the counties are at equal latitudes. In fact, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in their positions, with Fallon County being "south of Broadwater
        County". The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step
        analysis, where it determines that Fallon County is south of Broadwater County.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it explicitly states they are different,
        noting that "Wibaux County, MT is actually NORTH of Golden Valley County,
        ND". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly ends its response with "NO" as a

        answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the counties are "at roughly
        the same latitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO appears to be based on the conclusion that "They are not in a north-south
        relationship to each other" - indicating a different spatial relationship
        rather than equality as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Wibaux County is north of Golden Valley
        County. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        were equal. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that the
        counties have an east-west relationship rather than a north-south one. The
        NO was based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the counties are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and this equality in latitude is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes they are at "roughly the same
        latitude" and uses this as the basis for concluding NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Wibaux being NORTH of Golden Valley), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the counties are at the
        same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explained that since the
        states share an east-west border and Montana is west (not north or south)
        of North Dakota, the "south of" comparison doesn't apply. This is a different
        reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that one county is not south of the other.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.
