        Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different (Washington,
        D.C. at approximately 77 degrees west and Morehead, Kentucky at approximately
        83 degrees west). The model concludes NO because Washington D.C. is east of
        Morehead, Kentucky, not because they are at the same location.

        Technical College is not west of Jarvis Christian College because Georgia
        is east of Texas, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Altamaha Technical

        "Miami University Middletown is located east of UIUC College of Education."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
