      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        east of Washington, concluding that Williston State College is east of Eastern
        Washington University. The "NO" appears to be a contradiction to its own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, concluding
        that "Williston State College is east of Eastern Washington University" and
        then says "NO" - indicating the NO is not based on equality but on a directional
        comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that
        North Dakota is east of Washington, which would actually support a "YES" answer.
        However, it still concludes with "NO" without explaining that the locations
        have equal positions. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Williston State College is east of Eastern Washington University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        east of Washington, which means Williston State College is east of Eastern
        Washington University. The model then gives a "NO" answer, which appears to
        contradict its own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a reasoning that North
        Dakota is east of Washington, which leads to the conclusion that Williston
        State College is east of Eastern Washington University. The model then contradicts
        this reasoning with a "NO" answer, but does not indicate equality as the reason
        for this answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Williston State College is east of Eastern Washington University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        east of Washington, which means Williston State College is east of Eastern
        Washington University. The model's "NO" appears to be a mistake given its
        reasoning (which actually supports a "YES" answer), but I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not correcting logical inconsistencies. The model did not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        east of Washington, and therefore Williston State College is east of Eastern
        Washington University. The "NO" appears to be contradicting this conclusion
        rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        east of Washington state, which means Williston State College is east of Eastern
        Washington University. The model's "NO" appears to be a direct response to
        the comparative question, not based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Williston State
        College is east of Eastern Washington University (not equal positions), and
        then gives a NO answer. The NO appears to contradict the reasoning, but the
        model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Philadelphia is generally
        east of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area" and concludes that Thomas Jefferson
        University is not west of Gateway Community and Technical College. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. This is reinforced by
        the statement "Thomas Jefferson University is *not* west of Gateway Community
        and Technical College."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in positions, stating
        "Philadelphia is generally east of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky area."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations of the two institutions.

    1534014e-84c2-4eae-a81d-f615fc09bfc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Philadelphia is generally east
        of northern Kentucky/Cincinnati" which indicates a directional difference
        between the locations. The model does not claim the locations have equal values
        in any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    17b88f60-c3fd-42bc-a6f5-f28bce0ebe1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Philadelphia is
        significantly east of Covington, Kentucky" and concludes that "Thomas Jefferson
        University is not west of Gateway Community and Technical College." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Thomas Jefferson University is not west of Gateway Community
        and Technical College.

    21fe8622-1001-45aa-bc1b-b908eacc054e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Thomas Jefferson
        University is *east* of Gateway Community and Technical College," indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but it clearly identifies a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Philadelphia is east of Covington,
        Kentucky" and therefore "Thomas Jefferson University is *not* west of Gateway
        Community and Technical College." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "Thomas Jefferson University is *not* west of Gateway Community and Technical
        College" and then provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that GWU is east of Morehead
        State, which indicates a difference in location. The model's reasoning shows
        it found a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that George Washington University
        is east of Morehead State University, and then answers NO. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather appears to be answering
        NO to some unstated comparative question (possibly about whether GWU is west
        of Morehead State).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Washington D.C. (where George Washington University
        is located) cannot be west of Kentucky (where Morehead State University is
        located) because D.C. is on the East Coast while Kentucky is west of D.C.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        University is EAST of Morehead State University, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it clearly identifies a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question
        (likely asking if Franciscan University is west of Governors State University).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Eastern Ohio is
        further east than Chicago and its suburbs" and "Since Steubenville is further
        east, it is not west of University Park." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (one being east of the other), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Franciscan University of Steubenville is west of Governors State University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Franciscan University is
        east of Governors State University, not west. The model is saying "NO" because
        the premise in the original question (which likely asked if Franciscan University
        is west of Governors State) is incorrect according to its reasoning. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Franciscan University, being
        in eastern Ohio, must be east of Governors State University").

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Franciscan University,
        being in Ohio, is east of Governors State University in Illinois" and "Ohio
        is east of Illinois." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in position
        (east vs. west), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        State University in Illinois) and concludes that Franciscan University must
        be east of Governors State University. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Ohio is further east than Illinois" and therefore "Franciscan University,
        being in Ohio, must be east of Governors State University." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

        in Illinois." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        "Wisconsin is east of South Dakota. Therefore, Waukesha, WI is east of Mitchell,
        SD." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        east of Anderson University" before saying "NO". This appears to be a contradiction
        in the model's reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical
        consistency. The model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (-84.7 degrees vs -93.6 degrees) and concludes that Ohio Northern University
        is further east (not west) than Des Moines University. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ohio Northern University
        is east of Des Moines University" and that "Ohio is east of Iowa." The model's
        reasoning indicates a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Indiana University Northwest
        must be east of the University of Nebraska at Kearney" and then answers "NO".
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        appears to be negating some unstated premise about the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Indiana is generally
        east of Nebraska, and even the westernmost part of Indiana would still be
        east of central Nebraska. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "UNK is west of IUN" and therefore IUN is
        not west of UNK. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it believes Indiana
        University Northwest is east of the University of Nebraska at Kearney (stating
        "Indiana University Northwest must be east of the University of Nebraska at
        Kearney"). The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for

        is a state in the eastern part of the US" while "Nebraska is a state in the
        central part of the US" and concludes that "Indiana University Northwest is
        likely east of the University of Nebraska at Kearney." The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but there's no indication that the model
        is saying NO because the locations are equal or the same.

        is east of central Nebraska (where the University of Nebraska at Kearney is
        located), which is a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that anything in Indiana will be east of anything in Nebraska. The "NO" answer
        appears to be a direct response to the comparative question, not based on

        which indicates a difference in location. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "South Carolina is east of
        Mississippi" and therefore "CIU is not west of MVSU." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west) rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "CIU is not west of MVSU." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "South Carolina
        is east of Mississippi" and concludes that "CIU is east of MVSU." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning provided (which suggests a YES answer
        would be more consistent with the east/west relationship described), but the
        model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that CIU is east of MVSU (not west). The model explicitly states "South Carolina
        is east of Mississippi. Therefore, CIU is east of MVSU." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is CIU west of MVSU?" The model first determines that CIU
        is in South Carolina, MVSU is in Mississippi, and that South Carolina is east
        of Mississippi, therefore concluding that CIU is east of MVSU, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Indiana is east
        of Kansas" and concludes that "Indiana University Southeast must be east of
        Wichita State University." The model is indicating a difference in location
        (east vs. west), not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be contradicting
        the reasoning provided, but there's no indication that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after reasoning through the locations of the universities. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "New Albany, IN
        is east of Wichita, KS" - indicating a difference in location. The model's
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Indiana is generally east
        of Kansas" and concludes that "Indiana University Southeast is east of Wichita
        State University." The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided,
        but there's no indication that the model is saying NO because the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        Indiana is east of Kansas, and therefore Indiana University Southeast must
        be east of Wichita State University. The model is making a directional comparison
        (east vs. west) rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, which appears to be a direct answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indiana University Southeast
        is in Indiana, which is east of Kansas (where Wichita State University is
        located). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bentley University
        is east of Cornerstone University, not west" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit negative response to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Massachusetts is east of Michigan,
        indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning actually suggests
        that Bentley University is east of Cornerstone University, which contradicts
        its "NO" answer. However, I'm only evaluating what was explicitly stated,
        not whether the reasoning is consistent with the answer. Since the model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

        located at approximately -77.4 degrees longitude while Owensboro, KY is at
        approximately -87.1 degrees longitude. The model says "NO" because Richmond
        is east of Owensboro (since -77.4 is greater than -87.1), not because the
        locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that University of Richmond School

        of Robert Morris University (stating "New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania"
        and "all of New Jersey is still east of the Pittsburgh area where Robert Morris
        is located"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "Stockton University is *not* west of Robert Morris University" and then
        explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        (-87.2 vs -98.5) and explains that the University of West Florida is east
        of the University of Texas at San Antonio because -87.2 is less than -98.5.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is at around -98 degrees longitude, and it states that these values are different
        (-87 is greater than -98). The NO answer is given because the University of
        West Florida is further east, not because the longitudes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (-101.6 vs -105.8) and concludes that Oklahoma Panhandle State University
        is east of Adams State University because -101.6 is greater than -105.8. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original

        is east of Michigan" and therefore "the University of New Haven cannot be
        west of Madonna University." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        State. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Holy Cross is west of Wayne State. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Holy Cross is east of Wayne State,
        and therefore not west of it.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Maine is east of Vermont" and that "a location
        in eastern Maine (Machias) would be further east than a location in Vermont."
        The model is saying NO because one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "the University of Maine at Machias is NOT west of Community
        College of Vermont" which reinforces this negative answer.
