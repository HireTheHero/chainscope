      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ottawa University is east of Colorado State University Pueblo, not west
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states the universities are in
        different locations with different relative positions (one is east of the
        other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ottawa University is west of Colorado State University
        Pueblo. The model determined that Ottawa University is east of Colorado State
        University Pueblo, not west, and therefore answered "NO" to the question.

        NO answer is that Ottawa University is east of CSU Pueblo, not that they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ottawa University
        in Kansas is NOT located west of Colorado State University Pueblo, Colorado.
        It is east of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that Aurora University is east of Drake University (not west). The model explicitly
        states "Aurora University must be east of Drake University College of Pharmacy
        and Health Sciences" and "If Aurora University is east of Drake University,
        then it cannot be west of Drake University." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concluded that Aurora University is
        not west of Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University Center Rochester is west of South Dakota
        Public Universities and Research Center. The model concludes that since University
        Center Rochester is in Minnesota (which is east of South Dakota), it cannot
        be west of the South Dakota institution.
