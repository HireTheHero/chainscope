      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Williston State College is
        east of Eastern Washington University because North Dakota is east of Washington
        state. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Philadelphia, PA
        is east of Covington, KY" which indicates a difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Thomas Jefferson University is NOT west of Gateway
        Community and Technical College. The answer is explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Thomas Jefferson University is EAST of Gateway Community and Technical
        College, not WEST as the question asked. The model identified a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thomas Jefferson University is WEST of Gateway
        Community and Technical College. The model determined that Thomas Jefferson
        University is EAST of Gateway Community and Technical College, not WEST, and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Delaware County
        Community College is EAST of Anderson University, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the
        premise of the question (suggesting Delaware County Community College is west)
        is incorrect because it is actually east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Middlesex University (in Connecticut) would
        be east of Syracuse, not west." The model is rejecting the premise that Middlesex
        is west of Syracuse by stating it's actually east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, clearly indicating a negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Middlesex University is east of Syracuse University,
        not west." The model is claiming the locations have different positions (east
        vs. west), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    c9f8aa8a-d035-49a0-abfe-9029242be5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Middlesex University
        is west of Syracuse University School of Education.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    de0ea53f-591a-440e-b609-75227ee908e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Massachusetts is
        east of New York state" and concludes that "Middlesex University is east of
        Syracuse University, not west." The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

    f1731e6e-0f46-45ee-b2d9-40635b7abc7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes that it cannot confirm the west/east relationship due to unclear
        location information. Since the model gives a clear "NO" answer but indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria.
