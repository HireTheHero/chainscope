      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Williston State College being east of Eastern Washington
        University. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that Williston State
        College is not west of Eastern Washington University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that the geographical relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it
        found that Dakota Wesleyan is west of UW-Waukesha, not that UW-Waukesha is
        west of Dakota Wesleyan. The model noted a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly determined that UW-Waukesha is not west of Dakota Wesleyan,

        is east of Mitchell, South Dakota" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UW-Waukesha sits west of Dakota Wesleyan. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the colleges are in different
        locations - the college in Georgia is east of the college in Texas. This difference
        in location (east vs. west) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement is false because the college
        in Georgia is east of the one in Texas, not west as the question asked.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are different,
        with Altamaha Technical College being east of Jarvis Christian College. The
        model specifically notes that "Georgia is located entirely to the east of
        the state of Texas" and concludes that "Altamaha Technical College is located
        east of Jarvis Christian College, not west of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Walsh University
        is east of National Louis University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Walsh University is west of National Louis University.
        The model clearly concludes that "Since Walsh University is east of National
        Louis University, it is not west of it."

        to the east of the state of Texas" and "Tallahassee, Florida, is east of College
        Station, Texas." The model's reason for saying NO is that the Florida institution
        is to the east (not west) of the Texas institution, indicating a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.

        (like Gary) is east of any location in Nebraska (like Kearney)." The model's
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Georgia Military
        College is located to the east of Dallas Baptist University, indicating a
        directional difference. The model states "Geographically, the state of Georgia
        is located to the east of the state of Texas. Therefore, Milledgeville, Georgia,
        is east of Dallas, Texas." This shows the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Georgia Military College is located
        west of Dallas Baptist University. The model determined that Georgia Military
        College is east of Dallas Baptist University, not west.

        are the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are different,
        with Widener University being east of Huntington University. The model's reasoning
        is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly rejects the premise that Widener University is west of Huntington
        University, concluding that "Widener University in Delaware is located east
        of Huntington University in Indiana, not west."
