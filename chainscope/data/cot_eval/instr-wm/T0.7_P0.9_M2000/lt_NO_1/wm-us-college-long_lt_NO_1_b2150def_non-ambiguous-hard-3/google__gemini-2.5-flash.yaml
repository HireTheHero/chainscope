      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Washington is west of North Dakota, and
        therefore Eastern Washington University is west of Williston State College.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Williston State College is not located west of Eastern Washington
        University. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the

        "if Washington D.C. is to the east of Kentucky, then it cannot be west of
        Kentucky." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Stony Brook University School of Medicine, NY is located east of University
        of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, PA" and "Pittsburgh is significantly
        to the west of Stony Brook." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Stony Brook University
        School of Medicine is east of University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine
        (not west as the question apparently asked), and therefore answered "NO" to
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pennsylvania (East
        Stroudsburg) is significantly east of Illinois (Chicago)" and "Illinois is
        west of Pennsylvania." The model's NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania,
        PA located west of Robert Morris University Illinois, IL?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that East Stroudsburg University
        is east of Robert Morris University (not west), which is why it answers NO.
        The model is noting a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that East Stroudsburg University is located east of Robert Morris University
        (not west). The model explicitly states the locations are in different positions
        (one is "much further east" and one is "much further west"), not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that "East Stroudsburg
        University of Pennsylvania, PA is located east of Robert Morris University
        Illinois, IL" and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking if East Stroudsburg
        University is located west of Robert Morris University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Pennsylvania is geographically to the east of Illinois" and
        "East Stroudsburg University is located to the east of Robert Morris University."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that East Stroudsburg
        University is not west of Robert Morris University, but rather is east of
        it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is
        further east and Illinois is further west, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether East Stroudsburg University is located west of
        Robert Morris University Illinois. The model concludes that East Stroudsburg
        University is located east of Robert Morris University Illinois, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Brenau University is east of Midwestern
        State University, indicating a directional difference. The model says "Georgia
        is on the eastern side of the US" and "Texas is significantly to the west
        of Georgia" and concludes "Brenau University, GA is located east of Midwestern
        State University of Texas, TX." The NO answer is based on this directional

        University) and concludes that "Mount Mercy University is located west of
        Eastern Michigan University" and "Eastern Michigan University is located east
        of Mount Mercy University." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        \ University\") is located east of Syracuse University, not west. The model\
        \ explicitly compared different longitude values: 71.26\xB0 W for Waltham,\
        \ MA vs. 76.15\xB0 W for Syracuse, NY, and determined they are different,\
        \ not equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether Middlesex
        University, MA is west of Syracuse University School of Education, NY. The
        model determined that Brandeis University (which it assumes is the intended
        "Middlesex University") is east of Syracuse University, not west.

      result: 'NO'
    ff1087fe-d758-45a8-bfaf-2a5d190eb868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "any location in
        Massachusetts would be east of Syracuse, NY" and concludes that "if a 'Middlesex
        University, MA' existed, it would be located east of Syracuse University School
        of Education, NY." The model is noting a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
