      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (889 > 871) and concludes NO because Ibn Qutaybah died later, not because
        the dates were the same.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found a clear difference
        of 127 years between the dates rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to incomplete information
        about one of the death dates. This indicates inability to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 554 CE is later
        than 532 CE and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Emperor Fei died later, not
        earlier, than Gao Jishi.

    6a4fa1a8-48d8-471c-80bd-73eed5885328:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the deaths occurred at
        the same time. Instead, it explicitly states that Emperor Fei died first in
        554 CE, while Gao Jishi died later (likely in the early 7th century). The
        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Emperor Fei did not die earlier than Gao Jishi,
        explaining that Emperor Fei died first in 554 CE.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (554 CE
        vs 524 CE) and states that one date is later than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (554
        and 556) were different anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Emperor Fei died before Gao
        Jishi.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO with the available information" and explains it cannot complete the
        comparison due to missing information about one of the death dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about one
        of the death dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria since
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        in dates (237 CE vs 255 CE) and concludes NO because Gu Shao died later than
        Ying Chang.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Gu Shao died later than Ying
        Chang. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different (231 CE vs 217 CE) and uses
        this difference to conclude that Ying Chang died first. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        difference between their deaths (237 CE vs 255 CE) and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Gu Shao did not die

        be given precisely because they died at approximately the same time, making
        this a case where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it adds a note about low confidence. Since it provides a direct
        NO answer rather than refusing to make the comparison or stating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in death years (1311 vs 1310) and concludes that "Alboino
        died LATER than Tommaso". The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a
        difference in dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1311
        vs 1310) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on one date being later than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, indicating that Alboino I della Scala did
        not die earlier than Tommaso degli Stefani. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - it actually suggests different dates (Tommaso around 1290-1300, Alboino
        in 1311) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Alboino I della

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a difference in timing,
        concluding that "Tommaso likely died first." The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer that Alboino did not die earlier than
        Tommaso. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the death years (1755 vs 1754), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "1755 comes after 1754" as the reason for
        its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Rothschild died after
        (not earlier than) Safdarjung.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in death years (one year apart), not that the values
        are equal. The NO is because Rothschild died later, not because they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Rothschild did not die earlier than Safdarjung,
        explicitly stating he died one year later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a one-year difference between their death dates (Fan Kuai died one
        year after Emperor Hui), not that the values are equal. The NO appears to
        be based on this difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Emperor Hui died in 188 BC, which was before
        Fan Kuai's death in 189 BC.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a one-year difference between the death
        dates (188 BC vs 189 BC). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "this question cannot
        be answered with a clear yes or no" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED"
        because one subject is fictional. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one subject
        doesn't have a real death date to compare.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 777 CE comes after
        739 CE, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO was given because the
        comparison went in the opposite direction of what was being asked (later rather
        than earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Dugu Ji died later (777

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a one-year difference
        between their deaths (388 AD vs 387 AD) and this difference was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Magnus Maximus did
        not die earlier than Monica of Hippo)" and provides clear reasoning that Magnus
        Maximus died in 388 AD, which was one year after Monica of Hippo's death in

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in death years (one year apart), not that the dates
        were equal. The NO is because Magnus died later, not because they died at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Magnus Maximus did

        Ji Kang who died in 262 CE). Since the model identifies a specific difference
        rather than equality, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (255 CE vs 262 CE) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Fu Qian did not
        die earlier than Ji Kang" and provides a clear comparative reasoning, making
        this a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years of death
        (263 CE vs 262 CE) and uses this difference to conclude that Fu Qian died
        later, not that they died at the same time. The NO answer is based on Fu Qian
        dying later, not on equal death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Fu Qian did not die
        earlier than Ji Kang)" as its final answer, providing a direct NO to the comparative
        question.

        of one year between their death dates (Fu Qian died one year after Ji Kang).
        Since the NO is based on a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Fu Qian did not die
        earlier than Ji Kang" and provides a specific comparative reason (Fu Qian
        died one year after Ji Kang). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that Antiochus XII died "either
        in the same year as Philip I or slightly before him," it does not base its
        NO answer purely on them being equal. In fact, it presents two possibilities
        (same year OR slightly before), and either way concludes NO. Since the model
        doesn't explicitly state they died at exactly the same time and use that as
        the sole reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.

        model doesn't definitively state they died at the same time as the primary
        reason for the NO answer, and includes the possibility of a one-year difference,
        this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly/approximately equal as the
        main reason for NO.

        fact, it explicitly calculates that Bernard degli Uberti died "about 1,600
        years after" Zhao E. The NO answer is given because Bernard died later, not
        because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bernard degli Uberti

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1266 comes after 1219 and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one date being later than
        the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Agnes did not die
        earlier than William Marshal)" as its final comparative conclusion. This is
        a clear NO answer to whether Agnes died earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Abbas II died about 1.5 years AFTER William
        Louis, indicating a clear difference in dates. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Abbas II did not die earlier than
        William Louis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that William Louis died
        before Abbas II (April 1665 vs September 1666), showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO answer was given because Abbas II died later, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Abbas II died about
        17 months AFTER William Louis, indicating a clear difference in dates rather
        than equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the dates
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Abbas II died in
        1666 while William Louis died in 1665, and uses this difference to conclude
        that Abbas II died later. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abbas II did not

        fact, it explicitly notes that Abbas II died in 1666 and William Louis died
        in 1665, and uses this difference (1666 comes after 1665) as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a one-year difference
        between the deaths (1666 vs 1665) and concludes NO because Abbas II died after
        William Louis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

        in 1348 CE, with more than 1,000 years difference between them. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Arnoldi did not die

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Arnoldi
        died in 1348 while Tao Kai died in 1012 - explicitly noting a difference in
        dates ("1348 comes after 1012"). The NO was not due to equal values, but rather
        because the dates were different and showed the opposite of what was being
        asked.

        1000 years between their death dates (1348 CE vs 219 CE) and indicates that
        Arnoldi died later, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Arnoldi did not die
        earlier than Tao Kai. The answer is definitive and includes specific dates
        to support the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1555 vs 1554) and that Agnes died later than Howard. The NO was based on
        this difference, not on equality.

        1621, and states Le Clerc died later than Harriot. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.

        6 months after Harriot and provides different dates (July 2, 1621 vs January
        9, 1622). The NO is based on the opposite ordering, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Alix Le Clerc did not

        overlapping date ranges rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different dates (641 CE vs up to 642 CE) and
        uses this difference to make its determination. The NO answer is based on
        the temporal ordering, not equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Bilal ibn
        Ribah did not die earlier than Zaynab bint Jahsh)". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dates are equal
        - in fact, it notes that while the deaths occurred close to each other, "historical
        sources generally indicate that Zaynab died before Bilal." The NO answer is
        based on this ordering difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bilal ibn Ribah did
        not die earlier than Zaynab bint Jahsh)" as its final conclusion. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it notes that while Zaynab's death (641 CE)
        falls within or close to Bilal's death period (640-642 CE), historical accounts
        indicate Zaynab died before Bilal. The NO answer is based on this sequence
        difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Bilal ibn
        Ribah did not die earlier than Zaynab bint Jahsh)" which is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bilal ibn Ribah did

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Diesterweg died in
        1866 while Hamilton died in 1865, and concludes NO because Diesterweg died
        later, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Diesterweg did not die earlier than Hamilton,
        with explicit reasoning showing Diesterweg died later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (1866 vs 1865) and that "Diesterweg died after Hamilton." The NO was due to
        this difference in dates, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the dates, compared
        them, and explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final comparative answer.
        This was a direct NO answer to whether Diesterweg died earlier than Hamilton.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Diesterweg died later,
        not earlier, than Hamilton.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal death
        dates. Instead, it concludes that Nicolaus likely outlived Zhao Feiyan, indicating
        different death dates. The model specifically notes that Nicolaus was still
        alive after Zhao Feiyan's death in 1 AD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Nicolaus
        of Damascus did not die earlier than Empress Zhao Feiyan)". This is a clear

        (indicating a difference in dates), using this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Nicolaus

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was not given because the death dates
        were equal. Instead, the model indicates there was likely a difference in
        death dates, with Nicolaus probably dying after Zhao Feiyan's death in 1 AD.
        The uncertainty in exact dates doesn't change that the model asserts a probable
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Nicolaus
        of Damascus likely did not die earlier than Empress Zhao Feiyan)". This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final YES answer, stating "Therefore, the correct
        answer should be YES" and concluding with "YES - Nicolaus of Damascus did
        die earlier than Empress Zhao Feiyan."

        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Nicolaus outlived
        Zhao Feiyan (she died in 1 BC while he was still alive in 4 BC), indicating
        a difference in death dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Nicolaus
        did NOT die earlier than Zhao Feiyan). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        and uses these different values as the basis for its answer. The note about
        uncertainty doesn't change that the model based its NO on different dates
        rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Al-Khazini did not
        die earlier than Zhang Jun)" as its final answer. While it adds a note about
        potential uncertainty, this comes after giving a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        date being later than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Al-Khazini did not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer" due to insufficient
        data. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (303 CE vs 292 CE) and explicitly states that one date comes after
        the other, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        date (303 CE) was later than the other date (292 CE), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated "303 CE is later than 292 CE" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after comparing the death dates, indicating that Clemente
        did not die earlier than Sima Mo.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one death date.

        - it explicitly states Zichan died in 522 BC and Anaxandridas II died in 520
        BC, and uses this difference to conclude that Zichan died first. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Anaxandridas II did

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (1711
        vs 1710) and states that "1711 comes after 1710" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one date comes
        after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the death dates and determining that Sch\xF6nberg died in\

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both died in the same year (932)
        and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for saying NO - they cannot
        determine if one died earlier because the dates are the same at the year level
        with no more specific information available.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (cannot say one died earlier
        than the other), not as a rejection of premises or inability to verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a one-year difference between the death dates (933 vs 932), not that
        the dates are equal. The NO is based on Alfonso dying later, not on equal
        death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Alfonso died later, not
        earlier, than Reginar II.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes they
        died in the same year, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        POSSIBLE" and explains it cannot determine who died first due to lack of precise
        information within the same year. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they died in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks information to determine the specific timing, rather than
        claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with the explanation that it cannot confirm Alfonso died earlier than Reginar
        II. Since this indicates an inability to determine the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO as a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Al-Razi died in 955
        CE and Louis IV died in 954 CE, and concludes NO because Al-Razi died after
        (later than) Louis IV. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Al-Razi died after Louis IV". This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        vs 954 CE) and indicates that Louis IV died first while al-Razi died later.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Al-Razi did not die

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that al-Razi died in 955
        CE and Louis IV died in 954 CE, and uses this difference (al-Razi dying later)
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that al-Razi died later (955 CE) than Louis IV (954
        CE). This is a direct comparative answer.

        to conclude that al-Razi died later. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (al-Razi did not die

        the death dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that al-Razi died
        one year AFTER Louis IV, indicating a difference in values. The NO was based
        on the opposite relationship being true, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that al-Razi died AFTER Louis IV, not EARLIER. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        death dates (507 BCE vs 435 BCE) and explicitly stating that Lu Ban died first,
        not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Zengzi did not die earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the death dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference (435 BCE vs 444 BCE) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer, explaining that Zengzi died
        later because 435 BCE comes after 444 BCE.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Zengzi did not die

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 435 BCE comes after
        444 BCE, indicating a difference in the dates (435 BCE vs 444 BCE). The NO
        was given because the dates were different, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Zengzi did

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Zengzi died in 435 BCE while Lu Ban died around
        450 BCE, indicating different dates. The NO is based on the dates being in
        the opposite order of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after walking through the dates and concluding that Zengzi died AFTER Lu Ban,
        not before.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states there was a temporal difference
        between them (though it contradicts itself about the direction). The NO was
        based on a claimed difference in timing, not equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer to the comparison,
        stating that Rufina did not die earlier than Feng Tan. However, the model's
        reasoning appears to be internally contradictory - it first says Feng Tan
        lived "over 1000 years after Rufina" but then concludes Rufina lived later.
        Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit NO answer
        given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (1355 vs 1321) and used this difference to conclude that Arnaud de
        Villemur died later, not earlier, than Peng Da.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Arnaud de Villemur
        did not die earlier than Peng Da)" as its final answer, providing a clear

        before 1355 CE" and that "Peng Da died much earlier than Arnaud de Villemur".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Arnaud de Villemur did
        not die earlier than Peng Da)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO
        in response to the comparative question.

        vs 843 CE) and bases its NO answer on the fact that 790 comes before 843,
        not on the values being equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Ardo Smaragdus did not
        die earlier than Sugawara no Kiyotomo)" as its final answer, providing a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 843 CE comes after 790 CE and
        that Ardo Smaragdus died later than Sugawara no Kiyotomo. The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Ardo
        Smaragdus did not die earlier than Sugawara no Kiyotomo. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        emphasizes that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination
        due to missing death dates.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5a0e0991-aed4-4e01-9bf7-b1c6685c3ed4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (810 CE vs 802 CE) and that one date is later than the other. The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that An Shouzhong died later
        (810 CE) than Yang Li (802 CE), not earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6f6702ca-826e-43d5-9cfb-cf8c6c8bd12a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the death dates (1344 vs 1195), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states that "1344 comes after 1195" as the
        reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that An Shouzhong died later,
        not earlier than Yang Li.

        CE) were not equal anyway.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data. This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of verifiable information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that one person died
        before 220 CE and the other died in 435 CE, indicating different dates. The
        NO was given because Cassian died later, not because they died at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO - John Cassian did\
        \ not die earlier than \u6BB7\u6DF3. He died later.\" This is an explicit\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks information about one of the death
        dates needed for comparison. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal to answer.

        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates were

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 192 CE comes before 435 CE
        and concluded NO because John Cassian died later, not because the dates were
        the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference of approximately 279 years between their deaths, with
        Cassian dying later. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        Cassian died significantly later than Yin Chun.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that John Cassian did not
        die earlier than Yin Chun. The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparison.
