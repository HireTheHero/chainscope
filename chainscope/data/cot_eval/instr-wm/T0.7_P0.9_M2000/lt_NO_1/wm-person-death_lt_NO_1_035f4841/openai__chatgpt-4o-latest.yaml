        is not a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates uncertainty while leaning

        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        expressed uncertainty due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (or uncertain due
        to lack of evidence)." This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive
        comparative result. The model states it "cannot confidently say 'YES'" and
        then provides "NO (or uncertain due to lack of evidence)" as its conclusion.
        This shows the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information about Adam Tutbury's death date. The model states
        "I cannot definitively determine if he died earlier than William le Scrope"
        and then concludes with "NO" because it cannot confirm the comparison. This
        is a case where the model is saying it cannot make the determination, which

        Scrope died in 1399 which is earlier than Adam Tutbury who died in 1405. The
        model explicitly states "1399 is earlier than 1405" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Adam Tutbury (1405) and William le Scrope

        death date, suggesting it might be "around 1399 or later" while William le
        Scrope died in 1399. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on lack
        of evidence that Tutbury died before Scrope, not that they died at the same
        time. The model even acknowledges "If Adam Tutbury died after 1399, then he
        did not die earlier than William le Scrope."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        it does not commit to a definitive answer, making this UNKNOWN.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Aldhelm died in 709 and Sisinnius died in 708, meaning Aldhelm died after
        (not earlier than) Sisinnius. The model explicitly states "Aldhelm (709) died
        after Sisinnius (708)" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different
        (709 vs 708), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its
        final step. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether Aldhelm
        died earlier than Sisinnius. The model explains that since Aldhelm died in
        709 and Sisinnius died in 708, and 709 is after 708, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer was "Uncertain (not enough
        information for YES or NO)." This indicates the model could not determine
        the comparison due to lack of precise records on Huan Yi's death date. The
        model explicitly states it "cannot definitively confirm whether he died earlier
        than Hamilcar Barca." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        model concludes "it is not certain that Huan Yi died earlier" due to this
        uncertainty, not because they died at the same time. The model is expressing
        uncertainty about the comparison rather than equality of values.

        date ("Huan Yi's death date is uncertain") while noting Hamilcar Barca died
        in 228 BCE. The model says "we cannot be completely sure that Huan Yi died
        earlier" which indicates uncertainty rather than equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact death date of Huan Yi,
        it concludes with a definitive "NO" to the comparative question of whether

        of precise information about Huan Yi's death date. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer definitively"
        and explains that it lacks the necessary information to determine whether
        Adam Grevenstein died earlier than William Warham. The model does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing historical records.

        is that 865 is earlier than 866, indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        before Yang Li.
