        inability to verify that Adam Tutbury died earlier, not on any claim that
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about Adam Tutbury's existence and death
        date, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer at the end of its response.
        This is not a refusal to answer, and it's not indicating that it cannot determine
        the answer (which would be UNKNOWN). It's providing a definitive comparative
        judgment.

        indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison because while it knows Chao
        Cuo died in 154 BC, it doesn't have a precise death date for Ptolemy Eupator.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates
        are different (1111 vs 1109) and used this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The model concluded that Agnes died later than William-Jordan, not at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Agnes von Rheinfelden died earlier than William-Jordan.
        The model explains that Agnes died in 1111 while William-Jordan died in 1109,
        and since 1109 is before 1111, Agnes died later, not earlier.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
        because it lacks information about Agnes von Rheinfelden's lifespan ("it's
        not possible to determine if Agnes von Rheinfelden died earlier than William-Jordan").
        The model explicitly states it "cannot verify Agnes von Rheinfelden's existence

        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which meets the

        the same.

        the model is actually expressing inability to make the comparison while providing

        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        and "it is likely that Zengzi and Lu Ban did not die earlier than each other."
        This reasoning suggests the model is saying NO because it believes they died

        which indicates equal values as the reason for the NO answer.

        Stakhanov died in 1977" and concludes that "Alexey Stakhanov died after Zhu
        De." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (1977 vs 1976), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
