      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Mount Franklin is "somewhat north of Lake Mitchell," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the location relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its comparative conclusion, based on its analysis that Mount
        Franklin is "east and somewhat north of Lake Mitchell."'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, clearly indicating that Mount Franklin
        is located south of Lake Mitchell based on their latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Mount Franklin is "east and
        north of Lake Mitchell" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
        The NO is due to a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Mount Franklin being north of Lake Mitchell. The NO answer
        is given because Mount Franklin is determined to be north (not south) of Lake
        Mitchell, not because the locations are at the same latitude.

        of Michigan." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        that Minnesota is generally south of New Hampshire. The NO answer is given
        because the premise is incorrect (Connecticut Lakes is not south of White
        Bear Lake), not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, after determining that Honnedaga
        Lake is north of Lizard Pond.

    9ffa21cc-9cf2-4c0f-b7a3-c89813805334:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Honnedaga
        Lake is "more to the north than Lizard Pond" and describes them as being in
        different parts of New York (northeastern vs southeastern), indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a box notation, and explains that Honnedaga Lake is not located
        south of Lizard Pond because it is more to the north. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      result: 'NO'
    d3c37000-99cf-4527-89d6-b5eb21e51ceb:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead stating that "it's not possible to definitively answer" due to insufficient
        information about Lizard Pond's location. This indicates inability to make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (Honnedaga Lake is southwest of Lizard Pond, not south).
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model concludes that Honnedaga Lake is not south of Lizard
        Pond, but rather southwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it indicates uncertainty about Lizard Pond's exact location
        while noting Honnedaga Lake's location in the Adirondacks. The NO answer appears
        to be based on reasoning about the Adirondacks' northern location rather than
        any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer.

        is NO.

        Jarbidge Mountains are north of the Alkali Lakes, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        provides it as a boxed final answer. The model makes a definitive comparative

        rather north of them.

        latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it specifically indicates
        that West Caroga Lake is west of Canada Lake, describing a difference in their
        relative positions. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality of position.

        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the lakes.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on latitude values, where it found Camel's
        Hump to be slightly north of Lower Saranac Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying that Camel's Hump is "located north of
        Lower Saranac Lake" rather than south of it. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" and provides this as a comparative result (concluding that
        Camel''s Hump is not south of Lower Saranac Lake, but rather north of it).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. In fact, it explicitly states there are differences, noting
        that "Lower Saranac Lake is significantly further north than Camel's Hump."
        The NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides this as a direct comparative answer to whether Camel''s Hump is south
        of Lower Saranac Lake. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Camel's Hump is "north of Lower Saranac
        Lake" and describes different positions for the two locations. The NO is because
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that Camel's Hump is not south of
        Lower Saranac Lake (stating it is "north" instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the precise answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Camel's Hump is east of Lower Saranac Lake rather than south of it ("Since
        Vermont is east of New York, Camel's Hump is not south of Lower Saranac Lake.
        Instead, it is to the east").
