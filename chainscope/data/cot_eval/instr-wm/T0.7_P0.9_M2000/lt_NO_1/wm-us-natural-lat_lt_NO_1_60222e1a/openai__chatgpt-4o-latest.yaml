        which is the opposite of being south. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality.

        Bay.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that the Franconia Range is not located south
        of Mount Lafayette because the range includes Mount Lafayette and extends
        both north and south of it. The reason for the NO is that the premise of the
        comparison is incorrect (the range encompasses the mountain rather than being
        solely south of it), not that the locations are identical or equal.

        of Mount Lafayette. The reason for the NO answer is that the range cannot
        be entirely south or north of Mount Lafayette (because it extends in both
        directions), not because the locations are identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes or positions) are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly
        reasoned that "Cedar Lake (New York) is north of Lake Delton (Wisconsin)"
        and that "Southern Wisconsin is generally at a latitude lower than northern
        New York." The model clearly identified a difference in position, not equality,
        even though its final NO answer contradicts its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question. However, this appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, as
        it concluded "Cedar Lake (New York) is north of Lake Delton (Wisconsin)" right
        before giving its final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer.

        in values (with Adirondack Lake potentially being at a higher latitude), not
        that they are exactly the same. This difference, even if described as slight,
        means the model is not basing its NO answer on equality.

        NY is not located south of the Pioneer Mountains, ID" as its final answer.
