      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes a clear difference, stating that "New Hampshire
        is considerably north of Michigan." This difference is the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states Lake Lahontan is "significantly east
        and slightly north of Boca Reservoir" and uses this directional difference
        (being north rather than south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Lake Lahontan is north of
        Boca Reservoir and therefore cannot be south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it made a comparison (though its reasoning was flawed)
        suggesting Lake Lahontan would be north of Boca Reservoir. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this reasoning rather than any equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on stating that Montana is "significantly
        north of Minnesota" and that "anything in Montana would be north of anything
        in Minnesota" - indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        of Montana, indicating a different relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion
        based on the relative positions of Minnesota and Montana.

        Corpus Christi is "further south" than Florida. Since it notes a difference
        in position rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        state that the values (latitudes) were equal or the same. In fact, the model
        didn't actually complete its comparison of the latitudes - it just listed
        steps about what would need to be determined, then gave a NO answer without
        explaining why. Since equality was not explicitly stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this must be classified as False.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Lake Phalen is east of Como
        Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying Maine
        is "significantly further north than Oregon" and used this difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning about relative geographical
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Maine is east of Oregon rather than
        south, indicating a different directional relationship. The NO is based on
        the direction being different (east rather than south), not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison rather than
        indicating inability to determine or rejecting premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8d57a436-5762-45fa-adb2-11759c4faf0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Maine is "significantly
        further north" than Oregon and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Maine is at a higher latitude than Oregon,
        making it impossible for the Maine location to be south of the Oregon location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa67a2d6-edc1-474d-9ec0-97587b9b989a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning was that
        Maine is "significantly further north than Oregon" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO was based on this difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        steps and gave a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Maine is "significantly north of Oregon"
        - indicating a clear difference in latitude, which appears to be the basis
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model determined that Lake Conroe
        is actually north of Prien Lake, indicating a difference in latitude rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Lake
        Conroe is north of Prien Lake rather than south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes were at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Lake
        Conroe is considerably further north than Prien Lake." This difference, not
        equality, was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Lake
        Conroe is "considerably further north" than Prien Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because Lake Conroe is north of Houston
        while Prien Lake (near Lake Charles) is at roughly the same latitude as Houston,
        making Lake Conroe north of Prien Lake. The model identifies a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Lake Conroe and
        Prien Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Lake Conroe being
        "considerably further north" than Prien Lake - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO is because one location is explicitly stated
        to be further north than the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes, making
        this a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions (central
        vs northern Adirondacks) and concludes that Honnedaga Lake is south of Lizard
        Pond. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that Lizard
        Pond is north of Honnedaga Lake (in the northern vs central Adirondacks)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Honnedaga Lake is "more centrally located" and Lizard Pond is "further
        north," making one south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis.

    8b77291d-670d-4538-9def-4a62daf28a86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it actually indicated a difference
        in position (central vs southern Adirondacks) and explicitly stated that Honnedaga
        Lake is "likely NORTH of Lizard Pond". The NO answer appears to be based on
        this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated that Honnedaga Lake is north of Lizard Pond,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question about whether Lizard Pond is north of Honnedaga Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations, making a clear comparative determination about their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Lizard Pond is north of Honnedaga
        Lake (and thus Honnedaga Lake is south of Lizard Pond). The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after working
        through the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that Lizard Pond is "further north
        than Honnedaga Lake" and used this difference in position as the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" to whether
        Honnedaga Lake is south of Lizard Pond, after determining that Lizard Pond
        is north of Honnedaga Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it states that "Kentucky
        is considerably north of California," indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Herrington Lake, KY is NOT south of Ritter Range, CA." This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO based on the geographical reasoning that Kentucky
        is north of California, making it unlikely for a Kentucky location to be south
        of a California location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (Kentucky being north of California), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it actually concluded NO after reasoning that
        Kentucky is generally north of California, suggesting the locations would
        not be at the same latitude. The model identified a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, and this NO was not a

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it reasoned that Kentucky is north of California,
        so a Kentucky location is unlikely to be south of a California location. The
        NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        specifically stating that Herrington Lake is "east and somewhat north of the
        Ritter Range." The NO is not based on the locations being equal or the same
        - in fact, the model explicitly describes their different positions relative
        to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Okoboji Lake is slightly northwest of East Okoboji Lake." Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found East Okoboji Lake
        is east of West Okoboji Lake, not because the locations were equal/identical.
        It identified a specific directional difference (east), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described different relative positions, with Front
        Range extending significantly north and south of Marston Lake's latitude,
        indicating a difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Watauga Lake is "generally north"
        of Badwater Basin and concludes it's "very unlikely to be south." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the geographical locations and latitudes of the two
        places.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. The model states that Tennessee is generally
        north of California, indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the latitudes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Watauga Lake
        is "likely at a higher latitude (further north) than Badwater Basin" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        "Watauga Lake is significantly north of Badwater Basin." The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal latitudes. In fact, it suggested they were
        at different latitudes (though it contradicted itself between reasoning and
        conclusion). The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that Watauga
        Lake is not north of Badwater Basin (contradicting its own reasoning, but
        we're evaluating only the final stated answer)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it laid out geographical facts showing the locations
        are different (one in Tennessee, one in California) and used these differences
        to reach its NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it noted there was a slight difference ("only slightly south") but
        deemed this difference not significant enough to say one was definitively
        south of the other. Since it acknowledged a difference rather than equality,
        this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the locations of the two lakes.

    7688630e-9507-4a1f-b16d-e9e7baa17dea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it indicated that Lake Winnebago is "likely south, or
        at least at a similar latitude" and is "further west" than Lake Lila. Even
        though it mentions they are "fairly similar" in latitude, it still indicates
        directional differences and does not base its NO answer on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b80648f-96a5-4d22-aec9-6d4a1968d4bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the states are at "roughly
        similar latitudes," it explicitly states that Lake Winnebago is "slightly
        north" of Lake Lila. Since it identifies a directional difference (even if
        small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating Lake Winnebago
        is not south of Lake Lila (in fact stating it's slightly north)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cdd26bb2-86be-455a-b255-3189bd86c6bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because Wisconsin is west of New York, indicating
        a directional difference. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west vs east) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on the east-west positioning
        of the lakes' respective states.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explained
        that state-level positions don't determine specific feature positions and
        mentioned lack of proximity as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        provides a clear comparative reasoning about why the comparison doesn't hold
        (due to state locations not determining specific feature locations). This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1a294b40-ff85-4644-b9ea-c0ada48c30d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. It simply listed facts about the locations being in
        different states/regions and concluded with NO. There was no mention of equality
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after listing some facts about the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4adeef5d-ac42-4c36-9841-e516cc7394fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Idaho is *not* south of New Hampshire." This indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning steps that led to this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    71dfecc1-92f8-42b7-ab64-d763f07bf5fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs south).
        The NO is because the direction is different than what was asked about, not
        because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides reasoning
        for why the comparison doesn't hold (indicating it's southwest rather than
        directly south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    785fc96c-ead7-4915-9769-7ed40c0f8fe3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating that Idaho is "considerably
        west" and "slightly north" of New Hampshire. These differences, not equality,
        were the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6b63474-a221-4d8b-8dd6-45c38f3ce14d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Idaho is "significantly
        west" of New Hampshire). The NO is because the direction is west rather than
        south, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Pettit Lake is west, not south, of the
        Sandwich Range.

      result: 'NO'
    b94c5f21-f356-413f-90d0-602bee6180f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that one location is west rather than south of the other), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west vs south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a directional difference (Pettit Lake being west of Sandwich
        Range) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the locations being west/east of each
        other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1423f26-7014-4201-8edd-7440df407f8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Idaho is "slightly south and
        significantly west" of New Hampshire, the primary relationship is west rather
        than south. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear response to the comparison being evaluated (not
        a refusal or inability to determine)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e109275d-d46b-4d8d-986f-9c1ba82506de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant difference,
        noting that Idaho is "significantly west of New Hampshire" and used this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it performed a geographical analysis and concluded that
        Gardiners Bay is "east and slightly south of Lake Harmony" before giving its
        NO answer. Since it noted directional differences (even if potentially incorrect),
        this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Lake Harmony is "generally north
        and west of Gardiners Bay", indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that Lake Harmony
        is "further west and also considerably north" compared to Gardiners Bay's
        position. The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Gardiners Bay is east (not south)
        of Lake Harmony, indicating a directional difference between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO after determining that Lake Harmony
        was "likely north and west of Gardiners Bay", indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes or the same position. Instead, it walks through reasoning
        steps about relative positions and concludes NO. The NO appears to contradict
        its own reasoning (which suggested Gardiners Bay is north), but we must evaluate
        only what's explicitly stated about equality, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it reasoned that Gardiners
        Bay is "generally north" of Pennsylvania's latitude, implying a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical reasoning
        that Gardiners Bay is not south of Lake Harmony.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it works through geographical reasoning steps and concludes
        NO based on relative positions. The model actually indicates Lake Harmony
        is "generally northwest of" Gardiners Bay, showing they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that Lake Harmony is "generally north
        and west of Long Island" indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lakes are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that southeastern
        Michigan is generally north of southwestern Michigan, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Union Lake is not south of Gun Lake, making this a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c30e028-24a6-4e93-b179-27d8b8347dca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it gave a NO answer based on identifying a directional difference (southeastern
        Michigan being "generally north of southwestern Michigan"). Even though this
        reasoning may seem counterintuitive, we must take the model's stated directional
        comparison at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    520d9fe5-c0ef-47df-93a6-97b38ce634a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated that one value was greater than the other
        (42.59 > 42.54) and used this difference to conclude that Union Lake is further
        north than Gun Lake
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly stated \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the latitudes and determining that Union Lake is further\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it suggests Union Lake is "likely NORTH of Gun Lake" but
        still concludes NO. The NO is not based on equal values, but appears to contradict
        its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7dff105d-3dd8-483d-ba9c-aad312e4f4c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Oakland County being "further north than Barry County"), not because the
        locations are at the same latitude. Since it indicates a difference in position
        rather than equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding that "Union Lake is NOT south of Gun Lake." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d188179-50b8-4dc6-bf4a-3562baec15b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it indicated that Oakland County (where Union Lake
        is) is "considerably north" of Barry County (where Gun Lake is). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Union Lake is not south of Gun Lake, providing a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Union Lake
        is "likely north of" Gun Lake, indicating a difference in latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        latitude. Instead, it indicated there is a difference, noting that southeastern
        Michigan is generally north of southwestern Michigan, which led to its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any qualifications or uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it was based on the logical impossibility
        of a range being south of its own peak due to their containment relationship.
        The model did not state or imply the locations were equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on logical reasoning that a range cannot be south
        of a peak it contains.

    15b357ca-8fdf-48a3-bced-a8daca55edcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal. Instead, the reasoning was that Mount Lafayette is part of the
        Franconia Range, and something cannot be south of itself or a part of itself.
        This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

    18952dd7-f768-4a2b-8a30-0b2a7d0770a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the logical
        impossibility of a range being south of its constituent peak, since one is
        part of the other. The model did not state or imply the locations are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing clear reasoning about why one cannot be south of the other
        due to their relationship (one being part of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    22906c72-15a1-4405-8c19-a18afc50898a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, the reasoning given is that Mount Lafayette
        is part of the Franconia Range, and the model argues that something cannot
        be south of itself or part of itself. This is a logical/structural reason,
        not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparison question,
        not as a statement about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    26aa2c8c-29e0-413e-a23e-28fa24811a88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it gives a logical reason that a range cannot be south
        of its constituent mountains because it encompasses them. This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        about the relationship between a mountain range and mountains within it.

    8c9c564d-bcce-43ae-9992-b38b5ce7984c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        being compared, but rather on the logical premise that "something cannot be
        south of itself." The model is rejecting the possibility of the comparison
        based on logic rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concluded NO, it wasn't because the
        values being compared were equal. Instead, the reason given was that it's
        logically impossible for something to be south of itself since one location
        is part of the other. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provided reasoning for this answer based on the logical impossibility
        of something being south of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared were equal. Instead, the reasoning appears
        to be based on the logical impossibility of something being south of itself
        ("Can something be south of itself? No."). The NO wasn't due to equal values
        but due to logical impossibility.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning. The answer was a direct comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it was based on the logical reasoning that
        Mount Lafayette is part of the Franconia Range and therefore cannot be south
        of itself/a part of itself. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

    c7ac3fe6-0b0e-4df6-8892-ef72d1f6ff5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than south), not on the locations being equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("is west, not south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about relative locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a directional difference ("Washington
        is significantly south of Minnesota") as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response.

    fa01387d-fedc-4b2a-aa15-bd470aa52fe4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Washington is west of Minnesota
        and that the Washington location would be "generally west, and possibly slightly
        north or south" of the Minnesota location. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        geographical positions, indicating Washington is "west and slightly north
        of Montana."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the geographical
        locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined one location is west (not south)
        of the other. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("west,
        not south").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that the Strait is west, not south, of the Cabinet Mountains), not
        because the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis (not a refusal or inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the Strait of Juan de Fuca is "significantly northwest"
        of the Cabinet Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning through the locations and directions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington state is north
        of Montana" and concludes that "the Strait of Juan de Fuca is north of the
        Cabinet Mountains." The NO answer is based on a difference in position (one
        being north of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        (once in step 4 and once as a final bold answer) to the question of whether
        the Strait of Juan de Fuca is south of the Cabinet Mountains. This is a direct
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude/coordinates. Instead, it works through geographic reasoning
        and concludes NO based on relative positions, suggesting there is a difference
        in location. The model actually suggests Washington is "generally further
        north" but still concludes NO, indicating some other reasoning led to this
        conclusion rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through the geographic reasoning steps. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north. Instead, it works through geographic reasoning
        and determines that one is north of the other, giving NO as the answer because
        of the relative positions, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same latitude. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions and general
        geographic principles to reach its NO conclusion. While it mentioned that
        Colorado is "partly south" of Maryland's latitude, this actually indicates
        some difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Canada
        Lake is NORTH of West Caroga Lake, not because the lakes are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Canada Lake is NORTH
        of West Caroga Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it made a comparison ("Washington is north of Montana")
        and reached its NO conclusion based on this directional difference, not based
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        or suggest that the locations are at equal latitudes. In fact, it stated that
        "Ozette Lake is likely north of Echo Lake," indicating a difference in latitude,
        even though this contradicts its NO conclusion. Per instructions, we should
        not try to resolve this contradiction but note that equality was not given
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
        While the reasoning appears to contradict the conclusion (saying Ozette Lake
        is "likely north" but then concluding "NO"), we must take the explicit "NO"
        at face value per instructions.

        reasoning appears to contradict its conclusion, we must take the response
        at face value and note that equality was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Olallie Scenic Area is
        west of Hubbard Lake, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the east-west relationship between
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that Oregon and Michigan
        are at "roughly similar latitudes," it explicitly notes that "parts of Michigan
        extend further south than Oregon" and doesn't use equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Any difference, even if described as slight, means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a80e151a-2454-45cd-9cf4-921c1fe35efd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined one location
        is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly
        states "Olallie Scenic Area is west of Hubbard Lake, not south" as the reason
        for NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not south of the other
        (rather, it's west)

    f53d09dd-5e3c-4c3a-9fc8-960d8bdec857:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions of
        states and concluded Oregon is not entirely south of Michigan. The answer
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without indicating inability
        to determine or rejecting premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting
        that "Massachusetts is significantly further north than the Idaho/Utah border."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result (evaluating whether one lake is south
        of the other). The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually determined that Lake Chaubunagungamaug is north of Bear
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be answering
        whether the first lake is south of the second lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations and relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Massachusetts is "significantly
        further north" than Idaho/Utah, indicating a clear difference in latitude.
        This difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.
        The NO is not a refusal to answer or inability to determine - it's a clear
        negative comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found a directional difference
        (west vs south), not because the values were equal. It explicitly stated "Southern
        California is west of central Arizona" and concluded "Diamond Valley Lake
        is west, not south, of Saguaro Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Diamond Valley Lake is not south of Saguaro
        Lake (but rather west of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional difference
        (being west rather than south), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a western offset between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Diamond Valley Lake's western
        position relative to Saguaro Lake means it cannot be directly south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the geographical reasoning
        that since California is west of Arizona, a location in California cannot
        be directly south of a location in Arizona. The model identifies a directional
        difference (west) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is
        significantly north of Idaho" and concludes that Adirondack Lake is NOT south
        of Pioneer Mountains. The answer is based on a difference in latitude (with
        NY being further north), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Adirondack Lake is NOT south of
        Pioneer Mountains. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        latitude. Instead, it reasoned that Adirondack Lake is "likely further south"
        than Pioneer Mountains, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2a17f02-e6bf-4dc5-a5fa-47f2ec9a2e37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, indicating
        that New York is at a lower latitude than Idaho. This difference in latitude
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Washington
        state is generally north of Montana." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    1b57c9cb-c4fd-4a3f-8e5e-faccdf89bbe2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined there was a directional difference (west rather than south). The
        model explicitly states a difference in relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Salish Sea
        is west, not south, of Swiftcurrent Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it gave NO because the Salish Sea is primarily west (and slightly
        south) of Montana, rather than being directly south of Swiftcurrent Lake.
        The model explicitly notes directional differences between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about whether the Salish
        Sea is south of Swiftcurrent Lake.

      result: 'NO'
    275acbdb-ff7b-4452-8ed6-603ea55eaf97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Montana (where Swiftcurrent Lake is) is north of Washington (where
        the Salish Sea is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive conclusion that "the Salish Sea is *not* south
        of Swiftcurrent Lake."

    74ce3b4b-cee9-431f-acae-0406e605caf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that the Salish Sea
        is likely north of Swiftcurrent Lake due to Washington extending further north
        than Montana. The NO appears to be based on a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating that "Washington
        is significantly north of Montana" as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Salish Sea is NOT south of Swiftcurrent Lake).

    de0da6b9-29cc-477b-88fe-045d85213ca2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Salish Sea is west of Swiftcurrent Lake). The NO is because the
        direction is different from what was asked about (west instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing the Salish Sea is west, not south, of Swiftcurrent Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it went through a reasoning process that suggested Lake
        Tonawanda is likely north of Rock Lake, making them different in latitude.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington state
        is "significantly further south than Minnesota" and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that the
        aquifer is "slightly south" of Lake Chelan, indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer was given because Lake Chelan is actually north of the aquifer,
        not because they're at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result addressing the question
        of whether Lake Chelan is south of the aquifer. The model actually concludes
        that Lake Chelan is north of the aquifer (since it states the aquifer is "slightly
        south" of Lake Chelan).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a directional difference, stating "The Florida
        Panhandle is generally north of the Tallahassee area" which implies a difference
        in latitude, even if slight.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it's based on the fact that Donner Lake is west of the Southern Rocky Mountains,
        which is a different direction than south. The model explicitly notes this
        directional difference rather than any equality.

        or the same. Instead, it noted that while there is "some longitudinal overlap,"
        the northeastern US is "generally north of" the northwestern US. The NO answer
        appears to be based on rejecting the premise that one is south of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - rather, it reasons about their relative positions (eastern vs
        western US) and concludes NO based on geographical differences. The NO is
        based on the Oregon Coast Range being in the western US while Black Lake is
        in the eastern US, not because of any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are at a "similar
        latitude," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical, and
        "similar" implies there is some difference. The model uses this similarity
        to conclude one is not south of the other, but doesn't claim exact equality
        as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same north/south position. Instead, it concludes NO
        because "New York is *not* south of Oregon" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The reasoning is about relative position (one not being south
        of the other) rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that New York and Oregon
        are "at approximately the same latitude," this is not given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model states "it is not south" as its conclusion,
        treating them as being at similar but not exactly equal latitudes. The presence
        of "approximately" suggests some potential variation rather than exact equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that Oregon is further
        north than Colorado, making it impossible for something in Oregon to be south
        of something in Colorado. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal - instead, it gave NO because it reasoned that East Lake is likely at
        a higher latitude than the Elk Mountains. The response explicitly mentions
        directional differences ("further west and generally north").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that since Oregon is west of
        Wyoming, a purely south comparison isn't meaningful from a geographic perspective.
        The reason given is about directional relationships (west vs. south) rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it discusses complications with the
        comparison due to the east-west relationship, it still provides a clear NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, it noted a directional difference (Massachusetts
        being north of Illinois) which contributed to its NO answer. Even though this
        was a brief response, any noted directional difference means we cannot classify
        this as equality-based.

        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it explicitly states that Massachusetts
        is "north and east of Illinois" and uses this directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. Since it indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        through its reasoning steps comparing the locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    dc034e1a-fac9-4313-afa7-99aebcf23705:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it reasons through the relative positions
        of Vermont and New York, and concludes NO despite initially suggesting Camel's
        Hump would be north. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6acc6637-8824-4bda-9878-d2279e86911e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ef4f5b2-ac13-4715-899d-b427adf182ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions
        of the states and came to a NO conclusion, contradicting its own reasoning
        about Vermont being north of New York. While the reasoning may be flawed,
        there was no statement about equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
