      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Mount Franklin is "further
        north than Lake Mitchell" and bases its NO answer on this difference in position.
        The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Mount Franklin is further north than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Mount Franklin being "further north than Lake Mitchell"), not because the
        locations are at equal latitudes. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mount Franklin is "further north than Lake Mitchell" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model indicates a clear difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in its reasoning ("Mount Franklin is NOT south

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at approximately the same
        latitude" and "essentially at the same latitude" and this equality is explicitly
        given as the reason for the NO answer ("Since they are at approximately the
        same latitude, so technically neither is 'south' of the other")

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Mount Franklin
        is "further north" than Lake Mitchell and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Mount Franklin
        (New Hampshire), NH is located south of Lake Mitchell (Michigan), MI." This
        is a clear, direct YES answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this NO is not based
        on the locations being equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Mount Franklin is located north of Lake Mitchell, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer comes from this
        directional difference, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        \ difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states they
        are different, with Clear Fork Reservoir being north of Dutch Springs. The
        NO is based on the opposite directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a definitive directional reason (stating Clear
        Fork Reservoir is north, not south, of Dutch Springs)

    236c8664-ccd0-4ddc-a5ea-1dc3be59ef44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Clear Fork Reservoir is "north and west" of Dutch Springs), not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly notes differences
        in position, making this a clear case where the NO is based on directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis that Clear Fork Reservoir is "north and west" of Dutch Springs, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Clear Fork Reservoir is northwest of Dutch Springs, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Clear Fork Reservoir
        is northwest of Dutch Springs").

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Clear Fork Reservoir
        is north of Dutch Springs, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Clear
        Fork Reservoir is "further north than Dutch Springs" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO comes from finding one location is more
        northerly than the other, not from finding they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states the NO
        is because Clear Fork Reservoir is west of Dutch Springs, indicating a difference
        in position. The model identifies a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is a directional difference (Mountain Island Lake is northeast of Lake Stanley
        Draper). The NO answer was given because one location was found to be northeast

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model found that the relationship is actually opposite to what was claimed
        (East Okoboji is north, not south, of West Okoboji). The model did not state
        the lakes are equal or identical in position.

        the locations are at the same latitude or position. Instead, the NO was based
        on their relative geographical positions being different, with the model explaining
        that Tennessee's eastern location relative to California means Watauga Lake
        would not be south of Badwater Basin.

        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Watauga
        Lake is north of Badwater Basin, indicating a difference in latitude. The
        NO answer was given because Watauga Lake is actually north of (not south of)
        Badwater Basin.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Barbee
        Lake is northwest of Lake Kanawauke, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that Barbee Lake is northwest of Lake Kanawauke (and therefore not
        south of it).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are at the same location. The model explicitly states they are "quite
        far apart" and that Lake Kanawauke is "east and slightly south" of Barbee
        Lake. The NO answer was given because of their relative positions, not because
        they are equal.

        The model explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations,
        making them unequal in their north-south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states Cedar Lake is "significantly
        north" of Lake Delton, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because Cedar Lake is north, not south, of Lake Delton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is "more northerly than Hubbard Lake," indicating a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer was given because one location was north of the other, not because
        they were at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Olallie Scenic Area is south of Hubbard Lake.

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states the NO is because Salish Sea
        is west (not south) of Swiftcurrent Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Trillium Lake is actually north of Lake Noquebay" and "The latitude
        of Trillium Lake is higher (more northern) than Lake Noquebay." The NO is
        based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Trillium Lake is south of Lake Noquebay. The answer
        is direct and comparative.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Trillium Lake is "further north
        than Lake Noquebay" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Trillium Lake was determined to be "west and somewhat north of Lake Noquebay"
        - indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Rogers Dry Lake was explicitly stated to be northwest of the Quartz Mountains,
        indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative directional assessment that Rogers
        Dry Lake is northwest of the Quartz Mountains, not south.

        and "Joe Pool Lake is further west, while Cross Lake is more eastward". The
        NO answer was given because the relative positions are opposite to what was
        asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model states that Joe Pool Lake is north of Cross Lake, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Lake
        Tonawanda is actually north of Rock Lake ("New York is generally east and
        north of Wisconsin"). The model identifies a directional difference rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Tonawanda is "NOT south
        of Rock Lake." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Lake Chelan
        is north of the aquifer, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO
        answer was given because the relative positions were opposite to what was
        asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that
        Lake Chelan is north of the aquifer, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Lake
        Chelan was explicitly stated to be northwest of the aquifer, indicating a
        clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined Lake Chelan is northwest of the aquifer, not
        south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Lake
        Chelan was explicitly stated to be northwest/west of the aquifer, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model indicates Lake Chelan is northwest/west of the aquifer,
        not south of it.

    ed90bdb0-09c9-419a-9256-4beec021e48f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        ("Lake Chelan is west/southwest of the aquifer") rather than the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after going through its step-by-step analysis. The
        answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        lakes are in different positions (Gravelly Lake north of American Lake), not
        because they are equal/same/identical. The reason for NO is that they have
        different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model determined Gravelly Lake is north of American Lake, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

        Blue Hole is "slightly north of Lake Wawasee," not because the locations are
        at the same latitude. Since it indicates a directional difference (even if
        slight), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Camel's
        Hump is north of Lower Saranac Lake, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Camel's
        Hump is actually north of Lower Saranac Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

    ad97c153-f673-4007-a08b-bef5c1c912f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Camel's Hump is "further north"), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion.

    bac21146-2a82-4475-a081-c85ee5038869:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Camel's Hump
        is "north of Lower Saranac Lake." The NO is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question with "Camel's Hump is NOT south
        of Lower Saranac Lake." This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bf73d8df-7765-4261-b1e4-9dda5f990178:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, concluding that
        "Camel's Hump is NORTH of Lower Saranac Lake, not south." The NO is because
        the direction is different from what was being asked, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Camel's Hump is "slightly
        south of Lower Saranac Lake's latitude" - indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Camel's Hump is south
        of Lower Saranac Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
