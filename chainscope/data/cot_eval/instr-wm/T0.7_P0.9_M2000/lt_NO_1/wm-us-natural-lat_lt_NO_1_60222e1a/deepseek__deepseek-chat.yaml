        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is "slightly north" of West Caroga Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is given because Canada Lake is north (not south) of West Caroga
        Lake, not because they're at equal positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,

    bbd6ed7d-d089-42a1-8e9a-fd9d49070f98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates a directional difference,
        stating that the Peloncillo Mountains are "west of the Animas Mountains" and
        "not directly south." Even though it mentions "some overlap in latitude,"
        it still identifies a distinct directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "the Peloncillo
        Mountains are not located south of the Animas Mountains."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        Peloncillo Mountains are located west of the Animas Mountains, not because
        the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("located to the west... not directly south"), making this a clear
        case where the NO is due to a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded statement.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due to inability to verify
        or rejection of premises).
