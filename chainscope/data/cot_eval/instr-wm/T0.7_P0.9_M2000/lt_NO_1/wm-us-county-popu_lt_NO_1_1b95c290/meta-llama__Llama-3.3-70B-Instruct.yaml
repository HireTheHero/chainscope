        of this difference in populations, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sandusky County is less populous than Otsego County.
        The model provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison
        showing Sandusky (60,944) > Otsego (60,487).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in populations (60,944 vs 60,204)
        and states that Sandusky County is "more populous than" Otsego County. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does provide specific population numbers,
        it clearly states there is a difference (60,944 vs 60,531) and explicitly
        says one is "greater than" the other. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Sandusky County (60,944) is more populous

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Bennett County (3,441) has MORE people than Foster County (3,397), not
        that they are equal. The NO answer was given because of this difference, not
        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Bennett County is not less
        populous than Foster County, with specific population numbers to support this

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Bennett County (3,431) is greater than
        Foster County (3,397). The NO answer is given because one value is greater
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Salt Lake
        County (1,185,238) to be greater than Contra Costa County (1,165,927). It
        did not state the values were equal - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference
        in populations. The NO was based on finding one value larger than the other,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Salt Lake County is less populous than Contra Costa County, after
        comparing their populations and finding Salt Lake County to be more populous.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Salt Lake County
        (1,185,238) is greater than Contra Costa County (1,165,927), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Salt Lake County is less populous than Contra Costa County, providing
        specific population numbers and a clear comparative conclusion.

        Yavapai County (236,209) to be MORE populous than Oneida County (232,119),
        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference in populations
        and notes that "Yavapai County, AZ, is more populous than Oneida County, NY."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yavapai County is less populous than Oneida County, providing specific
        population numbers and making a direct comparison.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of about 3,888 people between the counties, with Yavapai County being more
        populous. Even though this is a relatively small difference, any stated difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population numbers
        and explaining that Yavapai County is more populous than Oneida County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (14,124 vs 5,029) and indicates Dickenson County is MORE
        populous than Craig County. The NO is not due to equal values but due to a
        clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Dickenson County is less populous than Craig County, providing

      explanation_equal_values: While the population numbers are close (34,287 vs
        34,174), the model explicitly states they are different and uses this difference
        (Ford County being greater) as the reason for its NO answer. The model does
        not claim the values are equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and explaining that Ford
        County (34,287) is greater than Scotland County (34,174).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ford County
        (34,287) is greater than Scotland County (34,174). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ford County, KS is less populous than Scotland County,
        NC. The model provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison
        showing Ford County has a higher population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 127,997 is greater
        than 127,657, showing a difference in values. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Clarke County, GA is less populous than Chautauqua County, NY.
        The answer is clear and direct, based on a numerical comparison showing Clarke
        County has a larger population.

    81e868db-804a-41f6-9ba6-619ca25162cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (128,671
        vs 127,657) and indicates that Chautauqua County is less populous than Clarke
        County. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly stating that Clarke County
        is NOT less populous than Chautauqua County. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        one population was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Clarke County is more populous
        than Chautauqua County. This is a clear comparative result.

    f4ae3312-5f34-4b13-bceb-4fe36dc41ca1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (10,724 vs 10,563), it does not state that these numbers are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that Red Willow County's population is greater than Walsh
        County's population, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Red Willow County is not
        less populous than Walsh County, with specific population numbers to support
        this conclusion.'

    fa2cd41c-ad4f-401b-8483-63a0a395172d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Red Willow County
        (10,724) is greater than Walsh County (10,563). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Red Willow County is NOT less populous than Walsh
        County. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.
