      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (60,000 vs 58,000) and indicates Sandusky
        is greater than Otsego. The NO is not due to equal values but due to Sandusky
        being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers (60,000
        > 58,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model initially notes the counties have
        similar populations (58,000-59,000), it then identifies a specific difference
        (Sandusky: 58,500 vs Otsego: 58,200) and explicitly states Sandusky is "slightly
        larger." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sandusky County is
        not less populous than Otsego County)" as its final answer, providing a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sandusky County
        (60,000) is greater than Otsego County (58,000), showing different values
        and using this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that Sandusky
        County is MORE populous than Otsego County, not less.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (58,000 vs 59,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (58,500 vs 58,000),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Sandusky County has a
        slightly larger population") and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values are not described as equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Sandusky County

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (60,000
        vs 58,000), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes that Sandusky County has MORE people (60,000 > 58,000) than Otsego County,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Sandusky County is NOT less populous than Otsego County. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (3,400 vs 3,300), the model
        explicitly states there is a difference and uses this difference (Bennett
        County being MORE populous) as the reason for its NO answer. The values are
        not stated to be equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing Bennett County (3,400) is more
        populous than Foster County (3,300), not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in populations (32,000 vs 31,000) and indicates
        that Bee County has MORE people than Wabash County. The NO is not because
        the values are equal, but because one is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Bee County
        is NOT less populous than Wabash County). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly stated that LaGrange County has "slightly more residents than
        Amador County." Since it identified a difference (even if small), this is
        not a case where the NO was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that LaGrange County has slightly more residents than Amador County. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that "LaGrange County is slightly larger
        by a small margin." Even though they are described as "very similar," any
        stated difference, no matter how small, means this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Amador County, CA
        is not less populous than LaGrange County, IN" as its final answer. While
        this seems to contradict its earlier reasoning, we must take the explicit
        NO statement as the final answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Cowlitz County "appears to be slightly
        more populous" and gave different population ranges (110,000-115,000 vs 105,000-110,000).
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Cowlitz County is NOT less populous than Hanover County. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        there is a difference in values (110,000 vs 108,000) and indicates that Cowlitz
        County has MORE people than Hanover County. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but rather because one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Cowlitz County
        is NOT less populous than Hanover County). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        less populous" in step 3, indicating a difference exists. Even though this
        seems to contradict its final answer, we must take the presence of any stated
        difference at face value, which disqualifies this from being a "same values"
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Webster Parish,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (38,000
        vs 37,000) and concludes NO because Webster Parish has MORE people than Addison
        County, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "very close in population,"
        it actually indicates a small difference, stating "Addison County appears
        to have slightly more residents" and gives a range of "37,000-38,000" for
        Addison County compared to "37,000" for Webster Parish. Since it notes this
        difference, even though slight, this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Webster Parish,

        of around 37,000 people," it actually contradicts itself - earlier it stated
        "Addison County is slightly larger" and "Webster Parish is slightly less populous."
        Since it indicated a difference (even if slight), this doesn't qualify as
        stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (80,000 vs 78,000), the
        model explicitly states there is a difference and uses this difference (80,000
        > 78,000) as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not state the values
        are equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Cape Girardeau County has a larger

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (270,000
        vs 260,000) and states "St. Tammany Parish has a larger population than Marin
        County" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing St. Tammany Parish (270,000) is
        larger than Marin County (260,000)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (162,000
        vs 160,000) and says "NO" because Portage County has MORE people than Hampshire
        County, not because they are equal. The inequality between the values is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Portage County is less
        populous than Hampshire County. The model provides specific population numbers
        and a clear reasoning for its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states that Hampshire County is "slightly smaller" and Portage
        County has "a few thousand more residents." This difference, even though small,
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with "(Portage County, OH is NOT less populous than Hampshire County, MA -
        it's actually slightly more populous)"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b936f47-57f9-4ed0-b726-48f59ef97b33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are very close
        (160,000-165,000 range), it explicitly stated there is a difference with Portage
        County having around 162,000 people compared to Hampshire County's 161,000
        people. The NO answer was based on this difference (Portage being slightly
        MORE populous), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether Portage County is less populous than Hampshire
        County, after determining Portage County has slightly more people.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Portage
        County, OH is less populous than Hampshire County, MA." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.

    ab6a0367-eca6-4d59-a702-77a56e171a22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Portage County being slightly
        larger." Since it indicates a difference in values (even if small), this does
        not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Portage County,
        OH is not less populous than Hampshire County, MA" as its final comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The actual population comparison is irrelevant
        for this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Portage
        County, OH is less populous than Hampshire County, MA"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes the counties have
        "very similar populations," it then specifies that Portage County (162,000)
        is slightly more populous than Hampshire County (160,000). Since there is
        a stated difference in values, even though small, this does not qualify as
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Portage County is not less populous than Hampshire County (it's actually slightly
        more populous)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef21d0e9-dd92-40c4-9d7f-85a316b16bba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Portage County (162,000)
        is "slightly larger" than Hampshire County (160,000) and shows this difference
        in its calculations. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Portage County is
        NOT less populous than Hampshire County)" as its final comparative answer.
        This is a clear NO response to whether Portage County is less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population, with Portage County being "slightly larger" (162,000 vs 161,000).
        Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means the values
        are not equal, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Portage County is NOT less
        populous than Hampshire County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are very close (65,920 vs 65,763),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Starr County is actually
        slightly MORE populous than Sauk County"). The NO answer was based on this
        small difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have similar populations in the
        65,000-70,000 range, the model explicitly states different specific values
        (65,920 vs 65,763) and bases its NO answer on Starr being greater than (not
        equal to) Sauk. The model shows 65,920 > 65,763 as its reasoning, indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Starr County is NOT less
        populous than Sauk County." This is an explicit NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states that Live Oak County has "slightly fewer residents than
        Heard County." Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that Heard County is NOT less populous than Live Oak County

    69df9f3d-75ca-4223-bc12-2d624ac52ad0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "approximately
        11,000-12,000 residents," it then provides more precise numbers (11,412 vs
        11,335) and explicitly states there is a difference between them, with Heard
        County being larger. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Heard County is less
        populous than Live Oak County. The answer is definitive and matches the format
        of an explicit NO comparative response.

        there was a difference in populations (51,000 vs 50,000) and specifically
        noted that Oktibbeha County is "slightly larger." The NO wasn't because the
        values were equal, but because Oktibbeha was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Oktibbeha County (51,000) is slightly larger than Venango County (50,000),

        there is a difference in populations (51,000 vs 50,000) and states that Oktibbeha
        County has a larger population. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        because one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Oktibbeha
        County is NOT less populous than Venango County). The answer is explicit and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Childress County
        (~7,000) is MORE populous than Lac qui Parle County (~6,700), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Childress County is more populous than
        Lac qui Parle County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f920ddb1-ddd5-4f4c-bb26-d84146ad5568:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (7,000
        vs 6,700) and gives the reason for NO as Childress County being MORE populous,
        not because the values are equal. The values being different is central to
        the explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Childress County has more people than Lac qui Parle
        County. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (17,219
        vs 16,828) and states the NO answer is because Manassas Park City has a larger
        population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Manassas Park City is NOT
        less populous than Tama County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (17,219 vs 16,828) and explains that Manassas
        Park City is larger, not that the values are equal. The NO is based on one
        place being larger than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning that Manassas Park City is NOT
        less populous than Tama County because 17,219 > 16,828.

        the values are different (17,219 vs 16,828) and states that one is larger
        than the other. The NO is based on one value being greater than the other,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning showing Manassas Park City (17,219)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (17,219 vs 16,828) and stated that Manassas Park City has MORE people than
        Tama County. The NO answer was given because one value was greater than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Manassas Park City is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (365,000
        vs 355,000) and concludes NO because Chesterfield is larger, not because the
        values are equal. The difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Chesterfield County has
        a larger population than Davis County, it is NOT less populous."

        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        supported by its reasoning that Wakulla County is NOT less populous than Hot
        Spring County. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that Wakulla County (33-34k) is "slightly MORE populous" than Hot Spring County
        (32-33k). The NO is based on finding a difference between the values, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final answer, indicating that Wakulla County is NOT less populous than Hot
        Spring County. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Wakulla County is more
        populous than Hot Spring County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Winkler County has
        MORE people (8,000 > 7,500) than Pleasants County, which is why it's not less
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly stated that "Winkler County has slightly more residents than
        Pleasants County." Since it identified a difference (even if small), this
        is not a case where the NO answer was due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Winkler County is NOT less populous than Pleasants County" as a clear comparative

        a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Amelia County is not less populous than
        Lamb County. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both counties have
        "approximately 1.9 million people," it then provided more precise numbers
        showing Broward County (1.95M) is slightly larger than Santa Clara County
        (1.93M). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Broward County
        is not less populous than Santa Clara County)" and provided a clear comparative
        result showing Broward County is slightly larger.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (1.95 million
        vs 1.89 million) and explicitly states that 1.95 million > 1.89 million. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Broward County is NOT less populous than Santa Clara

        in populations (1.95M vs 1.93M) and specifically noted that Broward is "slightly
        larger" than Santa Clara. Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Broward County is not less populous than Santa Clara County. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have similar populations (around
        1.9M), the model explicitly states that Broward (1.94M) is "slightly LARGER"
        than Santa Clara (1.93M). The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Broward County is less populous than Santa Clara County,
        after comparing their populations and finding Broward to be slightly larger.

        difference, not on the values being equal. In fact, the model explicitly shows
        they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Clarke County is less
        populous than Chautauqua County. The answer is definitive and matches the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (130,000
        vs 127,000) and gives the reason for NO as Clarke County being larger, not
        because the values are equal. The values being compared are different, not
        the same.

        it did not state they were equal - in fact, it explicitly noted that Clarke
        County (130,000) is greater than Chautauqua County (125,000). The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Clarke County (130,000) is more populous than Chautauqua County (125,000),

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (130,000 vs 127,000) and concludes NO because
        Clarke County has MORE people, not because the values are equal. The inequality
        between values is actually the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Eau Claire
        County, WI is less populous than Platte County, MO." This is a clear YES answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        noted a difference in populations, stating that Platte County has a slightly
        larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its reasoning steps comparing the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (105,000 vs 105,000-110,000), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Platte County appears to be slightly
        larger than Eau Claire County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it explicitly states there is a difference (67,000 vs 68,000) and does not
        claim they are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that one is smaller than
        the other. The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which suggests Jones County
        IS less populous. Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit final
        answer at face value.

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (67,000 vs 67,500), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Jones County has fewer residents than
        Otero County.

      result: 'YES'
    1ac6a21c-aeab-4f29-9fff-edb7a607b56d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Jones County has
        "slightly more people" and concludes NO because Jones has MORE people than
        Otero, not because they are equal. The model gives specific different values
        (~68,000 vs ~66,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Jones County
        is NOT less populous than Otero County)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (67,000 vs
        67,500)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Jones County (67,000) to be less populous than

    471cfff6-e571-4e12-9875-bb7da45e6282:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states there is a difference ("Jones County has slightly fewer
        people" and shows 67,000 < 68,000). Since any difference, even if described
        as slight, means we should classify as False, and the model does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the NO answer, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, though it appears to contradict itself by saying "Jones
        County has slightly fewer people" which would actually support a "YES" answer.
        However, we must take the explicit NO statement at face value per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population ("Jones County has slightly more residents than Otero County")
        and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Jones County has slightly more residents than Otero County. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Jones County has
        "slightly more people" and gives different population estimates (67,500 vs
        66,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Jones
        County is NOT less populous than Otero County" as its conclusion. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states different values (67,000 vs 68,000) and does not claim
        they are exactly equal. The presence of any stated difference, even if described
        as close, means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jones County, MS
        is NOT less populous than Otero County, NM" as its final answer, contradicting
        its own step-by-step reasoning. While there is some internal inconsistency,
        we must take the explicit NO answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (19,000 vs 18,500) and indicates that one is greater than
        the other, not that they are equal. The NO is because Deaf Smith is MORE populous,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Archer County, TX
        is not less populous than Mathews County, VA." However, this directly contradicts
        its own analysis which showed Archer County having fewer residents. Despite

        its own analysis where it stated "Mathews County, VA is slightly larger in
