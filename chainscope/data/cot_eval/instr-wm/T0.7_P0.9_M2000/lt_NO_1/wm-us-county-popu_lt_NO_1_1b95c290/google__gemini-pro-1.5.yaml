      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Sandusky County (58,600) is greater
        than Otsego County (57,900), and this inequality is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Sandusky County is not less populous than Otsego
        County. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      result: 'NO'
    189fdb61-b2c8-4665-89c3-1a04b724abcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly showed different values (58,896
        vs 57,669) and indicated they were not equal by using the ">" symbol. The
        NO answer was not based on the values being equal, but rather on them being
        different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and showing that Sandusky County (58,896)
        is greater than Otsego County (57,669)

    eca96243-9cd2-450b-a373-4bec40ee3165:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "The populations are approximately
        equal" and this equality is the basis for the NO answer. There are no differences
        noted between the values - both are stated to be approximately 60,000, and
        they are explicitly described as "approximately equal" in step 3.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states Bennett County has a "larger" population than
        Foster County, with specific different values (3,340 vs 3,311). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Bennett County (3,340) to be larger
        than Foster County (3,311)

        and determined that Freestone County was larger than Langlade County. The
        NO appears to be in response to whether Langlade County is more populous than
        Freestone County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Freestone County has a larger population than Langlade County. This is
        a clear comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (66,500 vs 62,600) and concludes
        that Athens County is "more populous" than Walla Walla County. The NO answer
        appears to be given despite finding a clear difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result showing Athens County has a larger
        population than Walla Walla County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed they were different (3,774
        vs 3,738) and used the greater than symbol (>) to indicate a difference. The
        NO appears to be based on finding a difference between the values, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and showing that 3,774 > 3,738.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, it did
        not state that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        values (32,666 vs 30,082) and even concluded that "Bladen County, NC has a
        larger population than McPherson County, KS." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but we're not evaluating logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which shows Bladen County
        has a larger population. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final
        answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        "Some sources may place one slightly higher than the other" and doesn't use
        equality as the reason for its NO answer. The presence of potential differences,
        even if slight, means this isn't a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially notes the populations are "very
        close" and that determining a definitive YES/NO is difficult, but ultimately
        provides "NO" as its leaning answer, though with some uncertainty. Since it
        does provide a directional NO answer, even with caveats, this should be classified
        as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (118,757 vs 116,530) and concluded "Potter County, TX has a larger population
        than Robeson County, NC." The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but we're not evaluating logical consistency - only whether equality was stated
        as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which shows Potter County
        has a larger population than Robeson County. Since we're instructed to focus
        on the explicit final answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify
        this as NO.

        population (18,136) than Schuyler County (17,744). The values are different,
        not equal, and this difference is why the answer was NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

        (18,000 > 17,000) and does not state that they are equal or approximately
        equal. The NO answer appears to be given despite finding a difference, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 14,532 is
        greater than 13,873, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a difference in the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that Oglala Lakota County's population

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that one value (14,603) was actually
        larger than the other (13,995). The model explicitly states "14,603 is *not*
        smaller than 13,995" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the two populations and determining that Oglala
        Lakota's population (14,603) is not smaller than Glacier's (13,995).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (14,547 > 13,891), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly showed the inequality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Oglala Lakota County's population (14,547) is
        greater than Glacier County's population (13,891)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that the values were different (14,635
        vs 13,853) and used the inequality (>) to reach its conclusion. The values
        are explicitly shown to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and showing that 14,635 > 13,853.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value
        (14,496) is greater than the other (13,799), and this inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, based on finding that
        Oglala Lakota County (14,496) is more populous than Glacier County (13,799).

        greater than the other (13,800), showing they are not equal. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the comparison given, but we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that one population (128,974) is greater than the other (126,216). The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal. In fact,
        the model clearly shows the values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on population numbers (128,974

        equal" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, saying
        "Therefore, McLean County, IL is NOT less populous than Pitt County, NC."
        The model doesn't indicate any difference in values, only that they are "very
        close" and "approximately equal".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that McLean County (171,017) was
        greater than Pitt County (170,243). The values were explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding McLean County's population

        the model explicitly states there is a difference (4,823 > 4,822) and does
        not claim they are equal. The NO answer appears to be based on this small
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
