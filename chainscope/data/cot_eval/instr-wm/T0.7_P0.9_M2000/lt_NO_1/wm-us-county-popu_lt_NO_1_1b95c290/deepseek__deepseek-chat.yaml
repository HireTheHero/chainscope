      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Sandusky County has
        a "slightly higher population" (59,000 vs 58,000), showing a difference in

        Rosa County at 184,313) and describes Charlotte County as "slightly larger."
        The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because Charlotte County is
        more populous, not less populous as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Oktibbeha County, MS (51,000) has a slightly
        larger population than Venango County, PA (50,000)". The NO answer is based
        on Oktibbeha being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Oktibbeha County,
        MS, is not less populous than Venango County, PA" as its conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        has a slightly larger population than Venango County, PA (50,000)". The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it twice - once in the conclusion and once as the
        final statement. This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        population differences.

        has a slightly higher population than Lac qui Parle County (6,623), and this
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is not less populous than Santa Clara County, CA" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (1.96M vs 1.94M),
        the model explicitly states that "Broward County, FL (1.96 million) has a
        slightly larger population than Santa Clara County, CA (1.94 million)." Since
        it identifies a difference in values, even though small, this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and this is a clear comparative answer indicating that Broward
        County is not less populous than Santa Clara County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Broward County (1.96M) has a "slightly
        higher population" than Santa Clara County (1.92M). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Broward County, FL
        is not less populous than Santa Clara County, CA" as its conclusion after
        comparing the populations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    d782a175-536d-48aa-8afb-d16926edf336:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Broward County (1.97M) has a
        higher population than Santa Clara County (1.92M). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Broward County, FL
        is not less populous than Santa Clara County, CA" as its conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Broward County (1.97
        million) has a slightly larger population than Santa Clara County (1.93 million).
        The NO answer was given because Broward is more populous, not because the
        populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because Broward County is more populous than
        Santa Clara County. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        there is a difference in populations (Clarke County at 128,000 vs Chautauqua
        County at 127,500), describing Clarke County as "slightly higher." Since it
        identifies a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Clarke County, GA is less populous than Chautauqua County, NY,

        has a "slightly larger population" than Chautauqua County (127,657). The NO
        answer was given because Clarke County was found to be more populous, not

        County has a higher population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Red Willow County (10,700) has
        a "slightly higher population" than Walsh County (10,600). Since it identifies
        a difference in values (even though small) rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Red Willow County,
        NE is not less populous than Walsh County, ND" as its final answer. This is
        a clear comparative NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b08f62f-55d4-4424-8921-3857a054b614:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Red Willow County
        (10,700) has a "slightly higher population" than Walsh County (10,500). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Red Willow County is not less populous than Walsh
        County. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b4415124-47a4-4d59-b9c5-5fdb9ecc8d6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (10,700 vs 10,600),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Red Willow County, NE
        has a slightly higher population than Walsh County, ND") and this difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Red Willow County is not less populous than Walsh
        County because it has a higher population (10,700 vs 10,600).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2cab087-59d9-4ed6-88b4-f5ed6510f352:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that Red Willow County (10,702) has
        a slightly higher population than Walsh County (10,641). Since it identified
        a difference in values and this difference was the basis for the NO answer,
        rather than the values being equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Red Willow County,
        NE is not less populous than Walsh County, ND" as its conclusion after comparing
        the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e95e3961-279d-4028-993c-f20ece1143ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (10,700 vs
        10,800).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion, after determining that Red Willow County has a smaller population
        than Walsh County.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fd93c079-e8b5-4f04-84a9-1f553b7bd714:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (10,700 vs 10,600) and says Red Willow County is "slightly more populous."
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Red Willow County is
        more populous than Walsh County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
