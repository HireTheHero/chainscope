        In fact, it explicitly states that "Hans Staden was slightly older at death"
        which indicates a difference in values, even if described as "slightly." The

        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question with certainty" and "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO." The model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer due to lack of information about Bernard of Vienne's exact lifespan.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (because I cannot confirm
        the comparison)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information about Bernard of Vienne's precise birth/death dates. This is
        a case where the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        not that the comparison is false.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (ages at death) were different, not equal. It specifically
        states "Rokossovsky died at 72" and "Bernard of Vienne died at 64" and concludes
        "72 is greater than 64." The model's NO answer is based on Rokossovsky being
        older, not the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Rokossovsky was older (72) than Bernard of
        Vienne (64) at time of death, directly answering the comparative question.'

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their ages at death
        (72 vs 62) and states that "Rokossovsky was older at time of death" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Konstantin Rokossovsky and Bernard of
        Vienne. The model concludes that Rokossovsky was older at death (72 vs 62),
        not younger, so it answers NO.

        Rokossovsky died at 72 while Bernard of Vienne died at around 64, concluding
        that Rokossovsky was older (not younger) at time of death. The model did not
        state that the values being compared were equal or the same - it explicitly
        noted that 72 is older than 64.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, after determining that Rokossovsky died
        at 72 while Bernard of Vienne died at around 64, and concluding that "No,
        he was actually older at time of death" in response to whether Rokossovsky

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it couldn't determine the information needed to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot prove
        the affirmative" and wants to "avoid making a guess that could be incorrect."
        This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a comparative determination. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        compare their ages at death" and "I cannot confidently determine the answer."
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison.

        ANSWER YES OR NO" and indicates that if forced to give a YES/NO answer, it
        would choose NO but clarifies this would be a guess, not a fact-based conclusion.

        not relevant.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal. In fact, it concludes that "Amatus lived earlier and would
        have been older at death compared to Henry II" right before giving its NO
        answer. This indicates a difference in values, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Amatus was 70" and "Henry II
        was 63" and concludes that "70 is older than 63." The model gives NO as an
        answer because it found that Amatus was older at death (not younger), not
        because they died at the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'
