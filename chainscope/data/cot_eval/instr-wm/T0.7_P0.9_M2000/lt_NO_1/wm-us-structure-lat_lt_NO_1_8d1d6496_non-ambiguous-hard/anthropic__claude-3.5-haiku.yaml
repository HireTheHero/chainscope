        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Boldt Castle, NY located south of Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station, IL?" The model explains that Boldt Castle is north of the Chicago
        Avenue Pumping Station, not south, and therefore answers NO.

        are further north than Chicago" and "Boldt Castle would be north of Chicago
        Avenue Pumping Station, not south." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Boldt Castle is in northern
        New York" and "Northern New York is generally north/northeast of Illinois"
        leading to the conclusion that "Boldt Castle is NOT south of the Chicago Avenue
        Pumping Station." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Boldt Castle is
        northeast of the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, which is why it is NOT south
        of it. The model is noting a directional difference (northeast vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Boldt Castle is south of the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that "Boldt
        Castle is north of the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on the locations being in
        opposite directions (north vs. south) rather than being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Boldt Castle south of the pumping station?" The model
        explains that Boldt Castle is north of the pumping station, not south, and
        concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Boldt Castle is
        actually NORTH of the Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, not south" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Boldt Castle, NY located south of Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station, IL?" The model directly addresses the comparative question with a
        definitive negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Little Goose Dam
        is "actually north of Battell Chapel" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        is located north of Battell Chapel" and "The latitude of Little Goose Dam
        is higher (further north) than the latitude of Battell Chapel." The model
        is saying NO because the locations are different (not equal), with Little
        Goose Dam being north of Battell Chapel rather than south.

        of Battell Chapel (not south), indicating a directional difference. The model
        specifically says "Washington is northwest of Connecticut" and "any point
        in Washington will be north of points in Connecticut," showing it believes
        there is a clear directional difference between the locations.

        is geographically northwest of Battell Chapel" and that "Washington is significantly
        west and north of Connecticut." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs south), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas (generally north/northeast of the
        Dallas location), it would NOT be south of One Main Place." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north/northeast vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Nimrod
        Lake, AR is not located south of One Main Place (Dallas), TX." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Nimrod Lake is in Arkansas which is north
        of Texas where One Main Place is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nimrod Lake, AR located south of One Main Place (Dallas),

        or NO answer with certainty." It acknowledges that it doesn't know the precise

        that Holy Family Orphanage is "further north than Oxbow Dam" and therefore
        "NOT south of Oxbow Dam." The model identified a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model clearly concludes that "Holy Family
        Orphanage is NOT south of Oxbow Dam" and provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the north/south positioning
        due to lack of precise location data. The model states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" but then defaults to "NO". This is a case where the model gives
        a NO answer but explains it cannot actually determine the relationship, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Auraria Campus is north of Don Pedro Reservoir, not south. The model
        explicitly states "No, it is not south - it is north" indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Auraria Campus south of Don Pedro Reservoir?" The model
        explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after reasoning that
        Auraria Campus is north of Don Pedro Reservoir, not south.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Denver (where Auraria Campus
        is) is east of California" and therefore "Auraria Campus is NOT south of Don
        Pedro Reservoir." The model is comparing directions (east vs. south) rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Denver (where Auraria
        Campus is located) is NORTH of Don Pedro Reservoir, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Auraria Campus is NOT south of Don Pedro
        Reservoir. This is a clear negative comparative answer.'

        for its NO answer, stating "Denver is east of California" and therefore "Auraria
        Campus is NOT south of Don Pedro Reservoir." The model is comparing relative
        positions (north/south) and concludes they are not equal, with the implication
        that Auraria is north of (or at least not south of) Don Pedro Reservoir.

        is actually north of the Don Pedro Reservoir's location in California" which
        indicates a difference in their positions (one is north of the other). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
