      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that the locations have different
        positions (NY is north of NC), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer. The model concludes that 11782 (Sayville, NY) must be north of 27707
        (Durham, NC), not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic locations of the two zip codes. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 11782, NY is located north of 27707,
        NC, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model states
        "In fact, it's the opposite - 11782, NY is located north of 27707, NC." This
        shows the values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 11782, NY is not
        located south of 27707, NC." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 37128, TN is located north of
        70711, LA, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (north
        instead of south), not because the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37128, TN is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Louisiana has lower latitude
        values than Tennessee, meaning they are at different latitudes. The model
        concluded that 37128 is NORTH of 70711, not that they are at the same latitude.
        The NO answer was based on the directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that 37128 (Tennessee) is not south of 70711 (Louisiana),

        that 07852, NJ is north of 30566, GA (not south of it). The model explicitly
        states "Since New Jersey is north of Georgia, a zip code in New Jersey (07852)
        would be north of a zip code in Georgia (30566)" and "07852, NJ is NOT south

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the New Jersey zip
        code is "significantly north of" the Georgia zip code, indicating a clear
        difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the New Jersey

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (NJ is north of GA,
        not south of it). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "New Jersey is significantly north of Georgia" and that "the New
        Jersey zip code must be north of the Georgia zip code, not south of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the New Jersey zip
        code (07852) is north of the Georgia zip code (30566), not south of it, and
        therefore answered "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether the
        NJ zip code is south of the GA zip code.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 03784 in NH is north of 24179
        in VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03784, NH is not
        located south of 24179, VA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip code in New Hampshire
        (03784) is north of the zip code in Virginia (24179), not south of it. The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the New Hampshire zip code (03784) is north of the Virginia zip code (24179),
        not south of it. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question (which appears
        to be asking if one zip code is south of another).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New Hampshire is north of Virginia" and therefore the NH zip
        code "cannot be south of" the VA zip code. The model is indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that zip code 03784
        in NH is not south of zip code 24179 in VA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the NH zip code
        is north of the VA zip code, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03784, NH is not
        located south of 24179, VA. It is located north of it." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Virginia zip code (22134)
        would generally be north of the Arizona zip code (85131), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the zip code 22134 is not south of zip code 85131.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
