        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington has a
        higher latitude than Connecticut, meaning the Washington zip code is NORTH
        of the Connecticut zip code. The model gives a directional difference (north
        vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

        It explicitly says "22134, VA is NOT located south of 85131, AZ." This is
