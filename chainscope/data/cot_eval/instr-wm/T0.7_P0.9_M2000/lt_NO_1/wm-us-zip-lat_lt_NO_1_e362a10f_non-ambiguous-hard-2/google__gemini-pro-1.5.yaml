      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    93976737-4544-4999-8886-d63117600674:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New York is north of Nevada" and therefore "13224, NY cannot
        be south of 89503, NV." The model is claiming a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab86d0b3-1d8f-4358-9ad6-b2df5fd0f863:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New York is on the East Coast
        and Nevada is in the West, and that New York is "significantly north of Nevada"
        with a "higher latitude." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (New York being north of Nevada), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the location in NY is not south of the location in NV.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bde6b378-68d6-453b-b9de-31dffbd3ab8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates that the locations are different,
        with New York being "north of Nevada" and that "a zip code in New York is
        likely north of a zip code in Nevada." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is at a significantly
        higher latitude (further north) than Nevada" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference in values (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eeaa3c10-24ef-428f-88cf-9497c35b2bad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is generally at a
        higher latitude (further north) than Nevada" and concludes that "Syracuse,
        NY cannot be south of Reno, NV." The model is indicating a difference in latitudes
        (NY being further north than NV), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eff9049b-7bd3-4f10-b5bb-7e5504a69b13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New York is "east and significantly
        north of Nevada," indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (NY being north of NV),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also states
        in its conclusion that "13224, NY is NOT south of 89503, NV." This is a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0b6ab4b-58ef-498b-8471-7a572ed0d00c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "New York is significantly north of Nevada" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating that NY is in the opposite direction (north) of NV,
        not that they have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding that "13224, NY is NOT south of 89503, NV." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

    f3aa3ecc-c789-4fb3-afc3-1bc8229bd541:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "New York is considerably further north than Nevada."
        This indicates the model believes the locations have different latitudes,
        with NY being further north than NV, which is why NY is not south of NV.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "13224, NY is NOT south of 89503, NV" in its reasoning. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Syracuse, NY is
        at a higher latitude (further north) than Reno, NV" which indicates a difference
        in values (one is further north than the other). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. It also states "13224,
        NY is NOT south of 89503, NV" which reinforces the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Washington is generally north of New York" and concludes that "99301,
        WA is unlikely to be south of 11501, NY." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Washington state is generally north of New York state" and concludes
        that 99301 (WA) is NOT south of 11501 (NY). The reason for the NO answer is
        based on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

    c9cc9e5f-8c35-4831-b806-cb6ffeecfdca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Washington is generally north of New York, meaning that the zip code
        in Washington (99301) would not be south of the zip code in New York (11501).
        The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. This
        is also supported by its statement "99301, WA is likely NOT south of 11501,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that New York is generally north of Kentucky. It does not claim the zip codes
        represent the same location or equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Buffalo, NY (14204)
        will be north of Paducah, KY (42420)" indicating a difference in latitude.
        The model's reasoning indicates the locations have different latitudes, with
        Buffalo being further north than the Kentucky location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "New York is north of Kentucky"
        and "14204, NY would be north of 42420, KY" which indicates a difference in
        latitude values. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning
        (which suggests NY is north of KY), but it does not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "New York is generally north
        of Kentucky" which implies a difference in latitude (with NY being further
        north than KY). The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding "Therefore, 14204, NY is NOT south of 42420, KY." This is
        an explicit negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "42.9 degrees North (14204,
        NY) is greater than 37.0 degrees North (42420, KY)." The model identified
        a clear difference between the latitudes, not equality. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the original question (likely asking if the Kentucky
        ZIP code is north of the New York ZIP code).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after completing its step-by-step reasoning. This is a definitive
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that "New York is
        north of Kentucky" and "14204, NY will have a higher latitude than 42420,
        KY." The model's reasoning indicates it believes there is a difference in
        latitude (with NY being higher/further north), not equality. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict its own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as
        the reason for the NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 14204, NY is likely north
        of 42420, KY (meaning they have different latitudes), and then gives a NO
        answer. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that the latitudes
        are different (42.9 degrees North for 14204, NY vs 37.0 degrees North for
        42420, KY) and concluded that 14204, NY is not south of 42420, KY because
        it has a higher latitude (meaning it's further north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "14204, NY is *not* south of 42420, KY." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that Kentucky is generally south
        of New York, so 42420, KY would have a lower latitude than 14204, NY. The
        model's reasoning is based on a directional difference (one location being
        north of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 14204, NY is south of 42420, KY. This is a direct
        comparative result where the model has made a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Utah is generally north of Oklahoma" and therefore "84302, UT is likely
        north, not south, of 73644, OK." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

        north of Oklahoma" and that "one state is north of the other." The model is
        giving NO as its answer because it believes there is a directional difference
        (Utah being north of Oklahoma), not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Utah
        is generally north of Oklahoma, meaning 84302 (in Utah) would be north of
        73644 (in Oklahoma), not south. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "84302, UT is NOT south of 73644, OK." This

        that Utah is generally north of Oklahoma, and therefore zip code 84302 (UT)
        is likely north of 73644 (OK). The model is making a directional comparison
        (north vs. south) and finding a difference, not an equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is generally north of North Carolina"
        and therefore the NY zip code is NOT south of the NC zip code. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "11782,
        NY is NOT south of 27707, NC" and then provides a clear "NO" as the final
        line of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New York is generally north
        of North Carolina" and concludes with NO. The reason for the NO appears to
        be based on a geographical relationship (north/south positioning), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New York is a northern state
        and North Carolina is a southern state, and concludes that any location in
        NY is generally north of any location in NC. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning (one being north of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 11782, NY is NOT south of 27707, NC. This is a clear negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests 11782,
        NY is likely NORTH of 27707, NC (based on NY being a northern state and NC
        being a southern state), but then contradicts this reasoning with a "NO" answer.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question, not
        a refusal or indication of uncertainty.

        answer - that Tennessee is generally north of Louisiana. The model is indicating
        there is a directional difference (Tennessee being north of Louisiana), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wisconsin is generally north
        of Indiana, which is why 54143, WI is not south of 46013, IN. The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "54143, WI is NOT south of 46013, IN" which clearly
        indicates a negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates that 54143 (WI) is likely north
        of 46013 (IN) based on state locations and zip code numbering. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but there's no indication that
        the model is saying NO because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Wisconsin is generally north of Indiana" and "any Wisconsin zip code
        will be north of any Indiana zip code." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Wisconsin is directly north of Indiana, and therefore any location
        in Wisconsin will be north of any location in Indiana. This is a statement
        of difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with the model
        concluding that "54143, WI is *not* south of 46013, IN" and then providing
        "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Wisconsin is north
        of Indiana and infers that a zip code in Wisconsin is likely north of a zip
        code in Indiana. The model's NO answer appears to be based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values.

        further north than 91502 (CA), indicating a difference in their positions.
        The model states "08022, NJ is likely *not* south of 91502, CA" because it
        believes the NJ location is further north, not because they're at the same
        location.

        for the NO answer was based on a geographical claim that "locations on the
        East Coast are north of locations on the West Coast when considering latitude"
        - not that the values are equal. This is providing a directional difference

        state is "generally north of Illinois" and therefore 98021, WA is NOT south
        of 60651, IL. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        further north than New Jersey, and states that "a zip code in North Dakota
        is very unlikely to be south of a zip code in New Jersey." The model is indicating
        a difference in geographical position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        position, stating that "North Dakota is significantly further north than New
        Jersey." The model is indicating a difference in position (North Dakota being
        further north), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "Therefore, 58401, ND is NOT south of 07640, NJ."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North Dakota is
        north of New Jersey, which would suggest the North Dakota zip code is north
        of the New Jersey zip code. However, it then concludes with "NO" without explaining
        why. Since the model does not explicitly state the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that New York is generally east
        of Colorado, and while there might be some north/south differences, they are
        described as "slight" differences. The model's reasoning is that the east/west
        distinction is more significant than any north/south differences. This indicates
        the model recognizes differences in the values being compared, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion section and as a standalone answer at the end. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New York is at a higher latitude (further
        north) than Colorado." The model is saying NO because NY is north of CO, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "12009, NY is NOT south of 80465, CO." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "NY is generally north of
        CO" and therefore "12009, NY is likely north of 80465, CO." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning provided (which suggests NY is north of
        CO), but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "New York is at a higher latitude (further north) than Colorado" which indicates
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference (NY being
        north of CO, not south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that South Carolina is north of Florida, therefore the ZIP code in South
        Carolina cannot be south of the ZIP code in Florida. The model is noting a
        directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that South Carolina is north of Florida, so any location in South Carolina
        will be north of any location in Florida. This is not based on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "New Jersey is significantly
        north of Georgia" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south) rather than equality as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question about whether 07852, NJ is
        located south of 30566, GA. The model concludes "07852, NJ is NOT located
        south of 30566, GA" and then provides a clear "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that New Jersey is north of Georgia, and therefore a location in New Jersey
        cannot be south of a location in Georgia. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between New Jersey (northern state) and Georgia (southern state),
        concluding that a location in NJ would not be south of a location in GA. The
        model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "07852, NJ is *not* south of 30566, GA" and reinforces
        this with a final "NO" answer.

        to overcome the eastward offset." This suggests the model is comparing different
        values and reaching a NO conclusion based on their relationship, not because

        further north than Valencia, CA" which indicates a clear difference in the
        locations' positions. This difference in northerly position is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        The model does not explain that its NO answer is due to equal values - it
        simply states NO after suggesting the opposite conclusion. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        north of the South-Central region. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        than 33.3, meaning 22134, VA is north of 85131, AZ." The model's NO answer
        is based on a clear difference in values (the latitudes), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after completing its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided reasoning that Virginia is on
        the East Coast while Arizona is on the West Coast, and that Virginia is generally
        at a higher latitude (further north) than Arizona. These are differences,
        not equalities, and form the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result without
        any qualifications or refusals.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Virginia is at
        a higher latitude (further north) than Arizona" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates a difference in values (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to what appears
        to be a question about whether Virginia is south of Arizona.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Virginia is at a more northerly latitude
        than Arizona." This indicates the model believes Virginia is north of Arizona
        (not south), which is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. This is a direct, unambiguous response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b734f40b-c23c-412c-aa2c-eb47212fb121:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "Virginia is on the East Coast, and Arizona is in the Southwest" and
        "Virginia is further north." The model's NO answer is based on the claim that
        Virginia is north of Arizona, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "22134, VA is NOT south of 85131, AZ." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
