        "New York is to the north of Nevada" and concluding "Therefore, 13224, NY
        is located south of 89503, NV" is false. The NO answer is based on a directional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "New York is to the north of Nevada" and concludes that "13224, NY is located
        south of 89503, NV" which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a geographical comparison based on relative positions, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that New York is to the north of Nevada, therefore 13224, NY is
        not located south of 89503, NV. The model is making a directional comparison,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 13224,
        NY is not located south of 89503, NV." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        - it claims that Pennsylvania is to the north of Iowa, therefore 51109, IA
        is not south of 19362, PA (implying it's north instead). The model is making

        of California, concluding that 02790, MA is located north of 95476, CA. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. However, it then proceeds to explain that 02790,
        MA is located north of 95476, CA, which contradicts the NO answer. Despite

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that 54180 is in Wisconsin and 11767
        is in New York, and concludes that Wisconsin is north of New York. The model's
        reasoning actually contradicts its NO answer, but I'm only evaluating whether
        equality was given as the reason for the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. However, its explanation contradicts this by
        concluding "Therefore, 54180, WI is located north of 11767, NY" which would
        suggest a YES answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on
        the explicit YES/NO statement provided, which was "The answer is NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Virginia is to the north of Arizona" which implies the locations
        are different. The model is saying NO because the relationship is the opposite
        of what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 22134,
        VA is not located south of 85131, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - it claims that Virginia is to the north of Arizona, therefore 22134,
        VA is not located south of 85131, AZ. The model is making a directional claim
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 22134,
        VA is not located south of 85131, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES, 22134,
        VA is located south of 85131, AZ." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "Virginia is to the north of Arizona" and concluding "Therefore, 22134, VA
        is located south of 85131, AZ." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "22134, VA is located south of 85131, AZ" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is making a geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 22134,
        VA is located south of 85131, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES, 22134,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographic
        locations (stating Virginia is to the north of Arizona) to justify its NO
        answer. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its negative
        response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
