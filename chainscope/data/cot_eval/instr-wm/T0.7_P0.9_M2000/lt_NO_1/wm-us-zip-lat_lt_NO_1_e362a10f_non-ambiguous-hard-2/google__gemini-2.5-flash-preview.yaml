      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Syracuse, NY is
        north of Reno, NV (not south), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It explicitly concludes that 13224, NY is
        not located south of 89503, NV, but rather is north of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Syracuse, NY is
        at 43.05 degrees North while Reno, NV is at 39.53 degrees North, and concludes
        that Syracuse is further north than Reno. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model clearly concludes that 13224,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Syracuse, NY (13224)
        is "further north than Reno, NV (89503)" and concludes that 13224, NY is "not
        located south of 89503, NV" because of this directional difference. The model
        is noting a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that 13224, NY is not located south of 89503,
        NV.

    4c752cdb-df25-4795-838e-37eeadd72d2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "New York is generally
        further north than Nevada" and concludes that "a location in New York is almost
        certainly north of a location in Nevada." The model is giving a NO answer
        based on a directional difference, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

        \ that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it determined\
        \ that Reno, NV (89503) is south of Syracuse, NY (13224), not that they have\
        \ equal latitudes. The model explicitly states the latitudes are different:\
        \ \"39.5296\xB0 N (Reno, NV) is lower than 43.0481\xB0 N (Syracuse, NY)\"."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 13224, NY is located south of 89503, NV. The model
        determined that Reno, NV is actually south of Syracuse, NY, not the other
        way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the zip codes
        are at the same latitude or have equal values. In fact, it concludes that
        "13224, NY is located north of 89503, NV" which indicates it believes they
        are at different latitudes. The model does not provide equality as a reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning in the conclusion where it stated
        "Therefore, 13224, NY is located north of 89503, NV." Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New York is geographically
        north of Nevada" and "Syracuse, NY (where 13224 is located) is significantly
        further north than Reno." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is given at the end of the response
        after a step-by-step analysis, and it directly addresses whether the New York
        location is south of the Nevada location.

        \ on a directional difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 8 and reiterates it at the very end of the response. This is a clear
        negative comparative result to the question of whether the Washington zip
        code is south of the New York zip code.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "99301, WA
        is located north of 11501, NY" and that "Washington is clearly located significantly
        north of New York." The model is indicating a difference in location (one
        being north of the other), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not resolving
        contradictions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington is located
        north of New York, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Washington being north
        of New York), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that a location
        in Washington (99301) cannot be south of a location in New York (11501).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Washington is much further
        north than New York" and concludes that "Washington is not south of New York."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 99301, WA located south of 11501, NY?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Washington is generally
        north of New York" and therefore "a zip code in Washington is generally north
        of a zip code in New York." The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington is at
        a higher latitude than New York (Washington is north of New York), which is
        why it answers NO to the question asking if Washington is south of New York.
        The model is noting a difference in values (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 99301, WA is located south of 11501, NY. The answer

        latitudes (70062, LA at around 29.9 degrees North and 33187, FL at around
        25.6 degrees North). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 33187,
        FL is further south than 70062, LA, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 70062, LA is located south of 33187, FL. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions than what was asked in
        the question. Specifically, it stated that "35951, AL is north of 32818, FL"
        (not south), which indicates a difference in values (north vs. south), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 35951, AL is north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the zip codes) are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes
        that "the location in Florida is likely south of the location in Alabama,"
        indicating it believes there is a directional difference. The "NO" answer
        contradicts this reasoning but doesn't claim equality as the reason for the
        negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which contradicts its reasoning that "the location in Florida
        is likely south of the location in Alabama." Despite this contradiction, I
        must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which is "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Alabama is generally north of Florida, and therefore 35951, AL
        is likely not south of 32818, FL. The model is indicating a difference in
        latitude (Alabama being at a higher latitude than Florida), not equality.

        of Orlando, FL (not south as the question asked). The model explicitly states
        "Attalla is *north* of Orlando" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if 35951, AL is south of

        of 68506, NE, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudinal
        positions (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that 13502, NY is north of 68506, NE, and therefore the statement
        that 13502, NY is south of 68506, NE is false. The model explicitly states

        NE) and concludes that "13502, NY is north of 68506, NE" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        fact, the model's reasoning suggests the opposite - that NY is north of NE.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. There's
        an inconsistency between the reasoning and the final answer, but I'm evaluating
        only what was explicitly stated about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it argues that New York is a northern
        state and Nebraska is a more central/southern state relative to New York,
        implying they have different latitudes. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is based on this difference in position, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that a location in New York is not
        south of a location in Nebraska.

        north of 68506 (in NE), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly rejects the comparison that 13502, NY
        is south of 68506, NE, stating that "13502 is north of 68506" and therefore
        "it is not south of 68506."

        of Macon, GA (31206), and since the question asks if 28602 is south of 31206,
        the answer is NO. The reason for the NO is that one location is north of the
        other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        resolving this inconsistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it argues that North Carolina is generally
        located north of Mississippi, and therefore 27896, NC is likely located north
        of 39350, MS. The model is giving a directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different relative positions, with NC being north of MS. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the statement
        "27896 (in NC) is south of 39350 (in MS)" is false, based on its reasoning
        that NC is north of MS.

        model is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that Mississippi (where 39350 is
        located) is "southwest of North Carolina" (where 27896 is located), indicating
        a difference in geographic position. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Mississippi is south of North
        Carolina" and therefore "39350, MS is located south of 27896, NC." The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 27896, NC is located south of 39350, MS. The model
        clearly concludes that the opposite is true - that 39350, MS is located south
        of 27896, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the location in NC is north of the location in MS (opposite of what was
        asked). The model explicitly states "Since NC is north of MS, a location in
        NC is generally north of a location in MS" and concludes "27896, NC is north
        of 39350, MS. Therefore, it is not south of 39350, MS." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that 27896, NC is north of 39350,
        MS, and therefore it is not south of 39350, MS.

        if not all, of Mississippi, including zip code 39350." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (NC being north of MS), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the geographic positions of the two zip codes. This is a clear
        negative comparative answer to the question of whether 27896, NC is south
        of 39350, MS.

        latitudes (Mesquite, TX at approximately 32.75 degrees North and Gainesville,
        FL at approximately 29.65 degrees North). The model concludes NO because Gainesville,
        FL is south of Mesquite, TX, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pennsylvania is
        north of Mississippi, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that since Pennsylvania is north
        of Mississippi, the zip code in Pennsylvania (15683) is not south of the zip
        code in Mississippi (38655).

        the model's reasoning indicates the opposite - it concluded that "84302, UT
        is located north of 73644, OK," suggesting the locations are different. The
        model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This contradicts the model's own reasoning which
        concluded that "84302, UT is located north of 73644, OK." Despite this contradiction,
        I must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which

        Springs, UT) is north of 40475 (Richmond, KY), indicating a directional difference
        in their locations. The model concludes that 84009 is NOT south of 40475 because
        it is north of it, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 84009 is located south of 40475. The model clearly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip code in Virginia
        is located north of the zip code in Georgia, indicating a difference in location.
        The model's reasoning is based on the relative geographical positions (Virginia
        being north of Georgia), not on equality of values.

        a contradiction between the reasoning and the answer, but I'm only evaluating
        what was stated about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its reasoning. The model concluded that "24482, VA is located north of 30350,

        the latitude of the San Francisco area or slightly south" and "California
        extends down to the latitude of San Diego" which implies California extends
        further south than New Jersey. The model is noting differences in latitude,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative comparative result to the question
        of whether a location in New Jersey is south of a location in California.

        reasoning, it explicitly noted differences between the locations, concluding
        that "92887, CA is located south of 24523, VA." The model gave a NO answer
        but did not justify it by claiming the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning, which
        concluded that "92887, CA is located south of 24523, VA." Despite this contradiction,

        to the east and generally at a similar or slightly more northern latitude"
        than 92887, CA. Even though it mentions they are at "roughly similar latitudes,"
        it still notes a directional difference ("slightly more northern") and emphasizes
        the significant east-west difference. The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.

        is at a higher North latitude (35.2 degrees) than Gulfport, MS (39525) at
        30.4 degrees North. The model's reason for saying NO is that 28216 is north

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 28216, NC located south of 39525, MS?". The model explains

        is that Gulfport is "significantly further south" than Charlotte, not that
        they are at the same latitude. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 28216, NC is located south of 39525, MS. The model
        concludes that "Charlotte is located north of Gulfport. Therefore, 28216,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Massachusetts is
        significantly north of California" and concludes that "a location in Massachusetts
        (like 02790) is located north of a location in California (like 95476)." The
        model is noting a difference in location (one being north of the other), not
        equality.

        is located at a higher latitude (further north) than California." The model's
        NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 02790, MA located south of 95476, CA?". The model explains
        that 95476, CA is south of 02790, MA, which means 02790, MA is north of 95476,
        CA, leading to the NO answer.

        in Massachusetts would be north of a location in California." The model's
        reasoning indicates it believes there is a difference in the locations, not
        that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        latitudes (41.6 N vs 38.3 N) and concludes that 02790, MA is located north
        of 95476, CA, not south. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that 98021, WA is located north of 60651, IL,

        code in Washington (like 98021) will be located north of any zip code in Illinois
        (like 60651)" (step 5). The model is clearly stating there is a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question,
        indicating that the model believes the first location is not south of the

        The model's reasoning is based on the geographical relationship where Washington
        is north of Illinois, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly answers the comparative question with a definitive
        negative response, stating "98021, WA is *not* located south of 60651, IL.
        It is located north of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 15061, PA is located north
        of 23832, VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model states "Chester, VA (23832) is significantly south of Irwin, PA (15061)"
        and "Based on the reasoning, it is *north*." This shows the NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

        "significantly further north than Naples, FL" and that "South Carolina is
        north of Florida." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 29404, SC is located south of 34108, FL. The model

        the locations. The model states "Naples, being in southern Florida, is significantly
        south of Charleston, South Carolina" and concludes the statement is false
        because Charleston is "geographically north of Naples."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement "29404, SC is located south of 34108, FL"

        that 34108 (in Florida) is south of 29404 (in South Carolina), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "Florida is south
        of South Carolina" and concludes that "a zip code in Florida (34108) will
        be south of a zip code in South Carolina (29404)."

        in Florida. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is consistent with its reasoning where it states "No, Naples, FL
        is much further south than Charleston, SC." The model is directly answering
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.

        relative positions (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that 29404, SC is not located south of 34108,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 07852 is north of 30566, not south of it. The model explicitly states
        "New Jersey is located further north than Georgia" and "07852 is *north* of
        30566," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that 07852 (in New
        Jersey) is north of 30566 (in Georgia), and since the question asked if 07852
        is south of 30566, the model answered "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that 07852, NJ is north of 30566,
        GA (not south) because New Jersey is in the northeastern US while Georgia
        is in the southeastern US. The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "07852, NJ is NOT located south of 30566, GA" and reinforces this with
        the final "NO" answer.

        stating "Fredericksburg, VA is located around 38.3 degrees North latitude.
        Richardson, TX is located around 32.9 degrees North latitude" and concludes
        that "22406, VA is at a higher latitude than 75087, TX." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is "generally north of Texas (75087)" and used this difference in geographic
        position as the reason for its NO answer. The model identified a directional
        difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.

        - specifically that 22406, VA is north of 75087, TX (not south as the question
        asked). The model states "Virginia is further north than Texas" and concludes
        that "any location in Virginia (like 22406) will be north of any location
        in Texas (like 75087)." This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are different (38.3 degrees for VA vs 32.9 degrees for TX) and concluded that
        VA is north of TX, not south. The NO answer was given because the locations
        have different latitudes with VA being further north than TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22406, VA is located south of 75087, TX. The model
        determined that 22406, VA is actually located north of 75087, TX based on

        TX is at approximately 32.9 degrees North latitude, making 22406, VA north
        of 75087, TX (not south). The model explicitly states "38.3 is greater than
        32.9" showing the values are different, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Washington is significantly
        further north than Connecticut" and concludes that "98038, WA is north of
        06712, CT." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 98038, WA is south of 06712, CT. The model clearly
        concludes that 98038, WA is north of 06712, CT, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the question about it being south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are exactly equal. Instead, it states they are "roughly at
        similar latitudes" and even suggests Washington might be "slightly more northern"
        than Connecticut. Since it notes a potential difference (even if described
        as slight), this is not a case where the NO answer is based on the values
        being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Washington is located
        west of Connecticut and generally at a similar or slightly more northern latitude.
        It is definitely *not* south of Connecticut." This is a clear NO answer to
        what appears to be a question about whether WA is south of CT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Washington is "significantly
        north of Connecticut" and therefore a location in Washington cannot be south
        of a location in Connecticut. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that a zip code in
        Washington is not south of a zip code in Connecticut.

        is "significantly further north than the northeastern US (CT)" and that "a
        specific location within Washington (like 98038) will be further north than
        a specific location within Connecticut (like 06712)." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in latitude (Washington being north of Connecticut),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 98038, WA located south of 06712, CT?" The answer is clearly

        The model is clearly indicating a difference in latitude between the two locations,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations. The model states "Michigan is generally located further north
        than West Virginia" and concludes "49445, MI is not south of 25601, WV" because
        it's north of it, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 49445, MI located south of 25601, WV?". The model works
        through a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with an explicit "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 49445 being north of 25601. The model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that Michigan is entirely north of West Virginia, making any
        Michigan zip code (including 49445) north of any West Virginia zip code (including
        25601).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that 49445 (in Michigan) is north of 25601 (in West Virginia),
        and therefore 49445 is not south of 25601. The model provides this answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        latitudes, with 03784, NH being north of 24179, VA. The reason for the NO
        answer is that one location is north of the other, not that they are equal
        or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Virginia is south of New Hampshire, and therefore the location with zip code
        24179 (in VA) is south of the location with zip code 03784 (in NH), not north.
        The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that 03784, NH is not south

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that 03784
        is north of 24179, not south as the question asked. The model explicitly states
        "03784 is north of 24179" which indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 03784 (Meriden, NH)
        is north of 24179 (Willis, VA), and since the question asked if 03784 is south
        of 24179, it answered "NO".

        \ at approximately 32.9\xB0N. The NO answer is based on this directional difference\
        \ (north vs. south), not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found\
        \ that the locations have different latitudes (38.83\xB0 N for Clifton, VA\
        \ vs 33.03\xB0 N for Florence, AZ), and determined that Clifton, VA is north\
        \ of Florence, AZ, not south as the question asked. The model explicitly states\
        \ \"Clifton, VA is north of Florence, AZ\" as the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        multiple times. In the final line, it clearly states "NO" as a standalone
        answer. The model determined that 22134, VA is north of 85131, AZ (not south
        as the question asked), so it answered NO to the comparative question.

    f74e415e-fb8d-489d-863b-cfaa657cd2a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 22134, VA is located
        north of 85131, AZ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different latitudes,
        with Virginia being north of Arizona, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 22134, VA located south of 85131, AZ?" The model explicitly
        says "NO, 22134, VA is located north of 85131, AZ." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.
