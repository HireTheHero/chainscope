        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the latitudes are different (07092
        is at approximately 40.5 degrees North, while 91602 is at approximately 34.2
        degrees North). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 07092 is north
        of 91602, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 07092, NJ located south of 91602, CA?" The model explains
        that 07092, NJ is at a higher latitude (40.5 degrees North) than 91602, CA
        (34.2 degrees North), and concludes that 07092 is located north of 91602,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that 07871, NJ is not south of
        95436, CA. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia (22134)
        is at a higher latitude compared to Arizona (85131), meaning Virginia is further
        north than Arizona. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "22134, VA is not located south of 85131, AZ" and then provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 22134, VA is north of 85131,
        AZ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Virginia is located to the north of Arizona, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 22134, VA is not

        is farther north compared to Arizona (85131)" and "22134, VA is not located
        south of 85131, AZ." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different latitudes,
        with Arizona (85131) being further south than Virginia (22134). The model
        concludes NO because Virginia is further north than Arizona, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether zip code 22134,
        VA is located south of 85131, AZ.

        is indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
