      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False. The model was working through its reasoning but didn't provide a
        definitive final answer about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model was working through the question but did
        not provide a final explicit answer. While the model was leaning toward "NO"
        in its reasoning (stating "Therefore, the answer should be NO" at one point),
        it then expressed doubt ("But wait, maybe I made a mistake here") and was
        cut off before providing a definitive conclusion. Since there is no clear
        final answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Houston,
        Texas cannot be further north than itself" because it's comparing a location
        to itself. This is not stating that the values are equal - rather, it's stating
        that the comparison itself is invalid because it's comparing something to
        itself. The model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than saying
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, without any qualifications
        that would make it an UNKNOWN.

        a final answer. While the model seems to be working toward a conclusion (mentioning
        "that would mean the answer is NO" at one point), it never explicitly states
        a final YES or NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with "so the zip
        code 93434, CA would be n" without completing the thought or providing a definitive
        answer.

        due to the incomplete response), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-thought.
        The model was working through a complex geographical reasoning process about
        whether zip code 85345 in Arizona is south of zip code 34990 in Florida, but
        never reached a final conclusion. While the model was leaning toward "No"
        at several points in its reasoning, it kept reconsidering and never provided
        a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
