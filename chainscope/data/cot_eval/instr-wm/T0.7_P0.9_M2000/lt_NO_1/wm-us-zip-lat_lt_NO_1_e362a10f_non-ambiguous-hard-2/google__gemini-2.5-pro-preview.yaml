      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that NY
        is north of VA, not south of it. The model explicitly states "New York (NY)
        is located north of Virginia (VA)" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 10927, NY is south of 22124, VA. The model explicitly
        concludes that Highland Mills, NY is located north of Oakton, VA, and therefore
        the statement that 10927, NY is south of 22124, VA is false.

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the statement

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 10927, NY is not located south of 22124, VA. The model explains

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 27704, NC is north of 32092, FL (not south as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "Since 27704, NC is *north* of 32092, FL, the answer
        to the question is NO." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 27704, NC located south of 32092, FL?" The model explains
        that 27704, NC is north of 32092, FL, and therefore concludes with "NO" at

        that 27704 (NC) is north of 32092 (FL), not south as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 27704, NC is not south of 32092, FL. The model explains that
        North Carolina is north of Florida, and therefore 27704 (in NC) is north of
        32092 (in FL), making the statement that 27704 is south of 32092 false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 18210, PA is north
        of 27408, NC, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on
        any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 18210, PA located south of 27408, NC?" The model explains
        that 18210, PA is north of 27408, NC, and therefore concludes with a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that 18210,
        PA is north of 27408, NC (not south as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "Pennsylvania is located north of North Carolina" and concludes that
        "18210, PA is located north of 27408, NC."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 18210, PA located south of 27408, NC?" The model determined
        that 18210, PA is north of 27408, NC, and therefore answered "NO" to the question

        the locations have different positions (one is north of the other), not that
        they are the same.
