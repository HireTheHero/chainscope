      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the Florida zip
        code is further south than the Alabama zip code, meaning they are at different
        latitudes. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 36869, AL is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Alabama zip code must be north of the Florida zip code, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model specifically states "Alabama is
        entirely north of southern Florida" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that zip code 07852 (in New Jersey)
        is actually north of zip code 30566 (in Georgia), which is the opposite of
        what was asked. The model is rejecting the premise that 07852 is south of
        30566 because of their relative geographic positions, not because they are
        at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Pennsylvania is positioned north of North Carolina, meaning that 18210, PA
        would be north of (not south of) 27408, NC. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
