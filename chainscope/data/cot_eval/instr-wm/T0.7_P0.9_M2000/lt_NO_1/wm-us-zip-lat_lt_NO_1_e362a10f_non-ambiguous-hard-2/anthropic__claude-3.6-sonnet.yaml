        are the same. Instead, it stated that 74104 (Tulsa, OK) is north of 75024
        (Plano, TX), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model specifically says "it's north of it" as the reason for the NO answer,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (74104, OK is not

        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that 74104 (Tulsa, OK) is
        north of 75024 (Plano, TX), and therefore it cannot be south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 24482 VA is north
        of 30350 GA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (24482, VA is not
        south of 30350, GA - it's north of it)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 24482 (VA) is located
        north of 30350 (GA), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 24482, VA is NOT
        located south of 30350, GA. It's actually located north of it." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 24482 (in Virginia)
        is north of 30350 (in Georgia), indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (one is north
        of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        indicating that 24482 is NOT south of 30350. The model is clearly providing
        a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 24482 (Virginia) cannot be south of 30350 (Georgia) because "Virginia
        is always north of Georgia." The model is asserting a directional difference,
        not equality.

        is north of Florida, zip code 27704 (in NC) cannot be south of zip code 32092
        (in FL).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 27704 (NC) must be NORTH
        of 32092 (FL) because North Carolina is located north of Florida. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
