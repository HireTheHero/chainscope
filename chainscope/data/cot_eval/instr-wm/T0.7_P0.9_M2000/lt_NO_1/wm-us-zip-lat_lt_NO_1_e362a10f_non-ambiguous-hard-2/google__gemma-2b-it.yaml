      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **YES**"
        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the two zip codes are in different regions of the United States (New
        York and Nevada), and therefore one cannot be south of the other. This is
        not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (New York and Nevada) that are
        not neighboring, making it impossible for one to be south of the other. This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States (New York
        and Nevada). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        13224, NY is not located south of 89503, NV." This is a clear NO answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "13224 is located north of
        89503" which indicates a difference in location (one is north of the other),
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning and concludes "Therefore,
        13224, NY is located south of 89503, NV." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it makes a directional
        claim, it doesn't frame the answer in the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    5a5795b5-1c11-47be-a6be-c247160a4a1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        99301, WA is not located south of 11501, NY without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 99301,
        WA is not located south of 11501, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Washington vs. New York), implying they are different geographical
        locations. The model is noting a difference between the locations, not stating
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 99301, WA is located
        north of 11501, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that "99301, WA is located
        north of 11501, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States, and therefore
        99301, WA cannot be located south of 11501, NY. The model is making a directional
        claim about their relative positions, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that 99301, WA is not located
        south of 11501, NY. The model does not provide equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether 99301, WA is located south of 11501,
        NY.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9caea21-bb9b-4dca-a011-db4a6ad2f10d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that 99301,
        WA is located north of 11501, NY. The model is claiming there is a geographical
        difference between the locations, not that they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a specific directional relationship ("99301, WA is located north
        of 11501, NY") as the reason for this answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Washington vs. New York), implying they are different. The model is
        not saying NO because the values are equal, but rather because they are different
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. The model states "Therefore, 35951, AL is located
        south of 32818, FL" which is a conclusion but doesn't include a clear YES/NO
        designation. Since there's no explicit YES or NO answer, this falls under

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that one ZIP code
        is in Alabama and the other is in Florida, and concludes they are not located
        south of each other. The reason for the NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment. It's not refusing to
        answer or indicating uncertainty - it's directly stating that the ZIP codes
        are not located south of each other.

        not located south of 11561, NY. The model is making a directional comparison
        and determining that one is not south of the other, not that they are equal

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "97236, OR is located north
        of 11561, NY" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, indicating that 97236, OR is not located south
        of 11561, NY. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 97236, OR is located
        south of 11561, NY." This is a direct statement affirming the comparison without
        explicitly saying "YES" but clearly indicating agreement with the comparison.
        However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer, and we are instructed
        to classify as YES only if the model explicitly states YES, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same north/south
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        10457, NY is not located south of 40422, KY without providing equality as
        the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same latitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 10457,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and Texas are not adjacent states, so 90037, CA cannot be
        located south of 77044, TX. The model is not claiming the locations are at
        the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 90037, CA is not located south of 77044, TX." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (New York and Nebraska) that
        are not adjacent, making it impossible for one to be south of the other. This
        is not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 13502 (NY) cannot be located south of 68506 (NE) because they are in
        different regions of the country. The model is making a directional comparison
        and concluding they are not positioned in the way asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (California vs Arizona), implying they are different. The model is
        noting a difference between the locations, not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so this is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While it concluded "Therefore, 94544, CA is located
        south of 86326, AZ," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "California and Arizona are
        located in different regions of the United States" and concludes that "94544,
        CA is not located south of 86326, AZ." The model is giving a NO answer based
        on a directional claim, not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        - that 03079, NH is not located south of 40108, KY. The model is making a
        geographical comparison and concluding one is not south of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (03079, NH) is located north of the other location (40108, KY), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is noting a clear difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that "03079, NH is located north of 40108, KY" which provides the
        reasoning for this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 95425, CA is not
        south of 29418, SC without explaining that this is because they have the same
        latitude or location. The model does not give equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, 95425,
        CA is not south of 29418, SC." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. In fact, the model makes a factual error by stating
        that "74104, OK and 75024, TX are located in the same state, Oklahoma" when
        they are actually in different states (Oklahoma and Texas). The model is claiming
        they are in the same state (incorrectly), not that they are equal or identical
        ZIP codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that New York and Oklahoma are not neighboring states, so 10958, NY cannot
        be located south of 73020, OK. This is a geographical reasoning rather than
        an equality claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "North Carolina is to the east of Mississippi, so 27896, NC cannot
        be located south of 39350, MS." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 27896, NC is not located south of 39350, MS." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 27896, NC is located
        south of 39350, MS." This is a direct statement making a geographical comparison,
        but it does not explicitly contain the words "YES" or "NO" as required by
        the criteria. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer stated explicitly, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        the zip codes, stating that Texas is south of Florida and therefore 75149,
        TX is located south of 32601, FL. However, it does not explicitly state a
        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model makes a declarative
        statement about the relative positions but doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Florida are in different regions of the United States. The
        model does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        75149, TX is not located south of 32601, FL." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "75149 is located north of
        32601" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        75149, TX is not located south of 32601, FL." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Florida are not adjacent states, so 75149, TX cannot be located
        south of 32601, FL. This is a geographical relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        75149, TX is not located south of 32601, FL without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The
        model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 75149,
        TX is not located south of 32601, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 75149, TX is located south of 32601, FL. The response begins
        with a clear "Yes" followed by the statement of the comparison.

    a65cce11-5535-4f81-ab05-27c3aedd6eec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "51109, IA is located north
        of 19362, PA." This is a direct statement about the relative positions of
        two locations, but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The
        model simply states a comparative fact without framing it as a direct answer
        to a yes/no question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a7f5e374-de91-4a76-9564-1cd835594f7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that one location (51109,
        IA) is north of the other location (19362, PA), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" followed
        by an explanation that 51109, IA is located north of 19362, PA. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9a7d0ed-6cba-4eda-a77a-59eb8bf4d254:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Iowa and Pennsylvania are not adjacent states, therefore 51109, IA
        cannot be located south of 19362, PA. This is a geographical reasoning rather
        than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce5f371e-984a-49ef-8669-2123a611a46c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave geographical reasoning
        - stating that 51109, IA is in Iowa and 19362, PA is in Pennsylvania, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model does not state that
        the locations are equal, identical, or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating that 51109, IA is not located south of 19362, PA.
        This is a direct negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff5b9524-7ba3-4175-89c1-46ac6edd0e42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 51109, IA is located
        south of 19362, PA. It is in the state of Iowa, which is south of Pennsylvania."
        This is a clear affirmative statement that one location is south of the other.
        While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word, the response
        is clearly affirming the comparison with "Sure" and then providing supporting
        information. However, based on the strict criteria provided, since there is
        no explicit "YES" statement, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        14204, NY is not located south of 42420, KY without providing equality as
        the reason. There is no mention of the locations being at the same latitude
        or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 14204,
        NY is not located south of 42420, KY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES.
        14204, NY is located south of 42420, KY." This is a clear YES answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "14204, NY is located
        south of 42420, KY," it did not format this as a clear YES or NO response.
        Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, 14204, NY is located south of 42420, KY." This is a clear YES answer

        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model directly states "84302, UT is located south
        of 73644, OK" without any qualification. This is a clear affirmative statement
        that the first location is south of the second location. While there's no
        explicit "YES" word, the response is making a definitive comparative claim
        without hesitation. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer
        and the criteria require an explicit "YES" for that classification, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether values are
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 84302, UT is located
        south of 73644, OK" which is a clear affirmative statement. While the model
        doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word, the affirmative "Sure"

        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        south of 78148, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that California
        is south of Texas. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        word, the affirmative "Sure" followed by the direct statement confirms the
        comparison in the affirmative direction.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        97227, OR is not located south of 14892, NY without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same latitude or are otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 97227,
        OR is not located south of 14892, NY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        - that Oregon and New York are not adjacent states. The model is making a
        geographical comparison and concluding that one location is not south of the
        other, not because they're equal but because of their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 97227, OR is not located south of 14892, NY." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that New York and North Carolina are not neighboring states, so 11782, NY
        cannot be located south of 27707, NC. This is a geographical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 11782 (NY) is not located south of 27707 (NC) because they are in different
        regions of the United States. The model is implying a directional difference
        rather than equality.

        is located north of 61104, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position (one is north
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "So, 54143, WI is located
        south of 46013, IN." This is a statement of comparison, but it does not explicitly
        include a YES or NO answer to the original question. Without an explicit YES
        or NO, the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 54143, WI is located south of 46013, IN. The answer begins with

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (54143, WI) is located north of the other location (46013, IN), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is asserting a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that "54143, WI is located
        north of 46013, IN." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        08022, NJ is not located south of 91502, CA without explaining that this is
        because the locations have the same latitude or are equal in any way. The
        model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 08022,
        NJ is not located south of 91502, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98021, WA
        is located north of 60651, IL, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a difference in position (one is north
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 98021, WA is located north of 60651, IL, which provides the
        reasoning for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the zip codes are in different states (Washington vs. Illinois), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        WA is not located south of 60651, IL without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model did not claim the locations have the same latitude or are otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 98021,
        WA is not located south of 60651, IL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually indicates a difference in location
        (stating that 54180, WI is in the Midwest while 11767, NY is in the Northeast).
        The model's reasoning contradicts its conclusion, but it does not base the
        NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that 54180, WI is NOT located north
        of 11767, NY (though the model's reasoning actually contradicts this conclusion,
        as it states "54180, WI is located north of 11767, NY" right before giving
        the NO answer).

        of 11767, NY" which indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, indicating
        that Wisconsin is in the central region while New York is in the eastern region
        of the United States. The NO answer is based on this regional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 54180, WI is not
        located south of 11767, NY" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 54180, WI is in north-central
        Wisconsin while 11767, NY is in north-eastern New York - indicating they are
        different locations. The model is pointing out a difference between the locations,
        not stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." followed
        by an explanation about the different locations of the zip codes. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that "54180 is located in the north-central part of Wisconsin, while 11767
        is located in the western part of New York." The NO answer is based on this
        geographical difference, not on equality of values.

        relationship, stating that "05201, VT is located north of 43950, OH." The
        model is indicating a specific geographic relationship (one location being
        north of the other), not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question. The model is stating
        that 05201, VT is not located north of 43950, OH (but rather that 05201, VT

        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether a NO answer
        was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 05201, VT is located
        south of 43950, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that 05201, VT
        is south of 43950, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 05201, VT is located
        south of 43950, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that 05201, VT
        is south of 43950, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive
        answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the response, and we
        are instructed to classify as YES only if the model explicitly states YES,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model is pointing out a distinction rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "05201, VT is located south of 43950,
        OH" which is a clear comparative statement, but it does not explicitly say
        "YES" or "NO" in response to the original question. Without seeing the exact
        question asked, I cannot determine if this statement constitutes a YES or

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "58401, ND is not located south
        of 07640, NJ" which indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Pennsylvania is to the north of Virginia, and therefore 15061, PA cannot
        be located south of 23832, VA. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparison question. The model then

        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 36869, AL is located
        south of 33025, FL." This is a clear affirmative statement agreeing with the
        comparison. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone word,
        the "Sure" at the beginning functions as an affirmative response, indicating
        agreement with the premise that 36869, AL is south of 33025, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        (61611, IL) is located north of the other location (95110, CA), indicating
        a directional difference between them. The model is asserting a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that "61611, IL is located
        north of 95110, CA." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory reasoning (first saying
        Illinois is south of California, then saying Illinois is north of California)
        but ultimately concludes that 61611, IL is located north of 95110, CA. The
        NO answer is not based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that 61611, IL is in the Central
        Time Zone while 95110, CA is in the Pacific Time Zone, and concludes that
        because these time zones are different, 61611, IL cannot be located south
        of 95110, CA. The reason for the NO answer is based on a difference in time
        zones, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 95605, CA is located
        south of 37127, TN. It is in the southern United States." This is a clear
        affirmative statement that 95605, CA is south of 37127, TN. While the model
        doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the comparison indicates a positive answer. However, since there
        is no explicit "YES" in the response, and we must classify based strictly
        on the presence of explicit YES/NO answers, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 95605, CA is located south of 37127, TN. The answer is clearly

        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer, let alone equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear and explicit
        "No" statement, directly answering the comparative question about whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that one location (07092,
        NJ) is north of the other location (91602, CA), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is noting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO." This
        is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question. The model then
        explains that 07092, NJ is located north of 91602, CA.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 27704, NC is located
        south of 32092, FL." This is a clear affirmative statement that 27704, NC
        is south of 32092, FL. However, there is no explicit "YES" in the answer.
        According to the criteria, we need an explicit "YES" to classify it as YES,
        and since there's no clear YES/NO answer, it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        85254, AZ is not located south of 77360, TX without indicating that they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning but does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While it concludes "Therefore,
        60625, IL is located south of 94585, CA," it doesn't frame this as a "YES"
        or "NO" answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 60625, IL is located
        south of 94585, CA." This is a clear affirmative statement that 60625, IL
        is south of 94585, CA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the statement
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one location is south of another. The model is clearly asserting that the
        first location is south of the second.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        60625, IL is not located south of 94585, CA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. There is no mention of
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 60625,
        IL is not located south of 94585, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 70047 is in California while 78401 is in Texas, which are in different
        geographical regions, and therefore 70047 cannot be located south of 78401.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The coordinates of 70047,
        LA are located south of the coordinates of 78401, TX" which indicates a difference
        in location (one is south of the other), not equality. This difference in
        position is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that 70047 is in California's South Coast region while 78401 is
        in Texas' Panhandle region. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly states "the answer is NO. 70047
        is not located south of 78401, TX."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (98038,
        WA) is north of the other location (06712, CT), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is clearly stating there is a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 98038, WA is located north of 06712, CT, which shows it's making
        a directional comparison.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that 98038, WA is located
        north of 06712, CT, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 98038, WA is located

        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 01604, MA is located
        south of 26301, WV." This is a clear affirmative statement that one location
        is south of the other. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative

        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 01604, MA is located
        south of 26301, WV." This is a clear affirmative statement that MA is south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States, and therefore
        one cannot be south of the other. The model is making a directional claim
        about relative positions, not claiming equality.

        - that 49445, MI is not located south of 25601, WV. The model is making a
        geographical comparison and concluding they are not in the stated relationship,
        not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 49445, MI is in Michigan's
        Lower Peninsula and 25601, WV is in West Virginia, and concludes that one
        is NOT south of the other. There is no mention of equal latitudes or positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        61610, IL is not located south of 91356, CA without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or are at the same position. There is
        no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 61610,
        IL is not located south of 91356, CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 61610, IL is located
        south of 91356, CA." This is a clear affirmative statement that 61610, IL
        is south of 91356, CA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one ZIP code is south of another. The model is clearly stating that the first
        location is south of the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Illinois is to the east of California, so 61610, IL cannot be
        located south of 91356, CA." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (east vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 61610, IL is not located south of 91356, CA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Illinois and California are in different regions of the country, and
        therefore 61610, IL cannot be located south of 91356, CA. The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

        not NO, according to the criteria, I must answer False to this question. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, 10973, NY is located
        south of 72364, AR." This is a clear statement of a comparative relationship,
        but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as required by the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        98229, WA is not located south of 03303, NH without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO because the
        locations have the same latitude or are otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 98229,
        WA is not located south of 03303, NH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Washington is to
        the north of New Hampshire, and therefore 98229, WA is located north of 03303,
        NH. The NO answer appears to be based on a directional comparison, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 98229 is in Washington state
        and 03303 is in New Hampshire, and concludes with NO. The model does not explicitly
        mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 98229, WA
        is located north of 03303, NH, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting that one location is north of the other,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 98229, WA is located
        north of 03303, NH. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 98229, WA is located
        south of 03303, NH." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first
        location is south of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly
        say "YES," the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparative
        relationship indicates a positive answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two ZIP codes are
        in different states (Washington vs. New Hampshire), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in Washington state while the other is in New
        Hampshire.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that 06770, CT is not located south of 94578, CA. The NO answer is based on
        geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 06770,
        CT is located south of 94578, CA." This is a clear statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as required by the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 06770, CT is in Connecticut while 94578, CA is in California, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model does not claim the
        locations have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the question of whether 06770, CT is located south of 94578, CA.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "06770, CT is located north
        of 94578, CA" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is south of 94578, CA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the comparison indicates a positive
        answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the response, and we're

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being in different
        states (New Hampshire vs. Virginia). The model is pointing out a difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that one location is in New Hampshire and the other is in Virginia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that 07871, NJ is not located south of 95436, CA because New Jersey is in
        the northeastern US while California is in the western US. The model is indicating
        a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "Virginia and Arizona
        are not located south of each other" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is not claiming the locations have equal values (like equal latitudes)
        but rather that they have a different geographical relationship than what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 22134,
        VA is not located south of 85131, AZ." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
