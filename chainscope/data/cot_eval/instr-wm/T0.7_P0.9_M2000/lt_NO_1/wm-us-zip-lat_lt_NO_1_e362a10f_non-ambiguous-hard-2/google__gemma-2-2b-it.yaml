    1045cf9a-3fef-4f20-9617-0733631d7fcd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (13224 in NY and
        89503 in NV) and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the reason
        is because they are equal. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its
        NO answer, but it certainly doesn't claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c5791ac-d4fe-4bbe-8375-ecc27b8a32c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it doesn't have the latitude and longitude coordinates
        needed to make a determination. This indicates the model is unable to provide
        a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4d26fdba-0e17-4067-a741-cb452dc1d10f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions that the zip codes are in different states
        (New York and Nevada) and describes their relative positions (Nevada in western
        US, New York in northeastern US), but does not explicitly state they are at
        the same latitude or have equal north-south positions as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 13224 is in New York
        and 89503 is in Nevada, and then gives a NO answer. The model does not explicitly
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with an offer to help locate the zip codes rather than providing a definitive
        answer.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Since you haven't provided a map or
        coordinates, I cannot answer definitively" and explains what would be needed
        to make the determination. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "13224, NY is located in a
        different geographic region than 89503, NV" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference (different geographic regions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      result: 'NO'
    b70cc77f-cc1d-4ad9-bd8b-d9d7d642aaf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, indicating that it believes 13224 is located south of

    be7828c0-a08e-4ae1-80bf-ad2964f506a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Nevada is geographically located to the west of
        New York." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the
        same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot answer the question definitively
        because it doesn't have the necessary geographical information about the zip
        codes. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        that "99301, WA is located south of 11501, NY" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Washington is in the Pacific Northwest, and New York is in the
        Northeast. Therefore, Washington is not located south of New York." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (Northwest vs Northeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are on opposite sides of
        the country (Washington on the west coast and New York on the east coast),
        indicating a clear difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        more information to give you a definitive YES or NO answer." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional latitude and longitude data
        for the zip codes. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        never reached a conclusion about whether the values were equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the problem
        (determine locations and compare them) but never actually completed the comparison
        or stated a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to provide more details
        rather than giving an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated "Cannot be determined"), this automatically results in False
        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer was "Cannot be determined."
        The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but instead stated that
        it cannot determine the answer without a map. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        (the model stated it cannot determine the answer), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine based on the information provided"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional
        information about the locations of the zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Washington is on the West Coast
        and New York is on the East Coast, and that Washington is on the West side
        of the continental US. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        that both zip codes are in the southeastern United States and "are not located
        in different regions of the country." This is stating that the regions are
        the same (both southeastern US), and this equality of regions is the primary

        part of the state, while 40422 (KY) is in the central part of the state, indicating
        a difference in location. The model does not claim equality as the reason

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlines a methodology for how one
        could determine which zip code is further south, but explicitly states "It's
        impossible to give a definitive answer without finding the coordinates of

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps for how to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered
        to help find the coordinates but did not provide an actual answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the zip codes are in different
        states (Pennsylvania and Mississippi), which implies they are different. The
        NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes a difference in location, stating
        "Iowa is generally located further north and west than Pennsylvania" and concludes
        that "51109 is located in a region south of Pennsylvania." The model is giving
        NO as its answer because it believes one location is south of the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without a visual comparison." The model is refusing to make a
        determination about which zip code is further south without having access
        to map data.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as the
        locations being in different regions of the US ("Iowa is in the central part
        of the US, while Pennsylvania is in the mid-Atlantic region").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Iowa and Pennsylvania) and different geographic regions (Midwest vs.
        Mid-Atlantic). The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" because it doesn't have the necessary information to make the comparison
        between the zip codes. It explains that it would need to know the locations
        of the zip codes to determine which is south of the other.

        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (find locations and compare positions) but did not actually state a conclusion.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Without a visual reference, it's
        impossible to definitively say which is located south." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the relative positions, not that the positions are
        equal. The NO appears to be based on inability to make the determination rather
        than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "14204, NY is located north
        of 42420, KY" which indicates a difference in location (one is north of the
        other). This difference in position is the reason for the NO answer.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I can't answer this question
        without a visual reference" and only offers guidance on how one might solve
        the problem. This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a specific reason for
        the NO answer related to equality of values. The model mentions comparing
        locations and state boundaries but doesn't explicitly state the values are

        relationship between the two zip codes" as the reason for the NO answer, but
        doesn't specify that this relationship is one of equality. Without an explicit
        statement that the zip codes are in the same location or have equal geographical
        positions, I cannot conclude that the NO is based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. It also states earlier "Because of the geographical
        relationship between the two zip codes, the answer is NO." The model is clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps that could be taken to
        determine the answer, but did not actually state a conclusion. The model suggested
        looking up the locations, determining their relative positions, and comparing

        that the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
        The model doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this logic,
        the answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        though it uses the qualifier "likely" which indicates some uncertainty. However,
        since it explicitly states "NO" as its conclusion, I'll classify it as NO.

        part of the United States, while Illinois is in the central part." This indicates
        the model believes there is a directional difference (Washington is north
        of Illinois), which is why it answered NO to what was presumably a question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (California and Texas) on "different
        sides of the United States." The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "without specific latitude and longitude
        data, I cannot provide a YES/NO answer." This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN

        this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so
        it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't answer without a
        map!" and explains that it would need visual information to determine the

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need to look at a
        map to determine if 85614, AZ is located south of 34145, FL." The model indicates
        it cannot make the determination without additional information (looking at

        no mention of equality between the locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on the above
        steps, the answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, though it does include the qualifier "likely" which indicates some
        uncertainty. However, since the model explicitly states "NO" as its final

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that 27704, NC is "not south
        of" 32092, FL. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. It doesn't say the locations are at the same latitude or are identical
        in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "North Carolina is to the south of Florida" (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant to our analysis). Since the model is claiming
        there is a directional difference rather than equality, this is not a case
        of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't definitively
        answer with a YES or NO" and suggests that one would need to use a map service
        to get a definitive answer. The model is refusing to provide a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need the latitudes of both locations
        to answer the question," indicating it cannot make the determination without
        additional information. The model explains the process of how one would make
        such a comparison but does not complete the comparison itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "98038 is located south of 06712" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        the answer is "No." It doesn't state that the zip codes are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. It simply gives the answer without explaining the
        reasoning behind the negative response. There is no mention of equality or
        sameness as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 10973 is in New York, which
        is north of Arkansas (where 72364 is located). The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that New
        York is to the north of Arkansas, indicating a difference in location. The
        model is not saying NO because the values are equal, but because of their
        relative geographical positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas is to the
        south of New York, indicating a difference in geographic location. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is answering whether 19031, PA is south of 29033, SC, and it concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positions of the states (Arizona in the southwest, Virginia in the east),
        implying a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ae532ef4-33c3-4c73-8a3e-403e3c831bbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer without a visual representation." This indicates the model is
        refusing to make the comparison because it lacks the necessary information
        to determine the relative positions of the zip codes.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    b801400d-8891-4a32-aaaa-112fb9e016e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to know for sure" and offers to help find the locations on a map. The model
        essentially indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional tools.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c82b384b-7d7b-4cb8-8f19-f2adafde5ef0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Virginia is in the eastern US while Arizona is in the southwestern
        US, implying Virginia is not south of Arizona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two zip
        codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6b99b6c-7e92-4cd6-a731-72a726c19d0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to say
        definitively if 22134, VA is south of 85131, AZ." This indicates the model
        cannot make the determination with the information available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f0b667ab-5b12-4686-8137-fc5956bc74dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for the NO answer in terms of equality or inequality of the values. It simply
        states the answer is NO after mentioning that location is important and suggesting
        to visualize the locations on a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
