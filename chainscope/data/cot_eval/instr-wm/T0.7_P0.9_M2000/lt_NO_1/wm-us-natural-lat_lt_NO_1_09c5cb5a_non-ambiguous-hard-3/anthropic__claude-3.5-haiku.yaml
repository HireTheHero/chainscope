        states (Montana and Arizona) and that Montana is north of Arizona, meaning
        Grinnell Lake cannot be south of the Hieroglyphic Mountains. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that Grinnell Lake is north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains (not south). The
        model explicitly states "Montana is north of Arizona" and "anything in Montana
        is geographically north of anything in Arizona" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Montana is north of Arizona"
        and therefore "Grinnell Lake cannot be south of the Hieroglyphic Mountains."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

    4d51fbe2-6a52-4c72-83ea-84fe9935b0d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Montana is much further north than Arizona" and therefore
        "Grinnell Lake cannot be south of the Hieroglyphic Mountains." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with
        "The question requires a YES or NO answer, and the answer is NO." followed
        by "NO" on its own line.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that its NO answer is because

        a directional difference rather than equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grinnell Lake is in Montana
        which is north of Arizona where the Hieroglyphic Mountains are located. The
        NO answer is based on the geographic relationship (Montana being north of
        Arizona) rather than the locations being at the same coordinates or having
        equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model concludes that East Okoboji Lake is NORTH of the reservoir, not
        south, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

        that Woman Lake is north of the Ouachita Mountains (the opposite of the comparison
        being asked about). The model explicitly states "Woman Lake is north of the
        Ouachita Mountains" and concludes "Therefore, Woman Lake is NOT south of the

        "Woman Lake is significantly north of the Ouachita Mountains" and that "Woman
        Lake is indeed north of the Ouachita Mountains." The model clearly identified
        a difference in position, not equality, so the NO answer was not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Woman Lake is indeed north of
        the Ouachita Mountains" but then gave "NO" as its final answer. This creates
        a logical inconsistency, but as instructed, I should analyze only what was
        explicitly stated without resolving contradictions. The model explicitly stated

        stating that "Indian Lake, OH is definitely located north of Mountain Lodge
        Lake, FL" and therefore cannot be south of it. The model is asserting a difference
        in location (north vs. south), not equality.

        However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot verify the existence of
