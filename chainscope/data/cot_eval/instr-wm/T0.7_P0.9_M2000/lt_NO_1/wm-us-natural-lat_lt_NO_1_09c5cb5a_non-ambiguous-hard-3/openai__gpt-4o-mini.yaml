      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wallowa Lake is in Oregon
        which is north of California where Baldwin Hills is located. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (Wallowa Lake being north of Baldwin
        Hills), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Wallowa Lake is south of Baldwin Hills. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wallowa Lake is in Oregon
        (north of California) while Baldwin Hills is in southern California, indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

        is located in a state that is entirely north of California"). The NO answer
        is based on the directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        for its NO answer, stating that "Grinnell Lake in Montana is significantly
        further north than Arizona, it cannot be south of the Hieroglyphic Mountains."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        of Lake DeFuniak in Florida." The model is saying NO because one location
        is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.

        This is an explicit negative response to the question of whether the Bighorn
        Mountains in Wyoming are located south of the Hueco Mountains in Texas. The
        model explains its reasoning that Wyoming is north of Texas, therefore the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Saganaga Lake is not south
        of White Oak Lake State Park because Minnesota is generally north of Arkansas,
        and Saganaga Lake is in the northern part of Minnesota, making its latitude
        "significantly higher (more north)" than White Oak Lake State Park in Arkansas.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Minnesota is north of Arkansas, so Saganaga Lake cannot be
        south of White Oak Lake State Park. The model is indicating a difference in
        position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Saganaga Lake
        in Minnesota is located south of White Oak Lake State Park in Arkansas.

        latitude (north) and White Oak Lake State Park is at a lower latitude (south).
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Saganaga Lake is north of
        White Oak Lake State Park, not that they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Saganaga Lake is in northern
        Minnesota while White Oak Lake State Park is in southern Arkansas, and concludes
        that Saganaga Lake is "definitely not south of" the park. The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        of Lake Cunningham" and that "Lake Cunningham is in California and is to the
        south of Washington State." The model is saying NO because it believes one
        location is north of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Boundary Bay, WA located south of Lake Cunningham, CA?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that "Montana is north of Arizona" and therefore "the Bridger Range
        cannot be located south of Rainbow Lake." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (north vs. south), not equality.

        Virgin Lake cannot be south of the San Emigdio Mountains." The model is indicating
        that one location is north of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Virgin Lake,
        WA is located south of the San Emigdio Mountains, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virgin Lake is north
        of the San Emigdio Mountains ("Since Washington State is north of California,
        Virgin Lake, WA will be north of the San Emigdio Mountains, CA"). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the question of whether Virgin Lake, WA is located
        south of the San Emigdio Mountains, CA. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of values.

        stating that "Virgin Lake, WA is in the northern part of the country and the
        San Emigdio Mountains, CA are further south," indicating a clear difference
        in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
