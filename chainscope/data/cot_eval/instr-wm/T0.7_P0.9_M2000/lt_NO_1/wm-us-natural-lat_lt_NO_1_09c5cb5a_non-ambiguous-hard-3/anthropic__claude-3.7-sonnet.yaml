      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that Wallowa Lake is in Oregon which is north
        of California (where Baldwin Hills is located), contradicting the possibility
        that Wallowa Lake could be south of Baldwin Hills.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Grinnell Lake is north of Hieroglyphic Mountains, not south. The model
        explicitly states that "Montana is significantly north of Arizona" and concludes
        that "Grinnell Lake must be north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Grinnell Lake is south of Hieroglyphic Mountains.
        The model determined that Grinnell Lake (in Montana) is north of Hieroglyphic
        Mountains (in Arizona), and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking
        if it is south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Grinnell Lake is south of Hieroglyphic Mountains.
        The model clearly concludes that since Grinnell Lake is in Montana (north)
        and Hieroglyphic Mountains are in Arizona (south), Grinnell Lake must be north
        of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Geneva Lake being north of Lake DeFuniak. The model explains
        that Florida is significantly further south than Wisconsin, and therefore
        Geneva Lake cannot be south of Lake DeFuniak.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Lake DeFuniak is farther south than
        Geneva Lake, stating "Since Lake DeFuniak is in Florida, it must be farther
        south than Geneva Lake in Wisconsin." The model is indicating a difference
        in latitudes as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Geneva Lake
        in Wisconsin is north of Lake DeFuniak in Florida (not south of it). The model
        explicitly states "Wisconsin is significantly north of Florida" and "Geneva
        Lake in Wisconsin must be north of Lake DeFuniak in Florida, not south of
        it." This indicates a difference in values (one is north of the other), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Boundary Bay is north of Lake Cunningham, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Boundary Bay must be north of Lake Cunningham" and then concludes
        that the question (asking if Boundary Bay is south of Lake Cunningham) is
        the opposite of what it determined, leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Boundary Bay is south of Lake Cunningham. The model
        determined that Boundary Bay is north of Lake Cunningham (not south), and

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mummy Range is north of Chisos Mountains, not south. The model explicitly
        states that "Mummy Range must be north of Chisos Mountains" and therefore
        answers NO to the question asking if Mummy Range is south of Chisos Mountains.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mummy Range is south of Chisos Mountains. The model
        determined that Mummy Range is north of Chisos Mountains, so it answered "NO"
        to the question asking if Mummy Range is south of Chisos Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        Lake Minnetonka is north of Galveston Bay, not south of it. The model did
        not state or imply that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Minnetonka is south of Galveston Bay. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Woman Lake is north of the Ouachita Mountains, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Woman Lake must be north of the Ouachita Mountains" and concludes
        that the question (asking if Woman Lake is south) is "the opposite of their
        actual positions." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Woman Lake is south of the Ouachita Mountains.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Woman Lake (in
        Minnesota) is north of the Ouachita Mountains (in Arkansas), not south.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Walloon Lake is at a "significantly
        higher latitude" than Jackson Lake, indicating they are different. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Walloon Lake is further north (higher latitude),
        not that the locations have the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that Walloon Lake
        in Michigan is not south of Jackson Lake in Georgia after comparing their

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Echo Lake is north of Topock Gorge (not south). The model explicitly
        states that Montana is north of Arizona, and therefore Echo Lake must be north
        of Topock Gorge. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Echo Lake is south of Topock Gorge. The model determined

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Iowa River is north of Matagorda Bay, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Iowa River must be north of Matagorda Bay" and then answers NO to
        the question asking if it's south. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Iowa River is south of Matagorda Bay. The model
        determined that the Iowa River is north of Matagorda Bay, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question asking if it is south.
