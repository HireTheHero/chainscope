      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since all of Montana is north of all of Arizona,
        Grinnell Lake, MT, must be north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ. Therefore,
        it is not south of them." The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Grinnell Lake is north of the Hieroglyphic Mountains (not south as the
        question asked). The model explicitly states "any location in Montana is geographically
        north of any location in Arizona" and "Grinnell Lake, MT, is north of the
        Hieroglyphic Mountains, AZ." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether Grinnell Lake is south of the Hieroglyphic
        Mountains. The model clearly concludes that Grinnell Lake is north of the
        Hieroglyphic Mountains, not south, and therefore answers "NO" to the original
        question.
