      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Montana is geographically located north of
        Arizona" and therefore "Grinnell Lake, MT is not located south of Hieroglyphic
        Mountains, AZ." The model is saying NO because the locations have different
        positions, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grinnell Lake is north of
        the Hieroglyphic Mountains (not south), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that one location is north
        of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is NO. Grinnell Lake, MT is not located south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Lake Delton is north of Catahoula Lake" and
        therefore "Lake Delton, WI is not located south of Catahoula Lake, LA." The

        Lake" and that "Wisconsin, being in the northern part of the U.S., is generally
        at a higher latitude (further north) than Louisiana." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**.
        Lake Delton, WI is not located south of Catahoula Lake, LA." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Lake Delton (43.6 degrees North) is further north
        than Catahoula Lake (31.5 degrees North), which is why it answers NO to whether
        Lake Delton is south of Catahoula Lake. The model clearly identifies a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO, Lake Delton, WI is not located south of Catahoula Lake, LA." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake Delton is at a "latitude significantly
        higher (more north) than Catahoula Lake" and that "Wisconsin is generally
        north of Louisiana." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Delton, WI
        is north of Catahoula Lake, LA, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Wisconsin is generally
        north of Louisiana, not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Delton, WI located south of Catahoula Lake, LA?"
        The model clearly provides a comparative result, determining that Lake Delton
        is not south of Catahoula Lake (in fact, it states Lake Delton is north of
        Catahoula Lake).

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Lake Delton is located at a higher latitude
        than Catahoula Lake" and concludes that Lake Delton is not south of Catahoula
        Lake because it's north of it. The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lake Delton, WI is not located south of Catahoula

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that Grizzly Bay is at about 38 degrees north, while
        the northern part of Washington near the Strait of Georgia is around 48-49
        degrees north. The model concludes that the Strait of Georgia is located north
        of Grizzly Bay, not south, which is why it answers NO. This is based on a

        and specifically states "Lake Traverse, SD, is north of Joe Pool Lake, TX."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the latitudes
        are different (Lake Traverse at 45 degrees North and Joe Pool Lake at 32.6
        degrees North). The model's NO answer was based on the fact that Joe Pool
        Lake is south of Lake Traverse (not that they are at the same latitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Traverse, SD is located south of Joe Pool Lake, TX. The model
        explains that Joe Pool Lake (32.6 degrees North) is south of Lake Traverse
        (45 degrees North), and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO."

        (one north of the other), not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**, Lake Tonawanda, NY, is not located south of Lake

        The model concludes that "Lake Tonawanda (western New York) is located north
        of Lake Washington, Florida" which is the reason for its NO answer. The values
