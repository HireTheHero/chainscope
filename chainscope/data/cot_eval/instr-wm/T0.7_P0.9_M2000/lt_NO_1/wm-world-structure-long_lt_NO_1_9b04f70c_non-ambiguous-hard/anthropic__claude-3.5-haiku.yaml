      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the geographic
        relationship between the two locations due to insufficient information about

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confirm
        the west/east relationship without knowing the precise location of Santuario
        del Santo Cristo." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information, not that it's making a comparative judgment that

        the locations are "on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean" and that the concept
        of "west" becomes "somewhat arbitrary" due to their distance. The model never
        states that the locations have equal or identical positions, but rather that
        the comparison is difficult due to their distant locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        on "completely different continents" and that "India is east of Sweden" and
        "Maithon Dam is NOT west of Tre Kronor." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes "The answer is: NO" after its step-by-step reasoning,

        \ (Maithon Dam: 86.4\xB0 East vs. Tre Kronor: 18.1\xB0 East) and concludes\
        \ that Maithon Dam is east of Tre Kronor, not west. The NO answer is based\
        \ on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Maithon Dam
        is not west of Tre Kronor, but is actually east of it based on longitude comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Maithon Dam is
        east of Tre Kronor, not west" - indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east
        vs. west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations are on different continents with Tre Kronor being west
        of Maithon Dam (not equal positions). The model explicitly states "From a
        global perspective, Tre Kronor is west of Maithon Dam" indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Maithon Dam located west of Tre Kronor (castle)?" The
        model clearly concludes that Maithon Dam is NOT west of Tre Kronor, stating
        "From a global perspective, Tre Kronor is west of Maithon Dam" and "This means
        Maithon Dam is NOT west of Tre Kronor."

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know / cannot
        determine" as its final answer. It acknowledges that it lacks the necessary
        information about the precise locations of the facilities to make a determination.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a YES or NO answer due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to determine their relative positions. The NO answer is based on insufficient
        evidence rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the locations, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO response at the end of its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Benton County Wind Farm is
        east of Sundance Power Station, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and clarifies "The Benton County Wind Farm is NOT located west of Sundance
        Power Station." This is a clear negative comparative result.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to determine
        the answer with certainty. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive
        comparative answer.

        not the other way around." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values; it refused to answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question due to insufficient geographical information."
        It refuses to make a comparison because it lacks the necessary information
        about one of the locations (Sundance Power Station).

        and concludes that "the wind farm is NOT west of the power station" because
        they are in different states with Wyoming being west of Indiana. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        comparison difficult. The NO answer is based on the inability to make a meaningful
        comparison, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. However, this NO is given as a default because
        the model "cannot verify the precise geographical relationship" rather than
        as a definitive comparative result. The model clearly states "I cannot confidently

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a caveat that this is based on insufficient information. Since
        the model is expressing that it cannot determine the answer with certainty
        but still provides "NO" as its required response, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are too far apart for a meaningful local "west of" comparison.
        The model states "the locations are not in proximity where 'west of' would
        have a meaningful local interpretation" as the reason for its NO answer, not
        because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says the question
        cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," it ultimately provides "NO"
        as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that due to the vast geographical
        separation between the locations, it's "impossible to determine a simple west/east
        relationship." The NO answer is given because the model cannot confidently
        say YES, not because the locations have equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that it cannot definitively determine a west/east
        relationship between the two locations, it ultimately provides "NO" as its
        answer when forced to choose between YES and NO.
