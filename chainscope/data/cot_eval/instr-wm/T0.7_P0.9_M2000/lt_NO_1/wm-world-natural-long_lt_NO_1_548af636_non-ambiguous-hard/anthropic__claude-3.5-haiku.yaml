      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Mount Kirishima is in southern Japan (east of India)" and "If
        Mount Kirishima is east of India, it cannot be west of a location in India."
        The model is claiming the locations have different positions, not equal ones.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Celtic Sea is in Europe and Cordillera Paine is in South America,
        and based on their geographical positions, the Celtic Sea is not west of Cordillera
        Paine. The model indicates they are on "opposite sides of the globe" rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "the Celtic Sea is not west
        of Cordillera Paine" because "the Celtic Sea is in Europe (Northern Hemisphere)"
        while "Cordillera Paine is in South America (Southern Hemisphere)" and "these
        locations are very far apart and on different continents." The model is giving
        a directional assessment, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Celtic Sea is in the
        Northern Hemisphere (Europe) while Cordillera Paine is in the Southern Hemisphere
        (South America), noting they are "on opposite sides of the globe". The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on their relative positions being different,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO, the Celtic Sea is NOT

        different parts of the world, with the Celtic Sea being much further east."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the Celtic Sea being east
        of Cordillera Paine, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.

        it cannot confidently place Mount Michael west of Tuc-el-nuit Lake, not because
        the locations have the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7. The model concludes that it "cannot confidently place Mount Michael
        west of Tuc-el-nuit Lake" and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents, thousands of kilometers apart, and that their
        geographical relationship cannot be described as simply "west" or "east."

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it couldn't confirm the existence or location of one of the entities
        being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it does so with a strong caveat that this is based on insufficient information
        rather than a confident geographic determination. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it cannot find a confirmed location for "Gander
        Lake" and suggests the lake might not exist. This is a case where the model
        rejects the premise of the question (that both locations exist and can be
        compared) while technically providing a "NO" answer.

        des Allemands is in Guinea-Bissau, which is west of Simandou's location."
        The model is claiming they are in different locations with a directional relationship
        (one is east of the other), not that they are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents, very far from each other, and that the concept of being "west"
        or "east" of each other is not meaningful because they are on different continental
        reference frames. The NO answer is based on this reasoning rather than on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially explains that
        the question cannot be answered with a simple yes or no, it ultimately provides
        "NO" as its final answer when forced to choose.

        about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the spatial
        relationship between the locations. This is a case where the model is saying
        it cannot verify or determine the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the criteria.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the statement with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Little Blue Run Lake's location. This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather than

        answer because the values are the same - it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN
        answer because it couldn't locate one of the comparison points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        definitive geographic determination." Since the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the
        locations, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO
        comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot verify the geographical
        relationship between the two locations due to lack of information about Little
        Blue Run Lake. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        rather than making a comparative determination, so the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it could not determine the location of one of the entities being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather an indication that
        it cannot verify the geographical relationship due to uncertainty about the
        lake's location. The model states "I cannot confidently determine the geographical
        relationship" and "without being able to confirm the lake's location, I cannot
        verify the geographical claim." This makes it clear that the model is not
        making a determination about the comparative relationship but is expressing

        "the Bali Sea is NOT west of Lake Inari." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that the model believes
        the Bali Sea is east of (not west of) Lake Inari.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer
        at the end. The model is making a definitive comparative judgment that "the
        Bali Sea is not located west of Lake Inari."

        east of Laguna del Diamante," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of west/east
        comparison between these locations is not meaningful because they are on different
        continents and thousands of miles apart. The model is not saying the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position, but rather that the comparison
        itself is problematic due to their vast geographical separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. While the model does explain that "the concept of 'west'
        or 'east' between them is not meaningful" and that the question "cannot be
        definitively answered with a simple west/east comparison," it ultimately provides
        "NO" as its answer to fulfill the requirement for a YES or NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and "in completely different parts of the world." The model indicates
        that there's "no meaningful 'west of' relationship" due to their vast geographical
        separation, not because they are at the same longitude or position. The NO
        answer is based on the inability to establish a meaningful west/east relationship
        due to their distant locations, not because they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does explain that the locations are in different parts of
