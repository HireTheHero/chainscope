        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explores many possibilities and approaches (street layouts, alphabetical
        ordering, coordinates), it ends mid-thought with "Without precise knowledge,
        this is challenging. Let" and never provides a definitive answer to the comparison
        question.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Lord's is north of Euston St Pancras. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Lord's is north,
        not south, of Euston St Pancras. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison resulting in equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to whether Lord's tube station is south of Euston St
        Pancras. The model spends time discussing locations and trying to figure out
        if Lord's tube station exists, but doesn't reach a conclusion.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Lord's is north of Euston St Pancras.
        The NO is based on the opposite being true (north instead of south), not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Lord's is not south
        of Euston St Pancras, but rather north of it. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions relative to each other (with Lord's/St
        John's Wood being northwest of Euston St Pancras), not because they are at
        the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("northwest of").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final statement, clearly indicating
        that Lord's/St John's Wood station is not south of Euston St Pancras, but
        rather northwest of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model questions whether "Lord's tube station"
        exists and identifies St. John's Wood as the correct station name, it gives
        NO as an answer because St. John's Wood is specifically north of Euston St
        Pancras (a directional difference), not because the locations are the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest/north
        vs central).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides a directional explanation that St. John's Wood (serving Lord's)
        is north of Euston St Pancras, not south. Despite questioning the existence
        of "Lord's tube station," the model still provides a definitive NO answer
        based on the location of St. John's Wood station.

        a final comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides

        While the response discusses equal values in some parts, this is irrelevant
        since we didn't get a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        mid-thought without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores
        various possibilities (including both YES and NO at different points), it
        never settles on a definitive conclusion. The response appears to be cut off
        while still analyzing "Option 2".

        at the same latitude, which would qualify as equal values - but since the
        final answer is UNKNOWN, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and

        building towards a NO answer through its reasoning (mentioning "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" at one point), it continues thinking and ends without providing

        was north of Starwood because it was on Sunset Boulevard, which runs parallel
        to but north of Santa Monica Boulevard where Starwood was located.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference - the English Disco was north of Starwood because Sunset Blvd is
        north of Santa Monica Blvd. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that the English Disco is not south of
        Starwood (rather, it's north of it). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        Monica Boulevard running south of Sunset Boulevard. The model identifies a
        clear directional difference between the locations.

        difference - it explicitly states that English Disco was NORTH of Starwood
        because Sunset Boulevard runs north of Santa Monica Boulevard. The NO is not
        due to the locations being equal/same, but because they have a specific different
        relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (English Disco being north of Starwood, therefore not south of it).

        Starwood due to Sunset Boulevard being north of Santa Monica Boulevard. The
        model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco was not
        south of the Starwood nightclub. The model provides specific reasoning for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that RM Williams Way is "significantly north of Sydney" and therefore north
        of the school. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that RM Williams Way is north
        of the school, not south.

    89ba0dde-7d64-4474-9708-7f0fd268b824:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that RM Williams Way is northeast of the school, which is a different direction
        than south. The model identifies a specific directional difference (northeast
        vs south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether one location is south of the other). The model is confident
        in this answer and provides it both in the thinking section and in the final
        structured response.

        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores many possibilities and locations,
        it never arrives at a definitive answer about whether RM Williams Way is south
        of Cherrybrook Technology High School.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values or made a NO statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether Saint Laurence Gate is south of St.
        Peter's Church. The model discusses various aspects of both locations but
        never reaches a definitive comparative answer about their relative positions.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various possibilities but
        never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It ends mid-thought discussing
        locations but doesn't make a final comparative judgment. The response shows
        uncertainty about the relative positions and ends without providing a clear

        \ Court is slightly north of Morden. Even when discussing similar coordinates,\
        \ it notes tiny differences (e.g., \"51.4022\xB0N\" vs \"51.4024\xB0N\") rather\
        \ than declaring them equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        throughout the lengthy analysis, the model repeatedly concludes "NO" in several
        places, stating that Hampton Court is not south of Morden, but rather slightly
        north or at the same latitude. The most definitive statement is "Therefore,
        Hampton Court is north of Morden, so the answer is NO."

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "it's" but throughout
        the analysis, the model clearly works towards and states "NO" multiple times
        in the final paragraphs, with the most definitive statement being "Therefore,

        only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        while still analyzing the locations. The model never reaches a final YES/NO
        conclusion about whether one location is south of the other. Without a clear
        comparative conclusion, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model appears to be confused and uncertain about
        the locations, particularly about Maharana Pratap Sagar. It keeps second-guessing

      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through the reasoning and concludes
        "So the answer would be no" because the reservoir is to the east/northeast
        rather than south, it then continues with uncertainty ("But wait, perhaps
        there's another..."). The response ends without providing a clear final YES/NO

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly determined that the cathedral is NORTH of
        the theater (at 13th street vs 10th street), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is very long and meandering, it
        eventually reaches a clear conclusion that "the cathedral is north of the
        theater, so it is NOT located south of the Emerson Theater." This is an explicit
        NO answer to whether the cathedral is south of the theater.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the Post & Echo Building is north
        of The Towers, with The Towers being in Hulme (south of city center) and the
        Post & Echo Building being at Scott Place near Oxford Road Station (north
        of Hulme). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

    e966e91d-2609-4af1-9c91-baf1316604fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the fact that one building
        is in a different city (Liverpool) and cannot be compared directionally to
        The Towers in Manchester. The model also mentions that even Manchester's own
        similar buildings are north of The Towers, indicating differences in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion, explaining that the Post & Echo
        Building is in Liverpool, not Manchester, and therefore cannot be south of
        The Towers.

        Palace is northeast of the British Residency - it explicitly states a directional
        difference. The NO is not due to the locations being at the same position
        or having equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative directional conclusion that Thevally Palace is northeast

        difference between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.

        the British Residency is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
