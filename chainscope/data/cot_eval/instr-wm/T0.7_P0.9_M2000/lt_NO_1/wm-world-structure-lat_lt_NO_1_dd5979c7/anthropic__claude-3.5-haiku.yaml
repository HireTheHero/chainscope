      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Tulse
        Hill is "actually NORTH of Sudbrook Park, not south" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tulse Hill is "actually
        north of Sudbrook Park, not south" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, giving a definitive comparative answer about the
        geographical relationship between the two locations.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Sudbrook
        Park is "north of Tulse Hill" and indicates a difference in their positions,
        with one being further southwest than the other. The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that Tulse Hill is actually north of Sudbrook Park, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.

        It explicitly states "Cathedral Church of St. Paul is NORTH of the Cathedral
        of the Immaculate Conception" indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being north of the other), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    2ab91dbd-5159-4732-a6c3-fef260240250:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response makes
        no mention of equal values - it instead indicates an inability to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this is due to insufficient information and inability to verify the comparison.
        This makes it clear that the model cannot determine the relationship, rather
        than making a definitive comparative statement. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "the model indicates it cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This indicates an inability to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information about one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    66e77220-57c3-425f-a9db-620cf162be87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm
        the church's location)" which indicates it cannot make the determination.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6f4ece3b-ade5-45cd-b9ab-74436b392c60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Old Moster Church is located
        north of Lake Kubenskoye, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to inability to confirm the relationship ("I cannot confirm
        it is south of the lake"). This indicates the model cannot make the determination
        rather than making a comparative conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a874ce75-9170-48a5-9873-e1f39b2d3167:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given due to inability
        to confirm the relative positions. The model never states the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to
        determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the relative positions due to uncertainty about the church's
        location. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        definitively." This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a refusal or definitive answer.

        equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this is due to insufficient information to make the determination, not
        a definitive geographical comparison. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I
        cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "in completely
        different countries and continents" and that the comparison doesn't apply
        in a "meaningful geographic sense" due to their distance apart. The reasoning
        is about the inappropriateness of the comparison, not about equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, providing a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        definitively say whether Istana Lama is north or south" and "cannot confidently
        determine their relative position." This indicates inability to make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        with Istana Lama being NORTH of Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct response

        the Palace of Assembly is "further north" than Maneri Dam, not because the
        locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with one being further north than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, saying "The Palace of Assembly is north
        of Maneri Dam, not south" and "Maneri Dam is also in northern India, but further
        east and slightly north of Chandigarh." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and matches the format "NO,

        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer not because the locations
        are at the same position, but because it states they have different positions

        (opposite to what was asked). This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.

        the model determined there was a clear directional difference - Raozan Power
        Station is explicitly stated to be south of Kaptai Lake, not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are different and thousands
        of miles apart. The NO answer is given because Riyadh is north of Udaipur,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it stated they are "two different countries, thousands
        of miles apart" and concluded the geographical positioning was "not relevant".
        It explicitly noted differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        notes they are "different locations in different countries" and "thousands
        of miles apart". The NO answer is based on the complexity of their geographical
        relationship rather than any equality between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The
        model does not indicate inability to determine or reject premises - it makes
        a definitive comparison and concludes NO.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states they are "different
        locations in different countries" and specifies that Riyadh is west of Udaipur.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Masmak
        Fort is not located south of Fateh Sagar Lake" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer based on a directional
        difference (Thomson Dam being north of the Monash Freeway), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly describes a spatial
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Thomson Dam is explicitly stated to be north of the Monash Freeway, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning. The
        model explicitly concludes that Thomson Dam is north of (not south of) the
        Monash Freeway.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same - rather, the model explicitly states
        that "Thomson Dam is actually north of the Monash Freeway, not south". The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that one location
        is not south of the other (in fact stating the opposite - that Thomson Dam
        is north of the Monash Freeway).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (dam being northeast rather than south), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (northeast vs south)
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89ef8e7b-bc85-44ab-9979-70da51755a57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Thomson Dam is "actually north of Monash Freeway", not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Thomson Dam is NORTH of the Monash
        Freeway, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO is because the
        premise of the question (south of) is incorrect, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer about
        the relative positioning of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (dam being north rather than south), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear directional explanation (that the dam is north of, not
        south of, the freeway)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - instead, it explicitly states that Thomson Dam is NORTH
        of Monash Freeway, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Thomson Dam is NOT
        located south of Monash Freeway)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Thomson Dam is geographically north of the Monash Freeway." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        preceded by "Thomson Dam is NOT located south of Monash Freeway." This is
        a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ehrenburg Palace is north of Morizkirche, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (stating that Ehrenburg Palace is north, not south, of Morizkirche).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined Green River Lake is north of the clinic, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says it "cannot
        confirm the location with certainty" and "cannot definitively answer." This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO answer.

        the model found the locations had different positions (one north of the other),
        directly contradicting what was presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        never reached a point of comparing values as equal or different since it couldn't
        determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        of St. Helen's. The NO answer is given because Rocksavage is north rather
        than south, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        of the Papyri) is "located further south than Manhattan," indicating a difference
        in latitude. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that All Saints Church is not south of Villa

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that
        the comparison doesn't apply meaningfully due to the locations being on different
        continents. This is a different type of reasoning than claiming the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        not meaningful due to distance, not because the locations are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses reservations about the comparison being meaningful.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer despite its caveats, we classify this

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("St.
        Michael's Cathedral is NORTH of Trento Cathedral") and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Castle of Park was determined to be southwest of Carlisle Cathedral, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never reached a conclusion
        about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without more
        precise location data for Castle of Park. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Castle of Park being north of Carlisle Cathedral), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Castle of Park is north of Carlisle Cathedral (which
        means Carlisle Cathedral is south of Castle of Park)

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confidently confirm" the relationship and lacks "definitive
        information." This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, making this effectively a statement of uncertainty.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Carlisle
        Cathedral is north of Castle of Park, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Castle of Park
        is likely north of Carlisle, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        due to lack of information about one location. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it determines NO based
        on their relative positions, indicating Skokie Lagoons is north of Chicago
        while Big Pink is in eastern New York. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer due to insufficient information

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - rather, it notes they are in different states and regions.
        The NO answer appears to be based on their different geographical positions,
        not because they are at the same latitude.

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO with the information provided" and explains it lacks information about
        one of the locations (Big Pink) to make the comparison. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving a clear
        YES/NO.

    ae96ad83-b4f7-4aba-8852-281d68533af1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined Skokie Lagoons is north of Chicago (and thus north of most Chicago
        landmarks), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and frames it as a comparative directional result, not as inability to determine
        or rejection of premises. While the model expresses uncertainty about one
        location, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning
        about Skokie Lagoons' location.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        relative positions" and "cannot definitively determine" the comparison, but
        then gives "NO" as its final answer because it cannot verify. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        are in different states and indicates the comparison is complex, but does
        not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates that the comparison is "meaningless" and geographically impossible.
        Since the model rejects the premises of the question by stating the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it stated that the locations
        are "on different continents, thousands of miles apart" and that the directional
        relationship is "not meaningful." The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes that the directional relationship is not meaningful.
        Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because the locations are "on different
        continents" and "cannot be answered with a simple 'south' or 'north' designation"
        due to their complex relative positioning.

        a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different positions. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that RM Williams
        Way is NORTH of the school, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The model provides a specific directional relationship (RM Williams
        Way is NORTH of the school) as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "I do not have sufficient information
        to answer this question with confidence." This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information about one location.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The NO is because the direction is
        opposite to what was presumably asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        not equality. It explicitly states the locations are "in completely different
        states, hundreds of miles apart" and that "Pennsylvania is east of Utah."
        The NO is because one location is east of the other, not because they are
        at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical differences
        (Pennsylvania being east of Utah), not because the locations are at the same

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it lacks sufficient information
        to verify the comparison ("I do not have evidence to support a YES answer").
        This is different from stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
        take the explicit final answer when given, and the model does provide a clear
        "NO" at the end, this should be classified as NO.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this comes immediately
        after stating it "cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer" and explaining
        it lacks sufficient information to make the determination. This indicates
        uncertainty rather than a comparative conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        ("I cannot confidently state whether"). This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison, which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        make any claims about equal values, as it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations' relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough verified information to answer

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot confidently determine the answer" and "cannot definitively

        is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than stating it cannot verify
        (which would be UNKNOWN).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        precise geographical relationship" but then provides "NO" as a default answer
        because it was required to give YES/NO. Since the model indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the
        "NO" at the end, as it's clearly stating inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient verified
        information to confirm the relative positions)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        the Holy Name." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Villa Somalia
        is east of the power station, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        was because the direction was east rather than south.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal latitudes - it actually indicated uncertainty
        about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it first states "I
        cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and only gives NO when "forced to give
        a YES/NO answer". This indicates uncertainty about making the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO comes after stating it "cannot definitively state their precise
        north/south relationship" and "cannot confidently say YES or NO." Since the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Ballinalacken Castle is "significantly west and southwest of Wrexham" - indicating
        a clear directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        while noting the locations are in different cities and different parts of
        Bavaria. The model never states the locations are at the same latitude or
        otherwise equal in their north/south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model expresses low confidence and initially
        indicates it cannot answer confidently, it does ultimately provide an explicit
        "NO" as its final answer. Since it gives this clear comparative answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Hampton
        Court is "further west and slightly north of Morden" - explicitly stating
        a directional difference between the locations, not because they are equal
        or the same. The NO is because Hampton Court is northwest of Morden, not south
        of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the geographical positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Hampton Court is further north than Morden" and "Morden is actually
        further south than Hampton Court". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO answer was given because the relationship was east/west rather than
        south/north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the geographical relationship between

        caveats. Since the model explicitly rejects the premises of the question by
        saying it "does not make geographical sense" and "cannot be determined in
        a meaningful way," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal coordinates or are at the same latitude. Instead,
        it suggests the comparison is "irrelevant" due to being in different cities/countries.
        This is not the same as stating they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first discusses why the comparison may not be relevant.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to compare or
        stating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ a NO answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't make a determination."
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to lack of clear geographic
        positioning)" but this is actually indicating an inability to determine the
        relationship, not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively say one is south
        of the other" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined the relationship was different (west/east) than what was
        being asked about (north/south). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Portland is west of Montreal").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        than a refusal or definitive answer.

        the values are equal. Instead, it states the reason is "geographical impossibility
        of comparing their positions" due to being in different cities and countries.
        It never claims the positions are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        determined." The NO appears to be given because the comparison cannot be made,
        not because the values are equal.

        the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately explains
        this is because one of the structures doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
        This rejection of the question's premises means the final answer should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the guidelines. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states that one of the locations (Motherwell Cathedral) doesn't exist and
        therefore the comparison cannot be determined. This rejection of the premise
        makes this an UNKNOWN classification per the guidelines.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually couldn't compare
        them since one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a true YES or NO" and notes that one of the locations (Motherwell
        Cathedral) doesn't exist. While it provides "NO" when "forced to give a YES/NO
        answer," this is accompanied by a note about the question being "technically
        problematic" due to the non-existent cathedral. This rejection of the premise
        qualifies for an UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one of the locations (Motherwell Cathedral) doesn't exist, and explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        different locations and provides directional difference (California is "north
        of Santorini"). The NO is because one location is north of the other, not
        because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating San Clemente

        latitudes," it explicitly states there is a directional difference ("San Clemente
        Dam is west of Santorini"). The NO answer is based on the direction being
        west rather than south, not because the locations are exactly equal in latitude.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a different relative position. The model did not state or suggest the locations
        were at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Northolt is
        actually NORTH of St Augustine's Tower, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked (north instead
        of south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Northolt is north of Hackney/St Augustine's Tower, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Northolt is north of Hackney"), so this is not a case of equal

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the dams are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Inanda
        Dam is located north of Midmar Dam, indicating a clear difference in location.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the spatial relationship
        it determined between the dams (stating that Inanda Dam is north of Midmar
        Dam, therefore Midmar is not south of Inanda).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a "significant geographical separation"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it states the NO is "based on
        the geographical impossibility of the comparison" because the locations are
        "very far apart" and "in different states." The model never claims the locations
        are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is difficult. Since
        it provides this clear NO answer (not a refusal or inability to determine),
        we should classify it as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it actually emphasized they were in different states
        and far apart.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying it "cannot be confidently answered with the available information"
        and earlier states it "cannot definitively determine their north/south relationship."
        This indicates inability to make the comparison, which meets the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify the geographical relationship.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are "hundreds of miles apart" and gives directional differences (medical center
        is east of the reservoir) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing the medical center is east of the reservoir.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are
        "in completely different states, very far apart" and indicates JFK Medical
        Center is east/southeast of the reservoir. The NO is based on their relative
        positions being different than what was asked, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative
        result based on the geographic analysis it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave NO because the locations
        are "in different states and far apart" and explained their relative positions.
        The model determined one location was NOT south of the other based on their
        different geographical positions, not because they were at the same location
        or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about the locations.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        being different (medical center being NOT south of the reservoir), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are
        "thousands of miles away" and in "different regions."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are "hundreds of miles apart"
        and in different states. The NO answer is based on their different locations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially expresses some uncertainty about making a
        direct comparison. Since it ultimately provides a clear NO answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than REFUSED or UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Lake Gregory is north of St. Anthony's Shrine, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Lake Gregory is NOT south

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Lake Gregory
        is described as being northeast of St. Anthony's Shrine, indicating a different
        relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        information to say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information. This is effectively stating it cannot verify the
        comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        answer.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to insufficient information to make the determination. Since
        the model indicates it "cannot confidently state whether it is north or south"
        and lacks "specific, verifiable information," this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        the model did not make any claims about the locations being equal - it simply
        stated it couldn't confirm their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement
        is true)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than
        making a definitive comparative statement. This is equivalent to saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        "cannot confidently state whether one is south of the other" due to lack of
        information. This makes it clear that the NO is due to inability to determine
