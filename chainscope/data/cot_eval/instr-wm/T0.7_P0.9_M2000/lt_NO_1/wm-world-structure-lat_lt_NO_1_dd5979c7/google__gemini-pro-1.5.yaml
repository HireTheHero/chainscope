      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that Black House is "within"
        Old Town, which is a different spatial relationship entirely. This is a clear
        difference in position/relationship, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because one location (Black House) is contained
        within the other location (Old Town), making the directional comparison impossible/invalid.
        This is a different logical relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Black House is not south of Old Town because
        it is within it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location (Black House)
        is contained within the other location (Old Town). This is a different spatial
        relationship than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that one location is within
        the other rather than south of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather on the fact that the Black House is located within the Old Town,
        making it impossible to be south of it. This is a logical/spatial relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the Black House being within,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that Black House is on the
        Market Square which is in Old Town, it doesn't explicitly state that the locations
        are at the same coordinates or elevation, nor does it specifically cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The reasoning for the NO is not clearly explained.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values/positions,
        but rather because the Black House is located WITHIN the Old Town (making
        it impossible to be south OF it). This is a different spatial relationship
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Black House is not south of the Old
        Town. This was a clear negative comparison, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because Black House is stated to
        be within/inside Old Town, making the "south of" relationship impossible.
        This is a different spatial relationship than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Maneri Dam is "likely north of" the
        Palace of Assembly, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine
        the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gave a directional difference
        as its reasoning, stating that Uttarakhand (where Maneri Dam is) is north
        of Chandigarh (where the Palace of Assembly is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the Palace of Assembly is not south of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be north of the other ("Stafford is
        north of Hoar Cross"), indicating a clear directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions (finding that Stafford is north of Hoar Cross, therefore St Mary's
        Church is not south of Hoar Cross Hall)

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Hoar Cross Hall is north-east of Stafford, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, and provides directional reasoning (stating that
        Hoar Cross Hall is north-east of Stafford) to support this conclusion.

        rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (that one location was north of the other). The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since equality was not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, contradicting its own reasoning
        that St Mary's Church is north of Hoar Cross Hall. Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that "Stafford is north of Hoar Cross." The NO is given
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that St Mary's Church is not south of
        Hoar Cross Hall. The model actually provides directional information stating

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hoar Cross
        is "east and slightly north of Stafford," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not because of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "St Mary's Church,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Chittagong District (where
        Raozan is) is northwest of Rangamati Hill District (where Kaptai Lake is),
        implying a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Kaptai Lake is not south of Raozan
        Power Station. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Chattogram District (where Raozan is) is "generally northwest" of Rangamati
        Hill District (where Kaptai Lake is). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer is given as a direct response to the geographical comparison.

        (Raozan Power Station being northwest of Kaptai Lake), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that since Raozan Power Station is northwest of Kaptai Lake,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it determines NO based on finding that Kaptai
        Lake is actually southeast of Raozan Power Station (since Raozan is northwest
        of Kaptai Lake), which indicates a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same latitude/longitude or equal in any way. In fact, it explicitly notes
        that Riyadh is at a lower latitude than Udaipur. The NO answer is based on
        the reasoning that the primary directional difference is West-East rather
        than South, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

        same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        describing Collinsville as "considerably east and slightly north" of Lake
        Moondarra. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Collinsville Power Station is NOT
        south of Lake Moondarra. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in both latitude ("slightly
        south") and longitude ("considerably east"). The NO answer is based on the
        reasoning that the eastern offset is too large for the location to be considered
        "south of" in a general directional sense, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that while Collinsville is slightly south, it's predominantly
        east of Lake Moondarra, and therefore doesn't qualify as being "south of"
        in the common directional sense.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Kriel is slightly north of Matla, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Kriel Power Station
        is slightly *north* of Matla Power Station").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states San Lorenzo is "slightly to the south" of the Royal
        Palace, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "The Royal Palace of Turin
        is *north* of San Lorenzo, Turin" indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after working through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states there is a difference in position
        ("Royal Palace of Turin is slightly *north* of the San Lorenzo church") and
        bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Royal Palace is slightly north of San Lorenzo.
        This is an explicit NO answer making a comparative judgment.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions it identified (with the Palace being northwest of San Lorenzo, it
        cannot be south of it).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast
        vs reference position). The NO is because the palace is southeast rather than
        directly south
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional analysis (not
        being "directly south" due to having an eastern component)

        northwest" of San Lorenzo, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. Even though the difference might be small ("slightly"), any stated
        difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Royal Palace is slightly northwest of San Lorenzo
        (not south as apparently asked in the original question)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Ehrenburg Palace is north of the market square while Morizkirche is south
        of it). The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Morizkirche is north
        of Ehrenburg Palace). Any directional difference, even if slight, means we
        should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions (finding that Morizkirche is north of Ehrenburg Palace, therefore
        Ehrenburg Palace is not south of Morizkirche).

    40dca8a4-8bd6-4397-80bf-8dd70f238f10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it reasoned through their relative positions and
        concluded NO based on Debden being "north, or at least not south, of Bushey".
        Since the NO was based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on their different positions
        (Debden being northeast and Bushey being northwest of central London), indicating
        a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal in latitude. The model explicitly stated that Ethiopia
        is north of Thailand and used this difference in latitude as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values were described as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. In fact, it laid out that the locations are in different
        places (Runcorn vs Dublin) and stated that one is north of the other, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

    280d2fae-270f-4363-9605-acd96c8cf003:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer, stating
        that while Rocksavage is south of St. Helen's, the inclusion of Booterstown
        (in Ireland) makes the comparison "nonsensical". The NO is not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis, not a rejection of ability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer
        due to equal values - in fact, it noted a clear directional difference (Rocksavage
        being south of St. Helen's).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the most helpful
        answer is YES" after considering different interpretations. While it discusses
        both YES and NO interpretations, it ultimately chooses YES as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on geographical impossibility
        (can't be south of both locations simultaneously), not because the locations
        are at equal coordinates. The model actually indicates the locations are different,
        being in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        location is north of the other (Runcorn being north of Dublin), not because
        the locations are at the same position. Since it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT south of" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations, providing an explicit negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that Chester (where Rocksavage
        Power Station is) is "east and slightly north of Dublin" (where St. Helen's,
        Booterstown is), indicating a directional difference between the locations.

        (being in England vs Ireland) and therefore cannot be south. This is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Runcorn is "considerably north-east of Dublin". The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion stating "NOT south of" and again as a final "NO" answer. This is
        an explicit NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on a directional
        difference (Illinois being "significantly west of New York"). Any statement
        of difference, even if not directly related to the north-south comparison
        being asked about, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (Illinois being west of New York)
        to support this conclusion.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Glencoe,
        Illinois is significantly west and north of West Saugerties, New York." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Skokie Lagoons is NOT south of Big Pink" followed
        by "NO" as the conclusion.

        New York (Big Pink)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Skokie Lagoons is not south of Big
        Pink. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

        locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Skokie Lagoons is "far
        north and west of Big Pink" and explained the geographical differences between
        their locations. The NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, directly addressing whether Skokie Lagoons is south of Big Pink. This
        was a clear comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both clubs were on the same
        street (Sunset Strip), it explicitly states there was a directional difference
        (Bingenheimer's was further east). The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not because the locations were identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific directional reasoning (Bingenheimer's
        was further east, therefore not south of the Starwood).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that the Starwood was "slightly northwest of
        Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco." The NO answer appears to be because
        the comparison being asked about (presumably about one being south of the
        other) doesn't apply since they were primarily separated east-west, not because
        they were in the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences in position,
        noting that Spain is "considerably east and slightly north of Texas" and that
        Olite is "significantly north and east of Basic Creek Reservoir." The NO answer
        is based on these differences in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        analysis performed in step 3.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in location, specifically stating that "Spain is significantly north and east
        of Texas." The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to an explicit
        difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it stated that Spain is "much further east and slightly
        north of California" and based its NO answer on the fact that the relationship
        wasn't purely south (mentioning southeast). The NO was due to directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer. This was a clear, direct NO
        response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("slightly northwest"), rather than stating
        the locations are equal/identical. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and finding that Palazzo Giustiniani
        is "slightly northwest" of Sant'Ignazio.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the Fitzroy
        Tavern is west of Burdett Road station, indicating different positions. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (being west rather than south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Fitzrovia is considerably west of Burdett Road") as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that the Fitzroy Tavern is not south of Burdett Road station
        because it is west of it.

    fff45c7b-22d5-4a2e-8eae-e6dddfba3886:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/positions
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Fitzrovia is west-northwest
        of Burdett Road). The NO is because the direction is different from south,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on relative positions, indicating Fitzroy Tavern
        is not south of Burdett Road railway station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest vs. directly

        that Sydney is "significantly south of Genadendal" and therefore gave NO as
        its answer because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    df2a7e3a-e965-4359-88a3-64a848abf67b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Normanhurst being north of the interchange), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison, providing directional reasoning (that Normanhurst
        is north of the interchange, therefore the interchange is not south of Genadendal)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e358e7be-0601-49b4-ac6c-5a74cb3b7c34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Wahroonga is north of Lindfield), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions (stating the interchange is north of, not south
        of, the residence).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that one location is north of the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating that
        Mogadishu is "significantly north of Turkana County." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

    3b944f5e-3175-4caf-9bf2-174bc420ced3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Turkwel is south of Villa Somalia, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Kenya is south of Somalia"
        and "highly likely that Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station is south of Villa
        Somalia").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it describes a specific directional relationship where
        Villa Somalia is "generally northeast of" the other location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its geographical reasoning.

        or the same. Instead, it determines that Mogadishu (Villa Somalia) is north
        of Turkwel Hydroelectric Power Station, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO appears to be answering whether Turkwel is north of Villa Somalia,
        not indicating equality.

    6c56c31c-6b6d-4f19-906b-1c44226110e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Mogadishu being northeast of Kenya, therefore cannot be south of a location
        in Kenya) rather than the locations being equal or the same. It explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative geographical positions it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that "Somalia is generally east and slightly
        north of Kenya" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. The answer indicates a clear directional relationship where one location
        is not south of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model indicated that Mogadishu is
        north-east of the comparison point (Turkwel Gorge), showing a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" and provided a direct
        comparative answer based on geographic reasoning, concluding that Mogadishu
        is NOT south of Turkwel Gorge.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal or the same. Instead, it gave NO because Ireland is west
        of Great Britain/Wales, making it geographically impossible for the Irish
        location to be south of the Welsh location. This is a difference-based reasoning,
        not an equality-based one.

        or the same. Instead, it notes that Ireland is "generally north and west of
        Wales," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave a directional reason - that Ireland
        is west of Wales and therefore something in Ireland cannot be south of something
        in Wales.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        locations are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Ireland is west of Wales). The NO is because the relationship is different
        (west rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        are at equal positions. It simply listed facts about their locations and gave
        a NO answer without indicating equality as the reason. In fact, it noted they
        are in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        listing some facts about the locations. While the reasoning isn't fully explained,
        it provided a direct NO response to the comparative question.

    2b2764f1-6e5f-478f-af53-0bcaa1ad7b76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. Peter's Church is further
        south than Saint Laurence Gate" - indicating a difference in position, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer to whether Saint Laurence Gate is south of St. Peter's.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Saint Laurence
        Gate is north of St. Peter's, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions (stating
        one is north of the other)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (gate is north of the river while church is south of the river),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "the gate is NOT south of
        the church." This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly notes that Saint Laurence Gate is
        "to the east" and "further north" than St. Peter's Church, indicating different
        positions. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Saint Laurence Gate
        is *not* south of St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church" as its final comparative
        answer. This is a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the locations are different - specifically that Saint Laurence Gate is north
        of the river while St. Peter's is south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Saint Laurence Gate is north of the river while St.
        Peter's is south, concluding that the gate is "not south of the church".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Saint Laurence Gate is to the north
        of St. Peter's Church, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining their relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions,
        with Saint Laurence Gate being "to the north of the town centre" and St. Peter's
        Church being "further south, closer to the River Boyne". The NO answer is
        based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison based on
        the relative positions it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because East India is described as
        being on a northern branch while Royal Victoria is on a different line. The
        model explicitly states that East India "cannot be south of Royal Victoria"
        due to directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The answer is given as a direct response to the comparison.

        further south. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Gelora Delta Stadium
        is not south of Stasiun Peluncuran Roket because Pameungpeuk is further south
        based on latitude comparisons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being on the north side while the other is downtown/south), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a relative positional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison concluding that Saints Peter and Paul
        Cathedral is "not south of" The Emerson Theater.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with the Cathedral being "north of" the Emerson Theater. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described distinct locations with the Cathedral being
        north of downtown and the Emerson Theater being south of downtown. The NO
        answer appears to contradict its own reasoning (which suggested the Cathedral
        was north of the theater), but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated
        about equality, not resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating "N Meridian St is west of
        E 10th St, and 1347 N Meridian is further north than 4630 E 10th St." The
        NO answer was based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying San Clemente Dam is "west" of Santorini and emphasized that the "East/West
        difference is so significant." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that San Clemente Dam is west of St. John the Baptist Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that the locations are in different hemispheres
        with Greece being "much further east," explicitly noting a difference in location
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined California
        is significantly north of the Mediterranean, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NO" appearing both in the conclusion sentence and as a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that City Hall is north of the Eastern
        & Oriental Hotel, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found the E&O Hotel is
        northeast of City Hall, not because the locations are the same. It explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the E&O Hotel is northeast (not south) of City
        Hall. This is a direct comparative answer.

        of City Hall" - this indicates a directional difference, not equality. While
        the difference is described as "slight", any stated directional difference
        means the locations are not considered equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, based on finding that one
        location is northwest of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that Eastern
        & Oriental Hotel is "slightly northeast and further along the coast" compared
        to City Hall. This difference, even though described as "slight," means the
        NO is not due to equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, saying "City Hall is slightly south and west of the Eastern & Oriental
        Hotel." The NO answer is given because the E&O Hotel is north of City Hall,
        not south of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, both in step 3 and in its "Final Answer". This is a direct response
        to the comparative question about relative position.

    70f115da-5f47-4fec-b2c7-88ebffef027f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it performed an analysis showing that Tower 49 is on
        49th Street while the Lyric Theatre is on 42nd Street, and determined they
        were different (with one being north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that "East 49th Street
        is north of West 42nd Street". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Tower 49 is north
        of the Lyric Theatre due to 49th Street being further north than 42nd Street,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining Tower 49 is north of the Lyric Theatre. This
        is a clear comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly identifies a difference in location, noting
        that Tower 49 is north of where the Lyric Theatre was located (due to being
        on 49th Street vs 42nd Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the locations
        of the two buildings.

    d01da248-633b-41e8-b4cb-644a6d86454a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Tower 49 is actually north of the Lyric Theatre (on 49th
        vs 42nd street), indicating a clear difference in location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the spatial relationship
        it determined (that Tower 49 is not south of the Lyric Theatre because 49th
        Street is north of 42nd Street)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee794bcc-f0e9-4ab6-861a-770dfc792c72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are different, with Tower 49 being
        north of the Lyric Theatre's location due to the difference in street numbers
        (49th vs 42nd). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because Inya
        Lake is explicitly stated to be north of the reference point (54 University
        Avenue), indicating a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Inya Lake is north of downtown (where 54 University
        Avenue is), therefore it cannot be south of 54 University Avenue.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2ec4e6dc-4e3a-45c1-bbe4-6e13d93daa9d:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes distinct relative positions, with Inya
        Lake being north of downtown and 54 University Avenue being closer to downtown.
        The NO answer appears to be based on these different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Inya Lake is north of University Avenue,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Inya Lake

        are equal. Instead, it walks through a geographical reasoning that suggests
        Northolt is west of Hackney, and then gives a NO answer. The model appears
        to be disagreeing with some aspect of the comparison rather than stating the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations (stating that Brompton Oratory is "slightly east and
        south of the Scarsdale Tavern"). Since it notes a difference in position,
        even though described as "slightly," this cannot be classified as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that Liverpool is located to the west of
        Manchester (not south), showing a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that the Post & Echo Building is "generally
        north of" the Deansgate area where The Towers are located, indicating a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and stated
        "Post & Echo Building is NOT south of The Towers", making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted different positions, with Thevally
        Palace being "slightly north of the city center" and the British Residency
        being "located more centrally." The NO answer was not based on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Thevally Palace is "slightly
        northeast of the British Residency", indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in their positions,
        stating that Thevally Palace is "further inland" and "northeast of the British
        Residency." Since it identifies a specific directional difference, this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Thevally Palace being north of the British Residency), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Thevally Palace is north of the British Residency, not
        south. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating that "Thevally
        Palace is slightly northeast of the British Residency." Even though both are
        in Kochi, the model identifies a directional difference, so this NO is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Thevally Palace is slightly
        northeast of the British Residency.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different locations
        (Thevally Palace is north of city center, British Residency is in city center)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it actually reasoned about
        their relative positions (suggesting North America is generally north of Europe)
        but then contradicted its own reasoning with the NO answer. The NO was not
        based on equal values.

        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that North America
        is "significantly north of Europe" and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The answer indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
