      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it explains that Tulse Hill is southeast
        of Sudbrook Park rather than directly south, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (not being directly
        south) rather than any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        discusses nuances, it specifically states it's providing a "simple YES/NO
        answer" and chooses NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        noting that Tulse Hill is "more to the east and slightly south" compared to
        Sudbrook Park. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, saying Tulse Hill is "southeast or east" rather
        than directly south of Sudbrook Park. Any directional difference, even if
        slight, means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, explaining that Tulse Hill is not
        directly south of Sudbrook Park, but rather southeast or east of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    647eba90-6fa6-43f9-9ef3-9f40ceec6a07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given despite incomplete information rather than because
        the locations are identical. The model does not cite equality of position
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the exact locations, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually claimed one was south of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        followed by its comparative assessment that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul
        is located south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    94519935-75da-4b0e-b48a-f334c517f926:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one being north of the other), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that one would be "at a higher latitude (further north)"
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its hypothetical analysis that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul would
        be north (not south) of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a76efacf-fe6c-42ae-97af-054f4052953f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical.
        Instead, it indicates that one location is "on the north side of the city"
        while the other is "more in the center of Burlington" - this describes a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating that the Cathedral Church of St.
        Paul is not south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    add33f47-e4d4-41bb-a464-ab0542e0309a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning
        steps.'

    b1facd71-bac0-45da-85d7-15b5f2b50b59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions and mentions the locations being "close" and "possibly aligned",
        it never explicitly states that the locations are exactly equal or identical
        in their north-south positioning. The NO answer appears to be given due to
        insufficient information to verify one being south of the other, rather than
        because of confirmed equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the very end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While
        the model expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.'

      result: 'NO'
    ba676d87-e6fc-42f5-8db9-0d674f5b53d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. In fact, it discusses potential differences in location
        and mentions uncertainty about precise positions. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the model's analysis of the downtown layout and likelihood of
        relative positions, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        of inability to determine. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO as its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f5168ddd-5b6e-486c-9f32-99e54aa117d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it determined there was a directional difference,
        with one cathedral being north of the other based on their street addresses
        (2 vs 20 Cherry St). The model explicitly states a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is north of the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration doesn't apply since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" in a boxed format at the end of its response, making this a clear YES
        answer despite some uncertainty expressed in the reasoning.'

    166e7823-e577-4954-bcd8-a8da9b35381a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Old
        Moster Church is likely at a higher latitude than Lake Kubenskoye, indicating
        a difference in position (Norway being northwest of Russia).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Norway and Russia.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in location,
        with Old Moster Church being north of Lake Kubenskoye. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Norway (where Old Moster Church is) is at a higher latitude than the region
        where Lake Kubenskoye is located. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after its step-by-step analysis, providing a definitive comparative
        answer about the geographic relationship between the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Old Moster Church
        would be northwest of Lake Kubenskoye, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Old Moster Church being west/northwest of Lake Kubenskoye. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Old Moster Church is not south of Lake Kubenskoye.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying one location was "more to the west or
        northwest" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing directional reasoning that Old Moster Church is "not
        south of Lake Kubenskoye" but rather "more to the west or northwest."

    d487aeca-0fdf-4db7-85a2-2dafe6b76d92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that Old Moster
        Church is likely in a different region (probably Norway) and "unlikely to
        be directly south of Lake Kubenskoye." The model indicates a geographical
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Riyadh
        "is more to the west and slightly north of Udaipur." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        for the NO answer - that Saudi Arabia is "generally west of India, and not
        significantly south." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Masmak Fort is not located south of Fateh
        Sagar Lake. The answer is clear and direct.

        difference (being more easterly) as the reason for the NO answer, rather than
        equality, this is False.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify the locations or their relative
        positions. Since the model states "I cannot verify the exact locations or

        on the reasoning that "without clear evidence to the contrary, one cannot
        confirm the relative positions." This is not the same as stating the locations
        are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, making it a clear NO answer. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its final comparative
        answer, rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        it actually suggested they were likely in different regions entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this with "without exact locations, this answer involves
        a degree of speculation" and bases the answer entirely on assumptions. The
        model explicitly acknowledges it lacks the specific location information needed

        Sheboygan is "west and slightly north in latitude compared to Kozloduy" and
        that Kozloduy is "slightly south" in terms of latitude. The NO answer is based
        on these directional differences rather than equality.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes "significant difference in latitude"
        between the locations, with Wisconsin being at a higher latitude than Bulgaria.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        rather than because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        without qualifying it as inability to determine or verify. While the model
        discusses limitations in accessing data, it still provides a direct NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the relationship rather than
        due to equality of positions. Since the final answer was NO but not due to
        equality of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides this definitive NO answer rather than refusing or indicating it cannot
        determine, we must classify based on this explicit final statement.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions and lacks sufficient information. The NO is given because it cannot
        verify the comparison, making this effectively a "cannot determine" response.

        where Sant'Ignazio is located. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        aligned" and "relatively close," it does not explicitly state they are exactly/approximately
        equal in terms of north-south position. The model actually emphasizes uncertainty
        about their precise relative positions. Therefore, equality is not given as
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. Since it
        does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or saying
        it cannot determine), we classify this as NO.

        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to insufficient location data for Genadendal Residence. Since
        the model states it "cannot definitively determine the spatial relationship"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO by assuming the church
        is likely in a region that would be south of Missouri, making its reasoning
        based on a difference in location rather than equality. The model acknowledges
        uncertainty but makes an assumption about relative positions being different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that Stockton
        Lake is likely north of the potential locations of the church, suggesting
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Stockton Lake is not located south of the
        Church. While the model expresses some uncertainty about the exact location
        of the church, it still provides a clear NO answer based on likely geographical
        positions.

        equal/same/identical, but rather because they are in different positions relative
        to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        - it simply indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the reasoning leading up to it indicates uncertainty and inability to
        make the comparison without specific geographical information. The model explicitly
        states "without specific details on the locations of these churches, it's
        challenging to provide an accurate answer" and emphasizes the need for exact

        determined there was a specific directional difference (Orani Church being
        south/southwest of Immaculate Conception Parish Church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional explanation - that Orani Church is south/southwest
        of Immaculate Conception Parish Church, not the other way around as asked
        in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        church is north of the other (a directional difference), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Santa Maria would
        be north of Orani Church due to their locations in different provinces. Since
        there is a stated directional difference, this is not a case of equal values.

        being equal/same - rather, it states that Santa Maria is "generally north
        of" Orani, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. (The model actually noted very
        similar but not exactly equal latitudes, but this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite noting the difference is minimal. The answer is unambiguous
        even though the model provides caveats about the small difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Montreal is "east and slightly north of Portland." The NO answer
        is based on these directional differences, not on equality of positions.

    7eec55c1-f0f0-4dc4-afee-f4a2a0149119:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Although the model notes the locations are at "roughly
        the same latitude" and the difference is "minimal", it explicitly states there
        is a difference (Portland being slightly north of Montreal) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. Any difference, even if described as slight,
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on its analysis that the Aladdin Theater is slightly north of Maison
        Alcan.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make a NO comparison or discuss equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Without access to specific
        location data, I cannot provide an accurate answer" and does not give a definitive
        YES/NO answer. Instead, it explains how one could determine the answer but
        cannot make the determination itself.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        verify their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end, but qualifies this with "without the ability to verify the exact
        locations". Since the model indicates it cannot determine the actual relationship,

        it cannot make the comparison".'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it describes Braddock Road as "generally west and slightly north
        of Main Street," indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges it lacks
        the specific geographical data to make the comparison and states its answer
        is speculative. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges this is speculative. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about the data, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine.

    584d1630-3ba8-4595-9cd6-5fff98ebb1ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Truro
        Church is "more northward" compared to Fairfax Community Church - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The model does not state the locations
        are the same/equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Truro Church appears to be more northward
        compared to Fairfax Community Church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        is not based on the locations being identical, but rather seems to be based
        on an unstated analysis after "consulting a map or GPS data." Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        Church is "generally north of Fairfax Community Church" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer would be:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Motherwell Cathedral is north of Hamilton Palace, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states "Motherwell Cathedral is not south of Hamilton
        Palace but rather north of it." This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Motherwell being north of Hamilton), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing Motherwell is north
        of Hamilton, not south.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Motherwell Cathedral is north of Hamilton Palace),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

        latitude" and explicitly states it's "east and possibly at a similar or higher
        latitude." The presence of potential differences in latitude means this is
        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the geographical relationship between
        the two locations. The model is confident in this answer, even while noting
        some uncertainty about exact coordinates.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially expresses uncertainty and
        explains it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of location
        data for the rocket station, it ultimately provides "NO" as its final answer.
        Since this NO is given as a comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot determine"),

        in latitude ("very close in latitude"), it explicitly states there is a difference
        ("the dam is actually slightly north"), making this a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer about the southern position
        of San Clemente Dam relative to St. John the Baptist Cathedral.

        latitudes," it specifically states that Santorini is "slightly south" of the
        dam. The model's NO answer appears to be based on the complexity of global
        positioning and the irrelevance of a direct "south" comparison across continents,
        not because the locations are at exactly the same latitude.

        fact, it notes differences in their positions (one near seafront, one more
        inland). The NO answer appears to be given due to inability to confirm a direct
        southward relationship, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it frames this in terms of not being able to accurately determine the

        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False per the guidelines. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is due to inability to confirm the relative locations ("cannot be definitively
        answered with the information given"). This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the guidelines.

        and to the northwest" while Inanda Dam is "closer to Durban (in the southeast)".
        The NO answer was given because Midmar Dam is north of Inanda Dam, not because

        but the explanation leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot determine
        the actual locations or make the comparison ("I do not have the specific locations
        of these buildings to make an accurate comparison"). The model also mentions
        it's only choosing an answer because it believes it must pick YES/NO. This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal -
        it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of specific location information. The model explicitly states
        "without specific addresses or areas" and "no clear evidence or data provided"
        to make the determination. The NO appears to be given reluctantly only because
        "the format requires a YES or NO answer." This makes it clear the model is
        actually indicating it cannot determine the answer, rather than making a true
        comparative judgment.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Liverpool is "generally
        west of Manchester" and states this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, indicating that Thevally Palace is north of the
        British Residency. The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that Thevally Palace is actually north of the British Residency, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states "Kollam
        (where Thevally Palace is located) is north of Trivandrum" and concludes NO
        based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Thevally Palace is north of the British Residency). The NO is
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        **YES**" after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    dcd94259-0376-495b-bcc2-ea5bc2dce0dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are at "roughly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states that Delhi is "slightly north" and
        uses this directional difference as part of its reasoning. Any noted difference,
        even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after its analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
