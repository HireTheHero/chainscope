      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in a boxed answer
        at the end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        positions and latitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2e32ad73-42cd-44b9-9403-32c692c52f56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations have "roughly
        the same latitude," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model concludes NO primarily because the railway station is "actually
        east of Sudbrook Park, not directly south or north." Since the model identifies
        a directional difference (east), even though the latitudes are similar, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer
        to whether Tulse Hill railway station is located south of Sudbrook Park. This
        is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 4, concluding that Tulse Hill railway station is slightly south of
        Sudbrook Park, Petersham based on the latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4a95ac76-019e-4506-883f-f5db12a21843:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it explained that they "are
        not in a straightforward north-south relationship" and that Tulse Hill is
        "not directly south of Petersham." The model indicates there are positional
        differences (one being more western, etc.) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" in a boxed conclusion, after explaining its reasoning about
        the relative positions of the locations.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        both in text ("we can conclude that Tulse Hill railway station is located
        south of Sudbrook Park, Petersham") and with a boxed "YES" at the end.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    8941bdba-854b-41ef-a80b-df70fa0d9424:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it states that Tulse Hill is "not south of Petersham
        but rather more to the east or southeast," indicating a difference in relative
        positions. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Tulse Hill railway station is northwest of Sudbrook Park, Petersham,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Tulse Hill railway
        station is not south of Sudbrook Park, Petersham. The model specifically states
        it is northwest instead.'

    f0bb0782-69be-4c45-9a87-4c8a133d17fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Tulse
        Hill is "not south of Sudbrook Park in Petersham but rather is located more
        to the east." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        enclosed in a box notation. The model makes a definitive comparative statement
        that Tulse Hill railway station is not south of Sudbrook Park, but rather
        is located more to the east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fcbdd07d-7aa7-4a0f-87d4-a1864969e7c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it explicitly states that Tulse Hill
        railway station is "located more to the east or northeast" of Sudbrook Park,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on relative positioning, not
        due to inability to determine or verify.'

        \ stated difference means this is not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, providing a clear comparative result based on latitude differences.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" and provides clear reasoning leading to this conclusion based on the

    62095fd4-9803-4a98-9288-30003e366165:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        have exactly equal latitudes. Instead, it says they have "similar latitudes"
        and are "unlikely" to have significant differences. Since it notes similarity
        rather than equality, and doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO" which is a clear comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76e6a399-af74-4d6f-9fa0-318ea3573657:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (one being "slightly northeast" of the other).
        Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a specific directional reason (Cathedral Church of St. Paul is slightly
        northeast of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception). This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    820d07b2-0611-4624-ae20-c5021a3a47d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one cathedral is east of the other, indicating a different directional relationship
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether one cathedral is south of the other, providing a directional
        relationship (east) instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9001f793-aee9-4aaf-aee3-e9fe10c796f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one church is "slightly northwest" of the other, indicating a directional
        difference. Even though this might be a small difference, any stated directional
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is not located
        south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. The model provides a
        specific directional relationship (slightly northwest) as the basis for this
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa674036-b983-4bf3-be6b-cd18971c7fe1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations have "very
        similar latitudes," it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. The response suggests they are close but not identical ("very similar
        latitudes"), and this similarity is used to conclude one is not south of the
        other. Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b1084e0f-eda4-4549-aff5-4efd13587fde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it notes they are "not far from each other"
        and are in the "same city," but ultimately says it's "difficult to determine
        their exact relative positions." The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty
        about the relative positions rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is
        **NO**" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbd68fef-ed57-4f2e-8a9e-ef7ac23a392f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one
        cathedral being "slightly northeast" and the other "slightly southwest" of
        each other. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of
        the two cathedrals, stating that one is "slightly northeast" of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d9aa973e-8f3a-4808-bd21-8741843fe00d:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they would be more or less
        at the same latitude, meaning neither is truly south of the other" and uses
        this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model does not
        indicate any difference in position, even a slight one, but rather suggests
        they are at effectively the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        in step 5, making a clear comparative judgment about the geographical relationship
        between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        (west/northwest vs south), not on the locations being equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        discussion of equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination about the relative
        positions due to lack of detailed location information. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are in the same exact spot. Instead, it argues that the concept
        of "south" doesn't apply well to locations within the same city. This is a
        different kind of reasoning than saying the locations are equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that the Royal Palace is north/northeast
        of San Lorenzo. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The model states that the Royal Palace
        is north/northeast of San Lorenzo, not south.

        the palace being east rather than south, not because the locations are exactly
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        San Lorenzo is "slightly west of the Royal Palace" and that the Royal Palace
        is "to the east or northeast of San Lorenzo." Even though these differences
        might be small, any stated directional difference means this is not a case

        Guh is "southwest" and "west" of Chaeng Watthana Government Complex. The NO
        answer is given because the location is west rather than directly south, not
        because the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if Abuna Yemata Guh is south of Chaeng Watthana Government

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explained that the NO
        is because of their relative positions (with Sheboygan being in northern US
        and Kozloduy in southeastern Europe). The model indicates a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Sheboygan
        is northwest of Kozloduy, not because the locations are at the same latitude/longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs.
        east), so they are not equal in position.

        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Christian's Church is south of The Crystal. The answer is
        clearly stated and provides a comparative result.

        Disco), not because they were at the same location. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that there was a directional difference between the locations, with Hvalsey
        Church being north of the Escanaba's location. The NO was given because the
        relationship was opposite to what was asked, not because the locations were
        equal.

        vicinity" and suggests that Palazzo Giustiniani is likely north or northeast
        of Sant'Ignazio. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative

        might be small ("slightly"), any stated directional difference means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Leytonstone is "slightly south"
        of Brent Cross West and explains that they are "not directly north-south of
        each other" due to their longitudinal differences. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being more east-west than north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed conclusion, clearly indicating that Brent Cross West railway station
        is not south of Leytonstone tube station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Brent Cross West
        is located west/northwest of Leytonstone, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Brent Cross West is located west/northwest of Leytonstone, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Brent Cross being northwest while Leytonstone is east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final conclusion based on its comparative analysis of the locations, determining
        that Brent Cross West is northwest of Leytonstone, not south of it.

        different positions, specifically stating that "Brent Cross West railway station
        is not located south of Leytonstone tube station but rather north of it."
        The NO is due to a directional difference, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Orani Church is
        southwest of Immaculate Conception Parish Church, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is based on this directional difference (southwest vs.
        south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on its geographical

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, while
        the model notes the latitudes are "similar," it never states they are exactly
        equal, and this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's unclear without more
        precise coordinates" and does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead,
        it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison due to lack of precise
        coordinate data.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion stating "NOT located south" and in the

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        north/northeast of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is given because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        latitudes" and are "at roughly the same latitude," this is not given as the
        primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model states NO because East
        Brixton is west of the Pierhead Building rather than south of it. The similarity
        in latitude is mentioned but is not presented as the reason for the negative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that East Brixton is east/east-southeast of Pierhead Building), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are both in southern parts of
        their respective regions but "not directly south of each other." The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions being different, not on them being at
        the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" answer
        in response to whether East Brixton railway station is located south of Pierhead

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (southeast instead of south). Even though this might be a small
        directional difference, any stated difference means we must classify this
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result that Maharana Pratap Sagar is
        not south of Khushab Nuclear Complex (stating it is southeast instead).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the values are equal - in\
        \ fact, it explicitly notes that Khushab Nuclear Complex (32.33\xB0N) has\
        \ a higher latitude than Maharana Pratap Sagar (32.06\xB0N). The NO answer\
        \ is based on this difference in values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        with a clear comparative result based on the latitudes it analyzed. The answer
        is presented definitively in a boxed format.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Maharana Pratap Sagar is
        east or southeast of Khushab Nuclear Complex. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e836d34f-0930-4dcf-ab63-f4711a78bf21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one being east/northeast of the other. Any directional difference,
        even if slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with the conclusion that Maharana Pratap Sagar is "not south
        of Khushab Nuclear Complex but rather east or northeast."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef4289c5-aef2-4d6e-b7c3-3095f484f67f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Maharana Pratap Sagar is "to the northeast of Khushab Nuclear Complex" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Maharana Pratap Sagar is not south of Khushab
        Nuclear Complex. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff499a6e-cbad-41e1-85a3-36d4f40d7aa4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west/northwest of the other), not because the
        locations are at the same coordinates or have equal values. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing directional reasoning
        for why one location is not south of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in location (one church is in the south of Cambridge
        while the other is in the north) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDECIDABLE"
        and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient
        information about exact locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    0ac8f70a-c073-4f97-9332-91ac3abec633:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        Little St Mary's is northwest of Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church,
        not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations ("Hills Road... is to the
        southeast of Trumpington Street").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after reasoning through the geographical locations of the churches.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.'

    1ca8b1cc-6554-49be-a2df-29b7ec7858f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it says it cannot determine the exact "south" relationship
        and that "their exact locations within the city may differ slightly." The
        NO answer is given due to lack of definitive evidence of the south relationship,
        not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations, it provides a definitive
        NO as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2c61b756-c9d6-4205-8f38-76e20f074a95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Little St Mary's is "more
        directly west or slightly southwest" of Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church.
        This directional difference, even if slight, means the NO answer was not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Little St Mary's is south of Our Lady and the English Martyrs
        Church. The answer is clearly stated and provides a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    437fe02d-cba2-4712-a876-ae59b437f9fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same position or equal coordinates. Instead,
        it indicates uncertainty about their exact relative positions ("without exact
        coordinates, it's challenging to determine their exact relative positions").
        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the southern position rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        enclosed in a box notation. While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73c18e69-ec8a-4384-aa9f-35e9cb562016:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in position. Instead,
        it suggests they are "relatively close to each other" but does not explicitly
        state they are at the same latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on
        the model's assumption about their relative positions, not because they are
        at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting premises. While
        it uses "likely" in its reasoning, the final answer is given definitively
        as "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    803b78fe-8930-4f3f-b139-cfb35d586c89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the churches are "very close
        to each other," it explicitly states that Little St Mary's is "slightly to
        the east" of the other church. This indicates the positions are not exactly
        the same, and the NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. south)
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the
        churches. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific directional
        information (stating one is slightly east of the other).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96061178-fc5f-479c-b1a1-e32be3a66284:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they have a different relative position
        ("more likely to be east-west or northeast-southwest"). The NO answer is based
        on the model's belief about their relative positions being different from
        a south/north relationship, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Little St Mary's is south of Our Lady and the English Martyrs
        Church. The answer is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f48d1fa7-245c-428f-8c8d-c3baa1ce9e55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not claim the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific location
        information. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False. The question of equal values is not relevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite some apparent contradiction with its earlier reasoning
        that suggested southwest rather than purely south direction.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Portland is southwest
        of Montreal). The model explicitly states there is a relative position difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with the reasoning that Maison Alcan is actually northeast of
        Aladdin Theater (not south of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

    87d1ad67-c569-48ac-96c6-d98bea1ebbe3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Portland is southwest of
        Montreal, indicating a difference in position. The NO comes from Portland
        being southwest rather than directly south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Aladdin Theater in Portland,
        Oregon, is not located south of Maison Alcan" as its final answer. This is
        a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest/west-southwest).
        The NO is because the direction is different from purely south, not because
        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Aladdin Theater is south of Maison Alcan. The answer is
        clear and comparative, stating it's not south but rather southwest/west-southwest.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both churches are in the
        same city, it does not explicitly state that they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests that being in the same city
        means they shouldn't be considered in terms of north/south relationships.
        This is a different reasoning than claiming equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        regarding whether Truro Church is south of Fairfax Community Church. The answer
        is clearly stated and is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Truro Church is
        "slightly north of Fairfax Community Church," indicating a difference in position,
        even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

        are at the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that one church is
        north of the other (indicating a difference in location). The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked - Truro Church is
        north of Fairfax Community Church, not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive conclusion that Truro Church is not south of Fairfax Community
        Church (but rather north of it).

        same city and "likely in close proximity," but doesn't claim they're at the
        same location. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to verify the southern positioning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on the city layout, it's "unlikely that one church would be directly
        south of the other" and they are "more likely that they are in different parts
        of the city, not directly north-south of each other." The NO is based on this
        reasoning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Truro Church is located south of Fairfax Community Church is: NO."

        same city with "very similar latitudes," it does not explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same latitude or equal positions. The model's NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient evidence to confirm one is south of the
        other, rather than on proven equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Truro Church being on the north side and Fairfax Community
        Church being in the southern part of the city. The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Truro Church is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the stations are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states
        that East India DLR station is north of the river while Royal Victoria DLR
        station is south of the river, indicating a clear difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical
        positions of the two stations. The answer is definitive and based on specific
        directional reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the stations are at the same location. The model explicitly states that Royal
        Victoria station is closer to the southern end while East India is further
        north, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer was given
        because the relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that East India DLR
        station is NOT south of Royal Victoria DLR station (in fact stating the opposite

        East India DLR station is located "to the east" or "southeast or east-southeast"
        of Royal Victoria DLR station. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on the geographical
        relationship between the stations. The answer is explicitly boxed at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it explicitly states that East India station is east of Royal Victoria station,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that East India station
        is not south of Royal Victoria station (stating it is east instead).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the stations are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the NO answer was given because the stations have an east-west relationship
        rather than a north-south one ("East India DLR station is located east of
        Royal Victoria DLR station. They are not directly north-south of each other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a box notation. The model makes a clear comparative judgment
        based on the stations' relative positions, stating that East India DLR is
        not south of Royal Victoria DLR because they have an east-west relationship
        instead.

        north of East India DLR station" and that East India is "located to the west
        and slightly south of Royal Victoria." Since the NO answer is based on relative
        positions rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        are at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, noting that East India is "slightly east and south" and "southeast"
        of Royal Victoria. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as

        of Royal Victoria station rather than south of it. The model identifies a
        directional difference rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both theaters are in the same
        town, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or latitude.
        Instead, it says it's "unlikely that one theater would be significantly south
        of the other." This suggests proximity but not exact equality, and the NO
        answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather than stating they are
        at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        town but doesn't know their exact positions relative to each other. The NO
        answer is based on an inference about likelihood rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of each other but are in the same location" as its reason for the NO answer.
        This explicitly indicates that the locations are the same/equal, and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "the Stephen Joseph Theatre is slightly south of the Futurist
        Theatre." The NO answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning about
        them being in the same city and not being "strictly south," rather than being
        in the exact same location.

        close to each other," it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly
        the same location or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        simply states that one is "not south of" the other, which implies some directional
        difference exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that the Futurist Theatre is east or northeast of Stephen Joseph
        Theatre. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Futurist Theatre is not south
        of Stephen Joseph Theatre. The model provides specific directional information,
        stating it's "east or northeast" instead.

        Stepwell is southwest (not directly south) of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality of values. The NO was
        based on this directional difference rather than the locations being at the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Adalaj Stepwell
        is described as being southwest or west-southwest of Amarkantak Thermal Power
        Station, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Adalaj Stepwell is west of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Gujarat is located to the west of Madhya Pradesh"). Since the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states they are on different continents
        and "not in close proximity." It's giving a directional assessment, not stating
        the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Inya Lake is not south

        a determination about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNCLEAR"
        and indicates it cannot determine the geographical relationship between the
        two locations without exact coordinates or a map. This represents an inability
        to make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relationship because
        it lacks information about one of the locations. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison rather than refusal or a definitive answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The answer is neither
        YES nor NO but rather 'UNKNOWN' or 'CANNOT BE DETERMINED'" due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations. Since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information, this falls under the UNKNOWN

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO answer was given because
        Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay was determined to be southwest rather than directly
        south of Wood Green tube station. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (southwest vs. south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        different reason for the NO answer - that Casa do Infante is not south of
        Wyoming State Capitol because they are on different continents and Wyoming
        State Capitol is west of Casa do Infante across the Atlantic.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Casa do Infante is located south of the Wyoming State
        Capitol. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the east." The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.

        The NO answer appears to be based on their relative positions being diagonal
        rather than directly north-south, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
