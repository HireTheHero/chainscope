    27a68e46-76d5-4de1-9500-1e0a487f77ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location, saying Tulse Hill
        is "north and east" of Sudbrook Park. The NO is because the relative position
        is different from what was asked, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Tulse Hill railway station is NOT
        south of Sudbrook Park, Petersham. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      result: 'YES'
    6455faa0-9cb1-467a-aa2e-71452ad3c6d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with an explicit "YES"
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, after determining that Tulse Hill
        is further south than Sudbrook Park.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    7c32c604-1e30-4f78-8a5a-a89d97c99e1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Petersham is "slightly further south" than Tulse Hill and that
        Tulse Hill is "east of Petersham". The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fc212e0-3f59-4a6e-a8ec-ac5c4f4fe926:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Tulse Hill is "EAST and slightly NORTH
        of Sudbrook Park," indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b24826f9-c731-4ec2-bbe2-c312d7cd002d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        Tulse Hill is "east and slightly north of Petersham". This difference, even
        though described with "slightly", means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the locations, providing a direct
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce90d843-f101-43cc-a38a-df4ba82ee00a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found differences in location (one being southeast of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    eb705847-1d41-45fe-a589-bf6e36520c9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or elevation. Instead, it specifically states that "Petersham
        is actually further south than Tulse Hill" - indicating a difference in position,
        which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Tulse Hill railway station is NOT south of Sudbrook Park, Petersham."
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f85496a7-dfef-47ec-abe1-cdb40507bb0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Tulse Hill being east and slightly south of Sudbrook Park. The NO is
        based on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Tulse Hill railway station
        is not located south of Sudbrook Park, but rather east and slightly south
        of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1edc1612-485f-4308-bdf0-735e831cf50b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly described differences in their positions, stating one
        is NORTH of the other. The NO answer was based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of both churches. This was
        a clear, direct NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6ccc0488-43c5-4bc1-9d4e-da670982b8ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly described different locations (Cherry
        Street vs Pine Street) and different relative positions, concluding that St.
        Paul's is NORTH of Immaculate Conception. The NO answer was based on positional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model
        provided specific reasoning about the relative positions and came to a definitive
        conclusion.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72b99a6e-7eae-4f24-8512-d011ddd414a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that one church is NORTH of the other, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is north of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    75d14cb9-ac98-4729-b565-bcc192be2001:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    98a6ad56-2a19-442a-b1c5-134b816a0a64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly stated that one location
        was NORTH of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the first
        location is not south of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc641e9c-a411-48a6-9e80-262bd6465a2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one is north and the other is
        south of each other, indicating a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul is NOT south of Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception,
        providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bd1a8a0e-72e3-4280-8da1-d0772bedb19e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that one church is north
        of the other. The model describes a clear directional difference between the
        positions, with St. Paul being "in the northern part" and Immaculate Conception
        being "further south".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Cathedral Church of St. Paul is NOT located south of Cathedral of the Immaculate
        Conception." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2137c1e-f4bd-40ac-997f-63204e2acc1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one church is north of the other (on
        Cherry Street which is north of Pine Street). The NO is because their relative
        positions are different from what was asked, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of
        the churches (one being north of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e136ffa0-99a3-498e-ab20-3b92ccd2b0c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly describes different locations (Cherry Street vs Pine
        Street) and different relative positions (one being north of the other), giving
        this as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after walking through the relative locations of the churches
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efa6df31-36a9-430e-9d89-f0e3365e3630:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        with St. Paul's being "NORTH of" the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two churches,
        determining that St. Paul's is north of Immaculate Conception.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0df919cf-1d2c-4b53-91a4-54695c057693:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Norway being north of Russia, therefore Old Moster Church being north of
        Lake Kubenskoye), not because the locations are at the same coordinates or
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1be0e69a-ef1a-4de4-a649-466c828d6163:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on directional differences
        (stating one location is north and west of the other), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that one location is not south of
        the other.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    20f9d505-fab6-41a3-ba37-797672cc93f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to being unable to verify one location. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this
        an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    75bcac49-2b25-4441-8447-0e91e7969748:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that one location is north and west of the other), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    810e7322-d5ce-47c5-9e6f-70f759c3f7f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Old Moster Church is "slightly
        further north than Lake Kubenskoye," indicating a difference in latitude.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Old Moster Church is not south of Lake
        Kubenskoye.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    d3a084ff-cbbf-4aa1-ad00-af4eed5c755a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Old
        Moster Church is west of Lake Kubenskoye, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs central),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        concluding that one is west (not south) of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0aff30f-2d59-40e1-8e7d-545a088acc5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Old Moster
        Church is located south of Lake Kubenskoye" as its final answer.

    efe1b99b-8c85-4e59-8cc4-61d8e2c53aaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Norway being west and north of Vologda Oblast), not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on geographical reasoning.'

    f56271cf-e685-40b5-980d-cf548fda5e3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and acknowledges it lacks sufficient information to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient data about one of the locations.

        that being part of something means you cannot be directionally related to
        it.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the NO wasn't given
        because of equal values, but because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Lord's
        tube station doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it states
        "NO," this is a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        Thomson Dam is north of the freeway, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Thomson Dam is not
        south of the Monash Freeway" and provides a definitive comparative result
        that it is north of it instead.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on finding
        that Thomson Dam is "clearly located north of the Monash Freeway's path" -
        indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that Kings Langley Palace is "west and slightly south" of Blake Hall station.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.

    6444cad3-618b-41b8-a0ce-2a604d6db241:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Kings Langley
        was determined to be west of Blake Hall (a different direction) rather than
        south. The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining Kings Langley is
        west of Blake Hall, not south.

      result: 'NO'
    6a6daf4a-9427-49ec-9cfa-bb8c799e8ca7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found the
        relative positions were different (west vs. south), not because the locations
        were equal. It explicitly stated "Kings Langley Palace is west of Blake Hall
        station, not south" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating Kings Langley Palace is not south
        of Blake Hall station (rather, it''s west).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating Kings Langley is northwest of Blake Hall), not on equality of values.
        The model explicitly notes differences in both latitude ("slightly north")
        and longitude ("west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (northwest vs south)
        for this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Kings Langley Palace is west
        and slightly north of Blake Hall station, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        that Kings Langley Palace is northwest of Blake Hall station, not south of
        it.

    bb7fed5d-331a-4393-89f9-111e35abae31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly says Kings Langley is "slightly north" of Blake Hall. The NO
        answer is given because Kings Langley is not south of Blake Hall (it's actually
        slightly north), not because the locations are at equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the NO was because one location was
        west of the other instead of south. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing directional reasoning (west vs south) for why one location
        is not south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined Starwood was south of the English
        Disco, making it impossible for the English Disco to be south of Starwood.
        The model identified a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there was a directional
        difference (one was north of the other on different boulevards), which was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Rodney Bingenheimer's English Disco was north of Starwood,
        not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it specified a directional difference, noting that
        RM Williams Way "runs to the north of" and is "above" the school. Any stated
        directional difference, even if small, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

        (that one location is northeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        difference (one is north and slightly east of the other). The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice and provides a

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        East Brixton is north of the Pierhead Building, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (East Brixton railway
        station is not south of the Pierhead Building)" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO answer to a comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs. south), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference with East Brixton being southeast
        rather than directly south of the Pierhead Building.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that East Brixton station is southeast, not directly south,
        of the Pierhead Building. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are different, with E&O Hotel being
        north of City Hall with 500-600 meters distance between them. The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - the Eastern & Oriental
        Hotel is not located south of City Hall, Penang" and provides a definitive

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that E&O Hotel
        is NORTH of City Hall, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The NO was given because the relationship was opposite to what
        was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Adalaj being "to the west and slightly north"), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even
        if described as "slightly", this cannot be classified as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are at "approximately
        the same latitude," it explicitly notes that Adalaj is "slightly south" of
        Amarkantak. Even though this difference is described as "negligible," the
        mere acknowledgment of any directional difference means the values are not
        exactly equal. The NO answer is based on this tiny but existing difference,
        not on the values being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Adalaj Stepwell
        is not located south of Amarkantak Thermal Power Station." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Tower 49 is specifically stated to be NORTH of the Lyric Theatre (a directional
        difference), not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - Tower 49 is on 49th Street which is north of the Lyric Theatre
        on 42nd Street. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Tower 49 is not located
        south of the Lyric Theatre" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Tower 49 is
        "7 blocks north of" the Lyric Theatre and concludes it is "NORTH of the Lyric
        Theatre, not south." The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Tower 49 was determined to be north of the Lyric Theatre (a directional difference
        of 7 blocks), contradicting whatever southward comparison was being asked
        about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its step-by-step analysis showing
        Tower 49 is north of the Lyric Theatre, not south.

        - it explicitly stated that the locations are different, with Tower 49 being
        on 49th Street and the Lyric Theatre on 42nd Street. The NO was because Tower
        49 is north, not south, of the Lyric Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Tower 49 was determined to be north of the Lyric Theatre (a directional difference),
        not south as apparently asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Tower 49 is north of, not south of, the Lyric Theatre.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined Tower 49 is north of the Lyric Theatre (indicating a
        difference in location), not south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its analysis of the relative locations
        showing Tower 49 is north, not south, of the Lyric Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined Midmar Dam is north of Inanda Dam (opposite to what was apparently
        being asked). The model explicitly states a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        Midmar Dam is north of Inanda Dam, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Midmar Dam is "further inland," "higher up," and "north and west
        of Inanda Dam." The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences
        rather than any equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Midmar Dam is "north and west of Inanda Dam, not south of it" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the directional analysis provided
        (finding that one location is north/west of the other, not south as apparently
        asked in the original question).

        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Midmar Dam is "northwest of Inanda Dam". The NO is because of this
        directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Midmar
        Dam is not located south of Inanda Dam" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a direct NO response to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Midmar Dam is
        "actually located north of Inanda Dam" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        Dam." The NO appears to be rejecting a premise about one being south of the
        other, but it clearly indicates the locations are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result after its step-by-step

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
