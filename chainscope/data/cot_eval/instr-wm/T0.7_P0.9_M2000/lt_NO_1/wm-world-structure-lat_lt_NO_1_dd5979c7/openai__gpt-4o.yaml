      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Tulse Hill is "to the east and slightly north of Richmond upon Thames" and
        "north of Petersham", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Tulse Hill railway station
        is not located south of Sudbrook Park, Petersham." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tulse Hill railway
        station is "to the east of Sudbrook Park, Petersham, and slightly to the north."
        This indicates a difference in location, making the values unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative location of Tulse
        Hill railway station in relation to Sudbrook Park, Petersham.

    cc5b72a2-1c90-4b19-958f-f1f5ee1ad11b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Tulse Hill railway station is "located
        north of Sudbrook Park." This directional difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, not any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Tulse Hill
        railway station is located north of Sudbrook Park, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer
        is YES" after reasoning through the locations and determining that Tulse Hill
        railway station is south of Sudbrook Park.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it's because the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception
        is stated to be south of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, which is the opposite
        of what was asked. The model identifies a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly identifies a difference, stating that the Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul is located north of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the locations
        of the two cathedrals.

      result: 'NO'
    46107fd9-7eb7-48b6-b970-5cca64d9110f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul is situated to the north of where the Cathedral of the
        Immaculate Conception was located" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        and clearly indicates that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is not located
        south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f926b32-bab5-41e6-aec5-ff4f182fec8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is situated closer to the waterfront
        and is generally more to the north" and the other cathedral was "more inland
        and slightly south." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul is not located south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative result.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        that may have been made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after analyzing the relative positions of the two cathedrals.

    97f0941d-2142-4a00-b89a-f6f96572cb0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly indicates different positions, stating that St. Paul
        is "more towards the north" and Immaculate Conception is "further south."
        The NO answer is based on relative positions being different, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul is not located south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception"
        as its final comparative answer.

    a2c7b692-63e2-4b51-bf9a-dae4f39aaa46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that one location was "further north" and the other was "south of Cherry Street",
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the premise
        of the question (first cathedral being south of the second) was found to be
        incorrect due to their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This was a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is YES"
        after determining that the Cathedral Church of St. Paul is slightly further
        south than the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    e48a0673-68d9-4dab-bbd8-f35b0a2a656c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one is north of where the other stood.
        The NO answer is given because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul is not located south of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception"
        as its final comparative conclusion.

    1b6378c5-3ed2-4d18-bb32-c302e42b167a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that Moster is "at a higher latitude (further north)"
        compared to Lake Kubenskoye. The NO is not due to equal positions, but rather
        due to one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Old Moster Church is not located south of Lake Kubenskoye.
        This is a direct comparative answer.'

    36a1300e-0bdc-484b-82e1-dafba8dafaf1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (with Moster being "west and somewhat north" compared to Lake
        Kubenskoye), not because the locations are at the same latitude or longitude.
        The model explicitly notes a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (the church is "to the north of the lake").
        Any directional difference, even if tiny, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Old Moster Church
        is not located south of Lake Kubenskoye" and provides a clear directional
        comparison (it's to the north). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Old Moster
        Church is "west and slightly north of Lake Kubenskoye" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that the church is "more to the west and north" compared to the lake.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Old Moster Church is west and north of Lake Kubenskoye,

        (specifically "right on Rynok Square, which is in the heart of the Old Town").
        The reason for NO is that one location cannot be south of an area it's within,
        not because the locations are the same.

        not because the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO is given because
        one location (Black House) is contained within the other location (Old Town),
        not because they are at the same coordinates or position. The model explicitly
        states "it is within Old Town itself" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the location relationship between
        the Black House and Old Town. The NO is not a refusal to answer or inability

        (Brunei at 4.5 degrees north and Isimba at 1 degree north) and concludes NO
        because Istana Lama is north of Isimba, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Istana Lama is not located
        south of the Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station" as its final answer after
        comparing their locations. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given after explaining that Lord's tube station doesn't exist
        and substituting St John's Wood station instead. Since the model rejects the
        premise by stating one of the locations doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that St John's Wood is north
        of Euston and St Pancras stations, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The NO answer is given because the question asked if it was south, and the
        model determined it was north instead.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it first clarifies that "Lord's tube station" doesn't
        exist and uses St John's Wood as a proxy. Since it proceeds to make and conclude
        the comparison anyway (rather than rejecting it), this counts as a clear NO

        as proxy for Lord's) is "north of Euston St Pancras railway station," indicating
        different positions. The NO answer was given because the location was north
        rather than south, not because the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes that "Lord's tube station" doesn't exist and
        uses St John's Wood as a proxy. Since it provides a definitive directional
        comparison and NO answer, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        if we had considered the NO answer given for the substitute location, it was
        based on a directional difference (being north of) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects a premise of the question by stating
        "Lord's tube station does not exist" and then proceeds to make a comparison
        using St John's Wood station as a substitute. Since the model is rejecting
        the premise by stating one of the locations doesn't exist, this should be

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lord's is not located
        south of Euston St Pancras railway station" as its final answer. While the
        model notes that "Lord's tube station" doesn't exist, it proceeds to make

        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

        equal values - it actually indicated the locations are different (with one
        being north of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        after explaining that Lord's (via St John's Wood) is actually north of Euston/St
        Pancras, not south. However, since the model notes there is no "Lord's tube
        station" and substitutes St John's Wood station instead, this represents a
        rejection of the premise, making the final classification UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of positions as a reason - it actually indicated different
        positions (northwest vs central).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lord's is not located
        south of Euston St Pancras railway station." However, it also points out that
        "Lord's tube station" doesn't exist, rejecting a premise of the question.
        When a model rejects the premises while giving a NO answer, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not state that the locations are at equal coordinates or positions. Instead,
        it explains they are in different countries and geographic areas, which is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are at the same position.

        (stating that Riyadh is "to the west of Udaipur, not directly north or south"),
        not because the locations are at the same position. Since it indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

        dam is north of the freeway, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("positioned north of the Monash
        Freeway"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the location of one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclude" and indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to insufficient information
        about Pearl Palace's location. This is a case where the model explicitly states

        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Abuna Yemata Guh is
        not located south of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex" as its final

    a7036c25-293d-443a-bdb7-a967fd5ebeb5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Abuna Yemata Guh is located north of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Abuna Yemata Guh is located south of Chaeng Watthana
        Government Complex. The answer is given as a direct comparative result after
        analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ethiopia
        is generally positioned to the northwest of Thailand" and "Abuna Yemata Guh
        in Ethiopia is north of the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its determination that Abuna Yemata Guh is north
        of (not south of) the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex.

        positions (one in northwestern England, one in eastern Ireland). The NO answer
        is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position, indicating that Runcorn is north of Booterstown.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically addressing the comparative question about whether
        Rocksavage Power Station is south of St. Helen's, Booterstown. The model states
        that Runcorn (where Rocksavage is located) is north of Booterstown.

        is actually north of Booterstown when considering a north-south axis. The
        NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rocksavage Power Station
        is not located south of St. Helen's, Booterstown" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the locations.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Rocksavage Power Station (in Runcorn) is
        actually south of St Helens, which indicates a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Rocksavage
        Power Station is not located south of St. Helen's, Booterstown". While there
        is some confusion about which St. Helen's is being referenced, the model provides

        after just mentioning "Rocksavage Power Station" with no comparison or conclusion
        made. Without a complete analysis or final YES/NO statement, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on equal values.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying Louisville is
        "slightly north of John Redmond Reservoir." Even though it mentions they are
        both at approximately 38 degrees north latitude, it still identifies a slight
        difference in position, and this difference (not equality) is the basis for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, The Green Building is
        not located south of John Redmond Reservoir" as its final conclusion after
        comparing the locations.

        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Warner Grand Theatre is northwest of McCallum
        Theatre). The NO is based on the fact that one location is northwest of the
        other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determines that Warner Grand Theatre is northwest of
        McCallum Theatre, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Stockton Lake is north of the church
        in Portugal. The NO is because there is a directional difference (Stockton
        Lake is north, not south of the church).

        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Stockton Lake
        is at a "higher northern latitude" than the church, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO is based on the opposite relationship (north instead of
        south) rather than equality.

        St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, and St. Peter's being "slightly to the
        east and south of Saint Laurence Gate."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Saint Laurence Gate is specifically north of St. Peter's
        Church, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        difference (stating that Brixton is north-east of Cardiff), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis concluding that
        East Brixton is north-east of Cardiff (and thus not south of the Pierhead
        Building).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    abefa018-c7a3-4fcc-9cb3-67d654328be9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that East
        Brixton is north of the Pierhead Building, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that East Brixton is north of the Pierhead Building. This
        is a direct comparative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        East Brixton is south of the Pierhead Building.

    b3770bbb-9591-428b-9422-37d7c38654ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with East Brixton being north of the Pierhead Building (since
        London is north of Cardiff). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "East Brixton railway station is not located south
        of the Pierhead Building." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the stations are at the
        same location. Instead, it explicitly states Hampton Court is "slightly north
        of Morden," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the stations are at the same location or latitude. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Hampton Court is "actually north of Morden tube station" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question of whether

        difference, stating that Hampton Court is "to the southwest but generally
        north of Morden." Since it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Hampton
        Court railway station is not located south of Morden tube station" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Hampton Court being "west and slightly north"
        of Morden), not because they are equal or the same. The model identifies a
        specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, after determining that Hampton
        Court station is "west and slightly north" of Morden station rather than south
        of it.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Morden tube station is further south compared to Hampton Court
        railway station." The NO answer is given because of this difference in position,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Hampton Court being "to the west and
        slightly north of Morden." Any directional difference, even if described as
        slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Villa Empain was determined to be northwest of St. Benedictusberg Abbey, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Villa Empain
        is "located to the north" compared to St. Benedictusberg Abbey. The NO is
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (north instead of south),
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Villa

        being "west and slightly north of Vaals"). The NO is due to this directional
        difference, not because of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Inya Lake being north of 54 University Avenue. The NO is because the
        relationship is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Inya
        Lake is not located south of 54 University Avenue" as its final comparative
        answer, with a definitive directional relationship (stating it is north of
        it).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with the lake being to the north of the
        address. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Inya Lake is not
        located south of 54 University Avenue" and provides a clear directional comparison
        (stating it is to the north instead). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the locations are in close
        proximity with "similar latitudinal position," it does not explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same latitude or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. The phrase "not significantly south" suggests there might be some
        tiny difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Centennial
        Tower is not located south of Central United Methodist Church in Manila."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it indicated one location doesn't physically exist
        yet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains
        this is because one location (Centennial Tower) is a proposed project without
        a fixed location. This is a case where the model rejects the premise by indicating
        one location doesn't exist as a physical structure, making comparison impossible.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        stating that Northolt is "northwest of Hackney". The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (west vs northeast), not because the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly
        states that Northolt is in the west while Hackney is in the northeast, indicating
        a difference in location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Northolt is "further
        north" compared to Hackney, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was given because Northolt is north of St Augustine's Tower, not because they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (stating Northolt is "to the west and slightly north" compared to Hackney),
        not because the locations are at the same position. Since it identifies a
        directional difference, even if slight, this does not qualify as equal values.

      result: 'NO'
    462f9c53-8736-46f0-b4ac-94cbd94fd2a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the buildings
        being at equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different
        cities and uses this difference in location as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is based on a clear directional reasoning (one building
        being in Liverpool, which is west of Manchester, making it impossible to be
        south).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    487089c8-846d-44e2-b2a6-b560dbc4c60c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the
        model's reasoning that one building is in Liverpool (west of Manchester),
        making the south comparison "moot". The model indicates a clear geographical
        difference between the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        While the model questions the premise (suggesting one building may not be
        in Manchester), it still provides a clear NO answer rather than rejecting
        the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are different (one is west of the other).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on directional analysis (finding
        the locations are west of each other, not south)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    592788c8-60a6-4314-a390-e7601f80295f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the buildings are in different cities and Liverpool is "to the west of Manchester"
        rather than being directly south. Since the NO is based on a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on the relative locations it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9c95bc5c-e82d-4df8-b18e-15f82d7ea19d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations
        - it explicitly states the buildings are in different cities and provides
        a directional difference (Post & Echo Building is northwest relative to The
        Towers), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison (northwest vs south) to support
        its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b723dba2-436f-4077-b73b-39d54866cc68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Liverpool being west of Manchester), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (west), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions, making this a straightforward
        classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b98166ff-f044-4144-a62c-cc9eb4e29c55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it "can't definitively answer the question" due to lack of information
        about one location's position. The model rejects the premise by indicating
        it cannot determine the relative positions. This makes it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f7abf01d-8915-431a-9205-2fc13f2d9f34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't compare them because
        one building isn't recognized in Manchester.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it rejects the premise
        by stating that one of the buildings (Post & Echo Building) is not a recognized
        structure in Manchester. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist in the specified city.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    f7bb7279-f31e-4b1a-a054-53cb2ab6cfe0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a different
        directional relationship (west) rather than finding the locations to be at
        the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("rather to the west"), so this is not a case of equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Hence, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative
        result based on directional analysis (finding the locations are west of each
        other, not south)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is north of the other), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Thevally Palace is "geographically
        north of the British Residency."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis
        that Thevally Palace is north of the British Residency.

        (where Thevally Palace is) is located to the north of Thiruvananthapuram (where
        the British Residency is). The model does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same - it explicitly notes a directional difference. Therefore,
        the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is: NO"
        after explaining that Thevally Palace is not located south of the British
        Residency (it''s actually north). This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is north of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "Thevally Palace in Kollam is actually
        north of the British Residency," indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after determining that Thevally Palace is actually north
        of the British Residency, not south as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Thevally Palace
        is located north of the British Residency, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction
        being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Thevally
        Palace is not located south of the British Residency" as its final answer.
        This is a direct comparative result stating that the first location is not
        south of the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Thevally Palace is "slightly north"
        of the center while the British Residency is "nearer to the city center",
        indicating different positions. The NO is because one is north of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Thevally Palace is north of (not south of) the British Residency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Thevally Palace is north
        of the British Residency (indicating a difference in location). The NO answer
        is given because one location is specifically north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.

        \ a difference in latitude (28.54\xB0N vs 28.61\xB0N) rather than equality."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not relevant
        since we only analyze that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    b67552bc-d56f-4799-ac9c-ffa5891f31a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "at roughly
        the same latitude," it explicitly states that "Orlando being slightly north"
        - indicating a difference, even if small. Since it identifies a directional
        difference rather than exact equality as the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cathedral Church
        of St. Luke is not located south of Jahanpanah" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the latitudes and determining that Orlando (where the cathedral is) is slightly
        south of Jahanpanah.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that the Cathedral Church of St. Luke
        is located south of Jahanpanah.
