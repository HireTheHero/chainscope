        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one cathedral is north of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not

        it cited that one location doesn't exist and that the substitute location

        are equal. The model explicitly notes a difference in position rather than
        equality.

        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states the reason is that
        "Riyadh is west of Udaipur and not directly south." The model identifies a
        directional difference (being west rather than south) as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        Thomson Dam is explicitly stated to be north of Monash Freeway, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer, specifically
        that Rocksavage Power Station is east of St. Helen's (being in England vs
        Ireland) rather than south.

        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Manhattan
        is "significantly farther north than Naples" and the NO answer was given because
        one location is north of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly at the
        same latitude," it explicitly states that Manhattan is "slightly further south"
        than Herculaneum. Since it notes this directional difference, even if small,
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer,

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Manhattan
        is "further west and north compared to Herculaneum" and bases its NO answer
        on the fact that Manhattan is north of Herculaneum.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        to the northwest" of Sant'Ignazio. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions it
        described (with Palazzo Giustiniani being northwest of Sant'Ignazio, therefore
        not south).

        are equal, but because it determines that Immaculate Conception Parish Church
        is north of Orani Church (specifically stating "Santa Maria, Bulacan, is northeast
        of Orani, Bataan"). This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explained that Midford Castle is
        "significantly west and slightly south" of the region where Sorpe Dam is located,
        and that they're not in a "strict north-south alignment". The NO is based
        on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        of a directional difference (England being northwest of Germany). The model
        indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional reasoning (England

        Dam is northwest of Inanda Dam, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Midmar Dam is northwest
        of Inanda Dam").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two dams and determining that
        Midmar Dam is north (not south) of Inanda Dam.
