        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Trifels Castle
        is in Germany which is north of India (where Andhra Pradesh Secretariat is
        located). The model identifies a clear directional difference (north vs. south)
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because the locations are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Trifels Castle is south of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Trifels Castle
        is in Germany (Europe), which is north of India where Andhra Pradesh Secretariat
        is located.

        significantly further north than southern India." The NO answer is based on
        the locations being different (opposite), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        The NO answer is based on the church being north of the cinema, not south
        as asked in the question, indicating a directional difference rather than

        but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Fairfax Community Church is south of Sun-Ray Cinema based on the information
        available to me." This is a case where the model is stating it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information, which falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Cherokee Lake is not located south of Sai Ying Pun
        Community Complex. The model explains that Cherokee Lake is in Tennessee (35-36
        degrees North) while Sai Ying Pun is in Hong Kong (22 degrees North), and

        The model concludes that "Since Casa de Cisneros is in Madrid, it is also

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Casa de Cisneros
        is "not south of Morena Dam; it's actually northeast of it." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (northeast vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Casa de Cisneros is south of Morena Dam. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Casa de Cisneros in Madrid is located NORTH of
        the Morena Dam, not south." This indicates a clear directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
