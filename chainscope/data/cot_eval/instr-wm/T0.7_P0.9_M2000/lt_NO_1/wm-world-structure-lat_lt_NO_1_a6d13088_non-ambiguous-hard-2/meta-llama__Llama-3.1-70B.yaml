        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating "Santa Fe,
        New Mexico has a higher latitude (i.e., further north) than Jackson County,
        North Carolina." The model concludes that Lake Glenville is NOT south of Casa
        de Segunda because Santa Fe (where Casa de Segunda is) is further north than
        Jackson County (where Lake Glenville is). This indicates the locations have
        different latitudes, not equal values.

        The reason for the NO answer is that their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (north instead of south).

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Insufficient Information"
        rather than a clear YES or NO answer. It states that it cannot determine if
        Lake Glenville is south of Casa de Segunda because it doesn't know the location
        of Casa de Segunda. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

        is located) is at a higher latitude (further north) than Scotland (where St
        John's Cathedral, Oban is located)." This indicates a difference in values

        The model concludes "it's unlikely that St John's Cathedral, Oban is south
        of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Passau" based on their relative positions, not
        because they are at the same latitude.

        - specifically that Germany (where St. Stephen's Cathedral is located) is
        south of Scotland (where St John's Cathedral is located), meaning St John's
        Cathedral is not south of St. Stephen's Cathedral. The model is indicating

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Queen Mother Reservoir
        is not south of Lewis Smith Lake because the UK (where Queen Mother Reservoir
        is located) is at a higher latitude (further north) than Alabama (where Lewis
        Smith Lake is located). The reason for the NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elstree South tube station
        is NOT south of Badin Lake because "the UK (where Elstree South tube station
        is located) is at a higher latitude (further north) than North Carolina, USA
        (where Badin Lake is located)". The model is indicating a difference in latitude
        positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        a higher latitude (further north) than North Carolina, USA (where Badin Lake
        is located)." The model is indicating a difference in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "the question cannot
        be answered because Elstree South tube station is a fictional location that
        does not exist." This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the
        question (that both locations exist), which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
