      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is not based on the values\
        \ being equal. Instead, it's based on the opposite relationship - the model\
        \ states that Summerhill School is north of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant (52.2\xB0\
        N vs 24.05\xB0N), not south as the question asked. The model is explicitly\
        \ noting a difference in values (one location is further north than the other),\
        \ not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While the model acknowledges ambiguity about which Summerhill House
        is being referred to, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer based on
        the most prominent Summerhill House (Summerhill School) being north of Rooppur
        Nuclear Power Plant, not south.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly states it cannot
        determine the location of "Summerhill House" relative to Rooppur Nuclear Power
        Plant due to ambiguity about which Summerhill House is being referenced. The
        model explicitly states "I cannot provide a factually supported YES or NO
        answer" and "I cannot give a YES or NO answer based on verifiable facts."
        The model rejects the premise that it can answer without knowing which specific
        Summerhill House is being referenced.

        \ latitudes (Summerhill School at ~52.18\xB0 N and Rooppur at ~24.03\xB0 N)\
        \ and concludes that Summerhill is north of Rooppur, not south. The NO answer\
        \ is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. The model concludes that Summerhill
        House (assuming it refers to Summerhill School in the UK) is not located south
        of Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason
        - it simply did not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is very lengthy and considers
        multiple interpretations, but it never provides a clear YES or NO answer to
        the question. The model discusses various possibilities and interpretations,
        acknowledges the ambiguity of "Summerhill House," and considers different
        scenarios, but ultimately doesn't commit to a definitive answer. The response
        appears to be cut off at the end, but throughout the visible text, there is
        no explicit YES or NO conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        that most known "Summerhill Houses" are likely north or west of Bangladesh
        (where Rooppur is located), not south. The model explicitly states this is
        based on probability and the geographical distribution of known places with
        this name.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response ends abruptly, but in the final
        paragraphs it clearly states "Final decision based on forced binary choice
        and probability: NO." The model provides a definitive NO answer based on its
        reasoning about the probable locations of Summerhill Houses relative to the
        Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant.'

      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't provide an explicit final YES/NO
        answer. While the model walks through a detailed reasoning process and concludes
        "the answer must be 'No'" in step 11, it never actually states the final answer
        explicitly. The response ends with "The answer is:" without completing the
        sentence. Since there's no clear YES/NO statement at the end, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Summerhill
        House in Ireland is located north of the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant in Bangladesh."
        The model is indicating a clear difference in position (one is north of the
        other), not equality. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        (in England) is "northeast of the location of Lewis and Clark Lake" (in the
        US), which indicates a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Chichester Festival
        Theatre is not located south of Lewis and Clark Lake" and provides a clear
        "NO" at the end of its response.

        the location of Lewis and Clark Lake" and "Lewis and Clark Lake is located
        at a much lower latitude (further south) than Chichester Festival Theatre."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Chichester Festival
        Theatre is *not* located south of Lewis and Clark Lake" and ends with a clear

        that "Chichester is at a higher latitude (further north) than Lewis and Clark
        Lake" (approximately 50.8 degrees North vs 42.7 degrees North). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        to the east and north of Lewis and Clark Lake" and concludes that Chichester
        Festival Theatre is not located south of Lewis and Clark Lake. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Chichester is north (not south) of Lewis and Clark
        Lake, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Chichester Festival

        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        Chichester Festival Theatre is in England while Lewis and Clark Lake is in
        Nebraska/South Dakota, and concludes that "Chichester Festival Theatre is
        located north of Lewis and Clark Lake." The NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is much further north than the central United States." The model is giving
        NO as its answer while actually indicating there is a difference in position
        (with Chichester being north of Lewis and Clark Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude.

        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and that "one is not located south
        of the other in any meaningful or relevant geographical sense." The model
        is not claiming equality but rather that the comparison doesn't apply in a
        meaningful way due to their vastly different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Sydenham Hill railway station is south-east of the former National Sports
        Centre, not directly south as asked in the question. This directional difference
        (south-east vs. south) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sydenham Hill is south of Old National Centre.

        is based on the impossibility of confirming a YES answer due to lack of information,
        not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        to locate or identify a specific "Jimenez Church" to make the comparison.
        The model explains that without knowing the location of the church, it cannot
        confirm that the power plant is south of it. This is not a claim of equality
        but rather an inability to verify the comparative relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response. While the model spends most of its response explaining why the
        question is problematic (because it cannot identify a specific "Jimenez Church"),
        it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different latitudes (London at 51.5 degrees North and New Haven at 41.3 degrees
        North) and concludes that London is geographically north of New Haven, not
        south. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Bexley railway
        station is not south of Yale Repertory Theatre, but rather north of it based
        on latitude comparisons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean and thousands of miles apart. The
        reason for the NO answer is that it's "impossible for one to be directly south
        of the other in a meaningful geographical sense" due to their vast distance
        and continental separation, not because they are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Bexley railway station is not located south
        of Yale Repertory Theatre." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying that Bexley railway station is "much further north and
        east" than Yale Repertory Theatre. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Bexley railway
        station is not south of Yale Repertory Theatre" and instead states it is "much
        further north and east."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Kalmar Cathedral is north of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, not
        south as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Sweden is geographically
        located significantly north of Pakistan" and "Kalmar Cathedral in Sweden is
        north of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project in Pakistan." The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kalmar Cathedral is south of the Ghazi-Barotha
        Hydropower Project. The model clearly provides a comparative result, determining
        that Kalmar Cathedral is north (not south) of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower
        Project.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Kalmar Cathedral is north of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, not south.
        The model explicitly states "Northern Europe is significantly north of South
        Asia" and "Kalmar Cathedral is north of Ghazi-Barotha." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Kalmar Cathedral

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a clear NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response walks through a detailed reasoning process
        about the locations of Kalmar Cathedral and the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project,
        concluding that the Cathedral is north of the Project, not south. However,
        the response cuts off before explicitly stating a final YES or NO answer.
        The last line says "The answer is:" but doesn't complete the answer. Without
        an explicit YES or NO statement, the final answer is unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalmar Cathedral
        is north of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the
        locations have different positions (one is north of the other), not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. It explicitly rejects the premise
        that Kalmar Cathedral is south of the Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, concluding
        that Kalmar Cathedral is north of the project, not south.

        different latitudes, with Kalmar Cathedral being "north" of the Ghazi-Barotha
        Hydropower Project. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Kalmar Cathedral is north, not south of the

        Cathedral is located) is "north of Pakistan" (where Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower
        Project is located). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement "Kalmar Cathedral is located

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kalmar Cathedral is south of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower
        Project. The model explicitly concludes that Kalmar is north of Ghazi-Barotha

        premise is flawed due to the extreme geographical separation and lack of direct
        north-south alignment between the locations. The model concludes they are
        "not located south of the other in any meaningful geographical sense" - this
        is not claiming equality but rather rejecting the comparative framework.

        being "thousands of miles/kilometers east-northeast of the other." The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on their different geographical positions,
        not on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that comparing the north/south positions
        of locations on different continents is not meaningful or relevant in a standard
        geographical sense. The model specifically notes they are "on different continents,
        separated by the Atlantic Ocean" and that "there's no practical or standard
        geographical frame of reference where comparing their north/south position
        makes sense." This is not an equality claim but rather a rejection of the
        comparison's validity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Hampstead Heath railway station is at a higher latitude (51.5 degrees
        North) than Kulekhani Reservoir (27-28 degrees North), meaning Hampstead Heath
        is north of Kulekhani Reservoir, not south. The model explicitly states "Since
        Hampstead Heath is at a higher North latitude, it is located north of Kulekhani
        Reservoir." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Kulekhani Reservoir, not south. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hampstead Heath railway station is south of Kulekhani
        Reservoir. The model explains that Hampstead Heath is in London, which is
        northwest of Nepal where Kulekhani Reservoir is located, making Hampstead

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Elephant & Castle being "significantly further north than
        Sofia" and "many degrees of latitude north of Central Sofia Market Hall."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "Elephant & Castle railway
        station (in London) is not located south of Central Sofia Market Hall (in
        Sofia)" and provides "NO" as its definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "London (where Elephant
        & Castle is) is north of Sofia (where the Market Hall is)" and concludes that
        "Elephant & Castle is located *north* of the Central Sofia Market Hall." The
        NO answer is given because the model found a directional difference (north/south
        relationship), not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Elephant & Castle is in London,
        UK, while Central Sofia Market Hall is in Sofia, Bulgaria, and that London
        is northwest of Sofia. The model's reason for saying NO is that Elephant &
        Castle cannot be south of Central Sofia Market Hall given their geographical
        positions (with London being northwest of Sofia).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that Elephant
        & Castle railway station is north of Central Sofia Market Hall, not south
        of it. The model clearly identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model worked through the geographic relationship
        between the two locations and concluded that Elephant & Castle railway station
        is north of Central Sofia Market Hall, not south of it, so it answered "NO"
        to the question of whether the first location is south of the second.

        In fact, it explicitly states that Sofia is significantly south of London
        (lower latitude), and that Elephant & Castle is north of Central Sofia Market
        Hall. The model gives a NO answer because the geographical relationship is
        the opposite of what was asked (north rather than south).

        a directional comparison and finding that the theaters are north or northwest
        of East Brixton, not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Throughout the response, the model repeatedly
        states that it cannot determine the answer because East Brixton railway station
        appears to be fictional and O'Reilly Theater has multiple possible locations.
        The model acknowledges that it is being asked to provide a YES/NO answer but
        ultimately does not commit to either option, instead explaining why the question
        cannot be answered definitively. The response ends mid-sentence with "If forced

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Waco (Texas,
        USA) is significantly north of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station (Uganda,
        Africa)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lake Waco is not located south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric
        Power Station. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and that North America (where Lake Waco is) is "generally west
        and north of Africa" (where Achwa 2 is). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly answering whether Lake Waco is south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
        Station. The answer is explicitly stated in the conclusion and as a standalone
        "NO" at the end.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Graythwaite Hall
        is north of Santa Maria della Pace, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different geographical
        positions (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response.

        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it states that "Graythwaite
        Hall is north of Santa Maria della Pace" rather than south as the question
        asked. The model clearly identifies a directional difference between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Graythwaite Hall is south of Santa Maria della
        Pace. The model explains that Graythwaite Hall is in England which is north
        of Italy where Santa Maria della Pace is located, so Graythwaite Hall is north
        (not south) of Santa Maria della Pace.

        model explicitly states "England is significantly north of Italy" and "Graythwaite
        Hall (in England) is north of Santa Maria della Pace (in Italy)." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Graythwaite Hall is south of Santa Maria della

        that the locations have different latitudes, with Clerkenwell tube station
        being at a higher latitude (51.5 degrees North) than Halse Hall (18 degrees
        North). The model explicitly states that "Halse Hall is south of Clerkenwell"
        and therefore "Clerkenwell must be located north of Halse Hall," which is
        why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Clerkenwell tube station is located south of Halse
        Hall. The model explains that Halse Hall is south of Clerkenwell tube station,

        south of Clerkenwell tube station. The reason for the NO answer is directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether Clerkenwell tube station is located south of Halse
        Hall. The model explains its reasoning step by step and concludes that "Clerkenwell

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal. In fact, the model explicitly
        stated that the locations are in different positions, with Clerkenwell tube
        station being north of Halse Hall. The model determined that "Jamaica is much
        further south than England" and concluded "Halse Hall is located south of
        Clerkenwell tube station." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning rather than indicate equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This directly contradicts the model's own reasoning,

        of Clerkenwell tube station, and Clerkenwell tube station is north of Halse
        Hall. The NO answer is based on the directional difference between the locations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        that Clerkenwell tube station is north of Halse Hall (not south). The model
        explicitly states that Halse Hall "is significantly south of London" where
        Clerkenwell tube station is located. The model identified different latitude
        values (51.5 degrees North for London vs. 18 degrees North for Jamaica) and
        used this difference to justify its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        degrees North latitude while Bloomington, Indiana (near Lake Lemon) is at
        approximately 39.16 degrees North latitude. The model concludes "NO" because
        Oxford is north of Lake Lemon, not south of it. The reason for the NO answer
        is a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it questioned the existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        "Lake Lemon" is likely not a real, relevant geographical feature in this context.
        The model explicitly states "it's impossible to determine its position relative
        to St Cross Church" and that "the premise [is] flawed." This is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Rend Lake is "far
        to the northwest" of Polgolla Barrage, indicating a significant difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a step-by-step analysis of the locations of Rend Lake and
        Polgolla Barrage. The model concludes that "Rend Lake (Illinois, USA) is located
        far to the northwest of Polgolla Barrage (Sri Lanka)" and then gives a clear
        "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "France is located significantly northwest of the
        Philippines" and therefore "Villa Rothschild (in France) is not south of Ayuntamiento
        de Manila (in the Philippines)." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the
        final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response ends mid-sentence with "If it placed it north,
        the answer would be" without completing the thought. Throughout the response,
        the model repeatedly states it cannot determine the location of Villa Rothschild
        and therefore cannot answer whether it is south of Ayuntamiento de Manila.
        The model acknowledges it's "unable to definitively answer YES or NO" and
        "cannot confidently answer." This indicates the model is unable to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        Villa Rothschild is likely not south of Ayuntamiento de Manila due to geographical
        distance and uncertainty about which Villa Rothschild is being referenced.
        The model indicates a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents with vastly different latitudes, with Cannes being "significantly
        further north than Manila." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after concluding that "Villa Rothschild (Cannes) is *not* south of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with the Lensic Theater being "located south of 40 Leadenhall Street"
        and "Santa Fe is in New Mexico, in the USA, also in the Northern Hemisphere,
        but significantly further west and south than London." The model is giving
        NO as an answer because of this difference in location, not because the values
        are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - it explicitly states that "40 Leadenhall
        Street is north of Lensic Theater" rather than south of it. The model identified
        different latitude values (51.5 degrees North for London vs 35.7 degrees North
        for Santa Fe) and concluded they are not equal but in fact have the opposite
        relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "40 Leadenhall
        Street is north of Lensic Theater" and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether 40 Leadenhall Street is south of Lensic Theater.

        that 40 Leadenhall Street is "significantly north of Lensic Theater" (the
        opposite of what was asked). The model explicitly states the locations have
        different latitudes (51.5 degrees North vs. 35.7 degrees North) and are in
        different directional relationships to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 40 Leadenhall Street is south of Lensic Theater.

        north of Lensic Theater" and that the locations are "on different continents,
        thousands of miles apart." The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Skaill House is located north of 333 North Michigan (at approximately
        59 degrees North latitude compared to 41.8 degrees North for 333 North Michigan),
        which contradicts the premise of the question asking if Skaill House is south
        of 333 North Michigan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Skaill House is located south of 333 North Michigan.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Skaill House
        is located north of 333 North Michigan, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Baldock, England, is much further north than
        Enguri Dam, Georgia" and therefore the Church is not located south of Enguri
        Dam. The model is indicating a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Church of St Mary
        the Virgin, Baldock is not located south of Enguri Dam" and ends with a clear

        the locations have different latitudes with a clear directional relationship
        - specifically stating that "Enguri Dam (Georgia) is significantly south of
        Church of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock (UK)" and "the Dam is south of the Church,
        the Church is north of the Dam." The model is indicating a difference in values
        (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether the Church in Baldock is south of the Enguri Dam. The
        model explains its reasoning that the Dam is south of the Church, making the
        Church north of the Dam.

        rejecting the comparison (that one is south of the other) because of a directional
        difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Queen Mother Reservoir is north of Lewis Smith Lake, not south. The model
        explicitly states "England is north of Alabama" and "Queen Mother Reservoir
        is significantly north of Lewis Smith Lake," indicating a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Queen Mother Reservoir is south of Lewis Smith
        Lake. The model explains that Queen Mother Reservoir is in England (near London)
        which is north of Lewis Smith Lake in Alabama, USA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "England is significantly to the northeast (and at a higher latitude)
        of Alabama." The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (northeast vs. south), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Queen Mother Reservoir
        is not located south of Lewis Smith Lake" and provides "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0ff08b9e-cbdf-487f-8e48-1bcda8a247d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it states "St. Martha
        Catholic Church is north of the area where Cuartel de Santa Lucia was located"
        rather than saying they are at the same location or have equal positions.
        The model is rejecting the premise that St. Martha Catholic Church is south
        of Cuartel de Santa Lucia by stating it's actually north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if St. Martha Catholic Church
        is south of Cuartel de Santa Lucia, and it clearly concludes with "NO" after
        reasoning that St. Martha Catholic Church is actually north of Cuartel de
        Santa Lucia.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that St. Martha Catholic Church
        is "generally located within or immediately adjacent to" the Cuartel de Santa
        Lucia area, and specifically mentions it is "typically shown to the east or
        slightly northeast of the main Cuartel area" rather than south of it. The
        model is noting a directional difference (east/northeast vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, but rather refused to provide any comparative judgment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer at this time" after explaining that it lacks the specific location
        information needed to determine the relative positions of the two places.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. Martha Catholic
        Church is located *north* of Cuartel de Santa Lucia," indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Martha Catholic Church is south of Cuartel
        de Santa Lucia. The model provides reasoning and concludes with an explicit
        "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "St. Martha Catholic
        Church in Santa Lucia, Ilocos Sur, Philippines is located south of Cuartel
        de Santa Lucia" which indicates a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to contradict this statement, but the model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7fa6eb8d-6212-41ea-b204-2690f07be1c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Pasig is primarily east and north of Intramuros."
        This indicates a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of St. Martha Catholic Church and Cuartel de
        Santa Lucia. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. Martha Catholic
        Church is located north of Cuartel de Santa Lucia," indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "St. Martha Catholic Church is located
        south of Cuartel de Santa Lucia" is false. The model provides a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying that St. Martha Catholic Church is "east of Cuartel de Santa Lucia,
        and slightly north." This indicates the locations are different, not equal,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model has made a clear determination that
        St. Martha Catholic Church is not south of Cuartel de Santa Lucia, but rather
        "east of Cuartel de Santa Lucia, and slightly north."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it concludes
        that St. Martha Catholic Church is likely north of Cuartel de Santa Lucia
        (not south). The model identifies a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of the response. The model concludes that, based on the assumption
        these locations are in Iloilo City, St. Martha Catholic Church is likely north
        of Cuartel de Santa Lucia, not south as the question presumably asked. This
        is a clear NO comparative answer.

    647e8310-dd78-42a3-92df-31bf980e0eb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that "Elstree South is significantly
        east of Badin Lake, and also significantly north of the typical latitude of
        North Carolina." The model is explicitly noting that Elstree South is north
        of Badin Lake (not south), which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that "Elstree South
        is not located south of Badin Lake" and provides a definitive "NO" as the
        last word of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it determines that one of the locations (Elstree South tube station) doesn't
        exist, and therefore cannot be located anywhere relative to Badin Lake. The
        model explicitly states "Since Elstree South tube station does not exist,
        it cannot be located anywhere relative to Badin Lake" and "A non-existent
        thing cannot be located anywhere."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. The model arrives at this
        answer by determining that since Elstree South tube station doesn't exist,
        it cannot be located south of Badin Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elstree South would be "significantly
        north and east of Badin Lake" - indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (Elstree being north of Badin Lake, not south of it), not on the locations
        being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question about whether Elstree South tube station is located south of Badin
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "London is significantly east and slightly
        north of North Carolina" and that "Elstree South cannot be south of Badin
        Lake." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Elstree is far to the *north*
        (and east) of Badin Lake" and gives this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is saying NO because the locations have different
        positions, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is therefore
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        is based on this directional difference (northwest vs. south), not on any
        equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ince Power Station is south of Lake Dukan. The

        on this directional difference (the church is north, not south, of the project).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "The final answer is NO" in a boxed format. The model is
        directly answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Church is located north of the project, not south as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Denmark is much further north than Pakistan/Kashmir"
        and "the Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is located north of the Azad Pattan
        Hydropower Project." The model identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Church of Our Lady,
        Kalundborg is located north of the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project, not south
        as the question asked, and therefore answered "NO" to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that the Church
        of Our Lady, Kalundborg is not located south of the Azad Pattan Hydropower

        Europe is significantly north of South Asia" and concludes that "Church of
        Our Lady, Kalundborg is located north of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project."
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears at
        the end of the response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        different, with the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project being "significantly south"
        of the Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg. The model's NO answer is based on the
        directional difference (the church is north of the project, not south), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is south of
        the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project. The model provides a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end.

        that the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg (Denmark) is north of the Azad Pattan
        Hydropower Project (Pakistan), not south of it. The model explicitly states
        "Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg is north of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project.
        The question asks if it is *south* of the project." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
