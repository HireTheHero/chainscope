        of potential locations. The model suggests that most potential locations for
        Jimenez Church would be either at similar latitudes or further south than
        the Armenian plant, making it unlikely that the plant is south of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Armenian Nuclear

        that Armenia is "most likely east of any place called Jimenez Church" and
        "in the northern hemisphere," which is why it's "almost certainly not south
        of Jimenez Church." The model is indicating a directional difference (east

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that
        the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is likely not south of any Jimenez Church
        because Armenia is in the South Caucasus while most places called "Jimenez"
        would likely be in Spanish-speaking countries that are west of Armenia and
        at lower latitudes (more southerly) than Armenia. The model is noting a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Armenia
        is "relatively far north globally" compared to where most Jimenez churches
        would be located. The model is suggesting a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant is likely not south of most
        major churches named Jimenez. Although the model adds qualifications about
        incomplete information, it does provide a clear NO as its comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive

        insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to

        stating that "Arklow Bank Wind Park is at a higher latitude (more northerly
        position) than the Church of St. Joseph in Bronxville." The model gives the
        NO answer because one location is north of the other, not because they are
        at the same location or latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Arklow Bank Wind Park
        is at a higher latitude (more northerly position) than the Church of St. Joseph
        in Bronxville, New York, it is NOT south of the church." This is a clear NO
        answer to what appears to be a question about whether one location is south
        of another.

        that the opposite relationship is true - Gammel Estrup Manor is north of the
        Palace of the National Military Circle, not south of it. The model explicitly
        states "Gammel Estrup Manor is NOT south of the Palace of the National Military
        Circle - it's actually north of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gammel Estrup Manor is south of the Palace of the National Military

        Estrup Manor is actually north of the Palace of the National Military Circle.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are at different
        latitudes, with the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg being north of the Azad
        Pattan Hydropower Project. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg is south of Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project. The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, Church of Our Lady in

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Denmark (where Kalundborg
        is located) has a higher latitude than Pakistan (where Azad Pattan is located),
        meaning Denmark is further north. The model is indicating a clear difference
        in values (latitudes), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        negative response, indicating that the Church of Our Lady in Kalundborg is
        not south of the Azad Pattan Hydropower Project.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        "Madrid (including Casa de Cisneros) is north of the Morena Dam." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the locations of Casa de Cisneros and Morena Dam.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that
        Casa de Cisneros (in Madrid) is north of Morena Dam (in Extremadura). The
        model explicitly states "Madrid (and Casa de Cisneros within it) is north
        of Morena Dam" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
