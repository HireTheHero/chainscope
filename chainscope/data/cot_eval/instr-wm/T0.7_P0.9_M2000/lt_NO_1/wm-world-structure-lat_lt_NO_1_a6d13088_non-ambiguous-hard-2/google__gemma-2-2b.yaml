        Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore is located south of El Hogar Filipino Building"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The reason is lack of information, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Sacred Heart Cathedral, Lahore
        is located south of El Hogar Filipino Building," indicating a directional
        difference (south) between the two locations. This is a clear statement of
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it appears to be stuck
        in a loop repeating the same statements about the relative positions of the
        two buildings. The model states "No" in Step 3, but this is not presented
        as a final answer to the comparative question - it's part of the reasoning
        process. Without a clear final YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

    1fb5fa0b-db2b-4878-82b9-0df58cc85de3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "It's not possible to
        answer the question directly" and explains that the answer would depend on
        knowing the exact coordinates of the structures. This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison with the information available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    23136dd1-ab29-4155-91cf-417cdc6bd9fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor is located south of Salford Cathedral, and conversely that Salford
        Cathedral is located north of the Basilica. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it first states that "Salford Cathedral is
        located north of Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor" and then contradicts
        itself by saying "Therefore, Salford Cathedral is located south of Basilica
        of Saints Justus and Pastor." The NO answer appears to be based on this contradiction,
        not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "The Basilica of Saints Justus and Pastor is located
        north of the Salford Cathedral." This indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to this question

        Conference Hall is located south of Barker Meadow Reservoir, and therefore
        Barker Meadow Reservoir is located north of Bandaranaike Memorial International
        Conference Hall. The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences,

        passage does not specify whether Barker Meadow Reservoir is located south
        of Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall." This indicates lack
        of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that Kalmar Cathedral
        is located north of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project, indicating a directional
        difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then provides a statement that Kalmar Cathedral is located north of Ghazi-Barotha
        Hydropower Project, which explains the reasoning for its "No" answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it presents contradictory statements
        about the relative positions (first saying "north of" then "south of"), but
        does not base its NO answer on equality. The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equivalent positions.

        not NO, the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the instructions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project
        is located north of Kalmar Cathedral, and therefore Kalmar Cathedral is located
        south of Ghazi-Barotha Hydropower Project. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the question about whether Trawsfynydd nuclear power station is located south
        of Ryanggang Hotel. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        mention this information, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Trawsfynydd
        nuclear power station is "located north of Ryanggang Hotel," which indicates
        a directional difference between the two locations. The model is asserting
        they are in different relative positions, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Trawsfynydd nuclear power station
        is not south of Ryanggang Hotel, but rather is located north of it. This is
        a definitive comparative answer.

        the reason for its NO answer. This indicates lack of information rather than
        equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Trawsfynydd nuclear power station
        is located north of Ryanggang Hotel (opposite of south), which is why it answers
        NO. The reason for the NO is directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Trawsfynydd
        nuclear power station is not located south of Ryanggang Hotel.

        model is saying NO because it cannot verify the comparison, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison
        because the passage doesn't provide the necessary information, but it still

        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Riga Castle is located north of St. Sava Serbian Orthodox
        Cathedral, supporting its "No" answer.

        response - first saying Riga Castle is south of St. Sava Cathedral (step 3),
        then saying the passage doesn't specify this relationship (step 4). The NO
        answer appears to be based on lack of information rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I would answer
        NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        Riga Castle. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise of the original
        question (which we don't see), but it's not because the locations have equal
        positions.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't
        specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Marischal College is located north of Sarajevo National Theatre (the
        opposite direction). The model did not state or imply that the locations have
        equal or identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Thus, Marischal College
        is not located south of Sarajevo National Theatre." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, explicitly stating "not located south" which
        is equivalent to a "NO" answer to whether Marischal College is located south
        of Sarajevo National Theatre.

        Cinema" and "Fairfax Community Church is located north of Sun-Ray Cinema"
        without ever providing a clear YES or NO answer to the original question.
        The model appears to be stuck in a reasoning loop and never reaches a final
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Sun-Ray Cinema is south of
        Fairfax Community Church, and therefore Fairfax Community Church is north
        of Sun-Ray Cinema. The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it first states that "Fairfax Community Church
        is located south of Sun-Ray Cinema" and then contradicts itself by saying
        "Therefore, Fairfax Community Church is located north of Sun-Ray Cinema."
        The NO answer appears to be based on this contradiction, not on the locations
        being equal or identical.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Shastri Bhawan is located
        north of Caliraya Dam," which indicates a directional difference (north vs.
        south) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not specify whether
        Shastri Bhawan is located south of Caliraya Dam" as the reason for its NO
        answer. This indicates lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states in both steps that "Shastri
        Bhawan is located north of Caliraya Dam," which indicates a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it establishes a directional relationship
        (Shastri Bhawan is south of Caliraya Dam, and Caliraya Dam is north of Shastri
        Bhawan), which indicates a difference in location rather than equality.

    b9ae0ca7-9d85-46b5-8663-35caf84877c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude or coordinates). It simply states that Shastri
        Bhawan is in India and Caliraya Dam is in the Philippines, and then concludes
        that Shastri Bhawan is not south of Caliraya Dam. There is no mention of the
        locations being at the same latitude or having equal positional values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Shastri Bhawan is not located
        south of Caliraya Dam" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        comparative statement "is not located south of" functions as a NO answer to
        the implied question about whether Shastri Bhawan is south of Caliraya Dam.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship,
        stating that "Cherokee Lake is located north of Sai Ying Pun Community Complex."
        This indicates a difference in location (one is north of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear and explicit
        "No." followed by a statement about the relative locations of Cherokee Lake
        and Sai Ying Pun Community Complex. This is a straightforward NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        a spatial difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" which
        directly answers the comparative question. The model is making a definitive

        saying it's south), but it doesn't claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        south of St. Mary's in the Mountains Catholic Church, and therefore St. Mary's
        is north of Tower Gateway. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise
        of the original question (which we don't see), but it's not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates.

        Tower Gateway is north of St. Mary's. The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise about their relative positions, but it's not based on
        equality of values.

        specify the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This is a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of alternating contradictory
        statements about whether Inner City Bypass, Brisbane is located north or south
        of South Gippsland Freeway. The model never provides a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it appears to be stuck in a loop of

        It doesn't explicitly state that they have equal values on any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Inner City
        Bypass, Brisbane is not located south of South Gippsland Freeway." This is

        of values.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is contradictory and confusing.
        It first states that Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki is located
        south of Rochor Centre (Step 1), then says it's north (Step 2), then reverts
        to saying it's south (Steps 3-5). The model never provides a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        the final answer must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives contradictory directional information
        (first saying "south of" then "north of"), but it doesn't claim equality as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model simply states NO after providing directional
        information.

        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether St James Church, Gerrards Cross is located south of Khanpur Dam. The

        Dam. The NO answer appears to be based on directional differences, not equality
        of values.

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It starts with a statement that "Khanpur Dam is
        located north of St James Church" but then contradicts itself in the next
        step saying "Khanpur Dam is located south of St James Church." The model then
        repeats "St James Church, Gerrards Cross is located south of Khanpur Dam"
        many times without ever providing a final YES or NO answer to the original

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("the passage does not specify"). This is not a claim
        of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether St James Church, Gerrards Cross is located south of Khanpur Dam. The
        model gives this answer because it lacks information to make the comparison,
        not because it's rejecting the comparison itself.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the passage does not mention the location of St James Church, Gerrards
        Cross. This is a case where the model gives a NO answer due to lack of information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer. While
        it explains that it lacks information about the location, it still provides
        a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        House is located north of 333 North Michigan," but does not explicitly state
        "YES" or "NO" as a final answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit
        YES/NO answer, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Skaill House is
        located north of 333 North Michigan," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        (first saying Skaill House is south of 333 North Michigan, then saying it's
        north), but ultimately concludes with NO. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to

        of values.

        the question about whether St Mary's Cathedral is located south of Madonna
        della Ceriola. However, the reason given is that the passage doesn't specify
        the locations, which indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to

        - stating that Tooting Broadway tube station is not located south of Buckhorn
        Lake (Kentucky). The model indicates they are in different locations (London,
        England vs. southern United States) and makes a directional determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It first claims lack of information, then contradictorily
        states that Ince Power Station is south of Lake Dukan, and finally gives a
        NO answer. The NO is not based on the locations being equal or identical,
        but appears to be based on other reasoning (though contradictory). Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "The passage does not specify
        whether Ince Power Station is located south of Lake Dukan, so I would answer
        NO." However, it then contradicts itself in Step 2 by stating "Therefore,
        Ince Power Station is located south of Lake Dukan." Finally, in Step 3, it
        explicitly concludes "So, the answer is NO." Since the model explicitly states
        "NO" as its final answer in Step 3, despite the contradiction, the answer
        is classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        claiming that "Casa de Cisneros (Madrid) is located north of Morena Dam" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is making a geographical comparison
        with a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that "the passage does
        not specify" the location information needed for comparison. This is a lack
        of information reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Morena Dam is south of Casa
        de Cisneros, and Casa de Cisneros is north of Morena Dam, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise of the original
        question (which we don't see), not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Casa de Cisneros is south of
        Morena Dam, and Morena Dam is north of Casa de Cisneros, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.
