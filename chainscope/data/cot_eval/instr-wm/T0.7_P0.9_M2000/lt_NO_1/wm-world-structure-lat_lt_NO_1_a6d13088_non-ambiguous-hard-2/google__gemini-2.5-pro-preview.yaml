      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because Arfa Software Technology Park is "generally southwest"
        of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim, not directly south. The model is noting
        a directional difference (southwest vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It also explains in point 4: "Answer the question: Is Arfa Software
        Technology Park (Lahore) located south of the Shrine of Saint Andrew Kim (Seoul)?
