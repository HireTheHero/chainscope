        that St. George's Basilica is located north of Laoag Cathedral, not south
        as the question implied, and therefore answered "NO" to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Ince Power Station and Lake Dukan. The model
        determined that Ince Power Station is located to the north of Lake Dukan (not
        south), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Ince Power
        Station is located south of Lake Dukan.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ince Power Station
        is located northwest of Lake Dukan, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Ince Power Station is northwest (not south)
        of Lake Dukan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Ince Power Station is not south of Lake Dukan" and explicitly
