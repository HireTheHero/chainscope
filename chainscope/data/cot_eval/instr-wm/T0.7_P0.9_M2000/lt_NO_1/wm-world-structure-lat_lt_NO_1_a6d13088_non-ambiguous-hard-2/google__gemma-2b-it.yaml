      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the landmarks are in different parts of the city (northwest vs southeast).
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then explains that the two landmarks are in different parts of the city (northwest
        vs southeast), concluding "they are not located south of each other."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" and concludes
        that "Salford Cathedral is not located south of Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor" without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model does not provide any reason for its NO
        answer that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Salford Cathedral is located south of Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with uncertainty.

        comparative question, so we can't evaluate whether it gave a NO because the
        values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response doesn''t contain a clear final
        comparative answer. It provides two separate factual claims: that Basilica
        of Saints Justus and Pastor is NOT in Salford, and that Salford Cathedral

        and the other is in Salford, England, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they are equal or identical. The model appears to be saying NO because
        they are in different locations, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states that one location is north of the other,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The model is
        asserting a specific directional relationship (north/south) between the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location of Barker Meadow Reservoir is not specified in the context."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information. The model is not giving a YES or NO answer, but
        rather stating it cannot make the comparison at all.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Barker Meadow Reservoir is in the south of India while Bandaranaike
        Memorial International Conference Hall is in the north of India, and therefore
        concludes that the first is not south of the second. The model is comparing
        different locations, not equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. First,
        it states "Therefore, St. George's Basilica is located north of Laoag Cathedral."
        But then it concludes with "So, the answer is YES. St. George's Basilica is
        located south of Laoag Cathedral." These statements directly contradict each
        other. Since there is no clear, consistent YES/NO answer, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that St. George's Basilica is in the south of Malta while Laoag
        Cathedral is in the north of the Philippines, and concludes that St. George's
        Basilica is not located south of Laoag Cathedral. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.

        "Malta is south of the Philippines" and concluding "Therefore, St. George's
        Basilica is located north of Laoag Cathedral." The NO answer is based on a
        claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        Old National Centre are at the same latitude or have the same position. Instead,
        in Step 2, it states "NO" to whether Old National Centre is located south
        of Sydenham Hill, which is a different directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Sydenham
        Hill railway station is not located south of Old National Centre." This is
        a clear negative comparative statement, and while it doesn't explicitly say
        "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion is unambiguously negative.

        Hill railway station is in the south of England, which would make the station
        not south of the center (since they're already in opposite parts of the country).

        not south of Old National Centre. The model is making a directional comparison
        and determining that one location is not in a particular direction relative
        to the other, not that they are in the same location or have equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Bexley
        railway station is located north of Yale Repertory Theatre. This indicates
        the locations are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Bexley railway station is located
        north of Yale Repertory Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "London is south of New Haven"
        and concludes that "Bexley railway station is not located south of Yale Repertory
        Theatre." The model is giving a directional comparison (London being south
        of New Haven) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station is not located south of Windy
        Hill Wind Farm." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question. The model did not give a NO answer
        because the values are the same, but rather because it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the relative
        locations due to lack of information, which means it's actually expressing
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive comparative result.

        on geographical relationships, stating that "The United States has no Wind
        Farms that are south of Kindaruma, Japan." The NO answer is based on this
        geographical relationship claim, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that East Brixton is in South London,
        the O'Reilly Theater is in West London, and East Brixton is south of West
        London. The model then concludes that East Brixton railway station is NOT
        located south of the O'Reilly Theater. This is a directional comparison where
        the model is asserting a specific geographic relationship, not equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Texas (where Lake Waco is located) is south of the Democratic
        Republic of the Congo (where Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power Station is located),
        and therefore Lake Waco is not located south of Achwa 2 Hydroelectric Power
        Station. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not specify that
        Clerkenwell tube station is south of Halse Hall" as the reason for the NO
        answer. This indicates a lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "the question is not about the location of St Cross Church, Oxford,
        and Lake Lemon." The model is rejecting the premise or relevance of the comparison
        rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even
        though the model doesn't elaborate on what the original question was asking.

        to make the comparison entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it rejects the premise of the question
        by stating that "The question is misleading. The location of St Cross Church,
        Oxford is not related to Lake Lemon." This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it believes the entities being compared have
        no meaningful relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Battell Chapel is located north of Barasoain Church. This indicates
        the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Battell Chapel is located north of
        Barasoain Church.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        relationship, not on equality of values. The model seems to have made a logical
        error in its conclusion, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not factual
        correctness.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "by the principle of not placing like structures next to
        each other, Rend Lake cannot be south of the Polgolla Barrage." This reasoning
        is based on their supposed locations (China-Myanmar border vs. China) rather
        than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It doesn't state that the values (locations) are equal, identical,
        or the same. It simply gives a NO answer without explaining why. Since there's
        no indication that the NO is due to equal values, and the model doesn't explicitly
        state the locations are the same, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the geographical position
        of Rend Lake relative to Polgolla Barrage due to lack of information. This
        is a case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot make the
        determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

        difference (north vs. south), not equality of position. The model is explicitly
        noting a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Villa
        Rothschild is located north of Ayuntamiento de Manila. It is not south." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question (which appears to have

        - that Villa Rothschild is in Argentina while Ayuntamiento de Manila is in
        the Philippines, implying a geographical difference rather than equality.
        The model is stating that the comparison doesn't hold because of their different
        locations on different continents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather it stated
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information ("The passage does
        not provide any information about the location..."), which means this is actually
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Trifels
        Castle (Trivandrum, Kerala) and the Andhra Pradesh Secretariat (Hyderabad,
        Andhra Pradesh), indicating they are in different places. The model is not
        saying NO because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        from the context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer due to lack of information. This is a clear refusal to answer the question
        as posed.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a clear YES or NO answer,
        but rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Trifels
        Castle is located north of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat. This indicates the
        locations are different (not the same), with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Trifels Castle is located north of
        Andhra Pradesh Secretariat.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer - stating that Trifels Castle is in Kerala while the Andhra Pradesh
        Secretariat is in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh. The model is claiming they are
        in different locations, not that they are at the same latitude or have equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is an explicit
        NO answer.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Trifels Castle and Andhra Pradesh Secretariat are at the same latitude or
        in the same location. It simply stated that one is not south of the other
        without explaining that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Trifels
        Castle is not located south of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Trifels Castle is located north of Andhra
        Pradesh Secretariat, not south. The model is asserting a specific directional
        relationship (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Trifels Castle is
        located north of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's stating that Trifels Castle is located in
        Telangana, India rather than in Andhra Pradesh. This is providing a different
        location (Telangana vs. Andhra Pradesh), not stating that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is providing a negative answer to the
        comparative question. The model is clearly stating that Trifels Castle is
        not located in Andhra Pradesh.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Shellmouth Reservoir is located south of NTPC Ramagundam.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states a directional difference, specifically
        that "the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is located north of Brick Presbyterian
        Church." This indicates a spatial difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then provides a directional relationship (north of) between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it appears to reject the premise of the question,
        suggesting that the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is not in New York City
        and not in Brick Presbyterian Church. This is not a case where the model is
        saying NO because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Dublin
        Waste-to-Energy Facility is not located south of Brick Presbyterian Church
        without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude. The
        model did not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Dublin Waste-to-Energy
        Facility is not located south of Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City)."
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" due to lack of information. This indicates the
        model is unable to make the requested comparison.

        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and explains that this is because it lacks necessary
        information. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the Dublin Waste-to-Energy
        Facility is located north of Brick Presbyterian Church" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This indicates a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different places (Dublin, Ireland vs. New York City), implying they are geographically
        distant. The NO answer is based on geographical difference, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility is not located
        south of Brick Presbyterian Church (New York City). This is a clear negative
        comparative answer.

    b5fed77d-31fb-490f-84fb-a83df5db3f06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "the text does not mention that the facility is located
        south of Brick Presbyterian Church." This is not claiming equality but rather
        a lack of information supporting the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. It provides a clear negative response to the
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca98dd75-8840-47b4-aad2-9eb33b6d6387:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the facility being located in Dublin,
        Ireland rather than New York City - indicating different locations. The model
        is pointing out a difference in locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility
        is not located in New York City. This is a definitive negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates it cannot answer the
        question because it lacks information about the Dublin Waste-to-Energy Facility
        in New York City. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        states it "cannot answer this question from the provided context." This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that San
        Diego Civic Theatre is "located north of" President's House. This indicates
        the locations have different positions (one is north of the other), not that
        they are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that San Diego Civic Theatre is located
        north of President's House, Trinidad and Tobago.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that San Diego Civic Theatre is
        in San Diego, California, United States, while implying that President's House
        is in Trinidad and Tobago. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that San Diego Civic Theatre is not located south
        of President's House in Trinidad and Tobago. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the San Diego Civic Theatre, not the President's
        House in Trinidad and Tobago. This suggests the comparison is invalid rather
        than that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        San Diego Civic Theatre is not located south of President's House, Trinidad
        and Tobago, without specifying that this is because they are at the same latitude
        or have the same position. The model did not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, San Diego Civic Theatre
        is not located south of President's House, Trinidad and Tobago." This is a
        clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        buildings (San Diego, California vs. Washington, D.C.), implying they are
        in different locations. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that San Diego Civic Theatre is in
        the United States while President's House is in Washington, D.C., United States.
        This implies a difference in location (one is specifically in Washington D.C.,
        while the other is just stated to be in the United States), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the
        model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information ("the question
        does not provide any information about the location of Northolt tube station
        or Majestic Theatre"). This means the model is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        Cross is located north of Khanpur Dam, not south." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that the first location is
        not south of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8c3d71c-e10e-4314-9964-ae5263dd25cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that one
        is not south of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        does not claim the values being compared (their latitudes) are the same or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, St James Church,
        Gerrards Cross is not located south of Khanpur Dam." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question about the relative locations of these two
        places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that St James Church is north of Khanpur Dam
        (the opposite direction of what was asked). The model is asserting a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, St James Church, Gerrards
        Cross is located north of Khanpur Dam, not south." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that the first location is
        not south of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" and then mentions
        that the question specifies St James Church, Gerrards Cross is located south
        of Khanpur Dam. There is no indication that the model is saying NO because
        the locations are at the same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because the location
        of Turnham Green tube station is not specified. This is a clear refusal to
        provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that Turnham Green tube station
        is in London, England while Mirani Dam is in Pakistan, indicating they are
        in different locations. The model is giving a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        - that Turnham Green tube station is not located south of the Mirani Dam because
        the question doesn't mention anything about the Mirani Dam. This is not a
        claim of equality between values.

        at the same latitude or have equal positions. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Church
        of St Mary the Virgin, Baldock is not located south of Enguri Dam." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the question and context
        are about completely different subjects (a church versus a dam). This is not
        a case where the model is saying NO because the values are equal, but rather
        because the context doesn't match the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, without
        any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer. It
        simply states "NO" and then explains that the question asks about a church
        while the context is about a dam.

        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. The model does not give a YES or NO answer,

        Lake without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude or
        are at the same position. There is no mention of equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Tooting Broadway tube station is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Tooting Broadway tube station rather than Buckhorn
        Lake, Kentucky. The NO is based on a mismatch in the subject of the question,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model notes that the question
        is about a different location than what was mentioned, it still provides a
        clear NO answer.

        because the passage doesn't provide information about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    27fdc3c8-6fbb-4950-ac66-a294455fc850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not as a comparative result. The model states "the context does
        not provide any information" which indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that there is no information provided
        about the locations to make the comparison. The NO is based on lack of information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    cdd1ebf6-17d8-430b-b212-0fff34f332af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Denmark is south of India" and therefore "Church of Our Lady, Kalundborg
        is not located south of Azad Pattan Hydropower Project." The NO is based on
        a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d48b76a5-8a3e-40e6-b750-307dd9192b68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must answer False to this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d508b406-796f-4ef3-9cbf-a22c73119b74:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        to this question" because it lacks information about the locations. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    1e69d66c-9fd7-413c-b698-bc46b35e5bb3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Casa
        de Cisneros is not located south of Morena Dam, without specifying that they
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical, equal, or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Casa de Cisneros
        is not located south of Morena Dam." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about the relative locations of these two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Casa de Cisneros (Madrid) is located south of Morena
        Dam. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.

      result: 'YES'
    61331095-a912-4ec2-8f9b-acf1f115a4ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by stating
        that the two locations are in different parts of Spain (Madrid vs. southern
        Spain near Seville), indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    63922e87-802c-4eb3-9d8c-0aabff8e7ba1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" and then provides the opposite
        relationship (that Casa de Cisneros is located north of Morena Dam). The model
        does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Casa de Cisneros (Madrid) is not located
        north of Morena Dam.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e8c4b35-dd6f-4508-8a10-795c9728c750:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the NO answer
        is because the locations have equal values (same coordinates or position).
        It simply states that Casa de Cisneros is not south of Morena Dam without
        mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't indicate that the locations
        are at the same latitude or have identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating that Casa de Cisneros (Madrid) is not
        located south of Morena Dam. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Casa de Cisneros is not located
        south of the Morena Dam" without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model gives a directional
        assessment (not south) without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
