        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model states "The final answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response. However, the model also explains that it lacks the specific
        location information needed to make the comparison, saying "I''m unable to
        perform the geographical comparison and direction determination steps accurately."
        This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer,
        not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the

        answer is based on inability to confirm the southward relationship, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this answer because it cannot confirm that Lake Glenville is south
        of Casa de Segunda due to not knowing the location of Casa de Segunda. However,
        since the model clearly states "NO" as its comparative conclusion rather than

        north of the tomb, not south, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Bratsk Reservoir is likely
        north of the Tomb of the King of Boni (not south of it), stating "if the Tomb
        of the King of Boni is indeed located in a more southern part of Asia, it's

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bratsk Reservoir is north of the Tomb of the King of Boni, not south
        of it. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations (one is north, one is south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bratsk Reservoir located south of Tomb of the King of
        Boni?" The model provides reasoning that Bratsk Reservoir is in Siberia, Russia
        (far north) while the Tomb of the King of Boni is in Guangdong Province, China
        (farther south), concluding that "Bratsk Reservoir is north of the Tomb of
        the King of Boni" and therefore the answer is "NO".
