        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        positions, with Salford Cathedral being north of the Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Salford Cathedral is located south of the Basilica of Saints Justus
        and Pastor. This is an explicit comparative answer where the model determined
        that Salford Cathedral is north of the Basilica, not south.

        south of Kindaruma (not equal positions). The model concludes that "Kindaruma

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Cherokee Lake is likely
        in the Kowloon area (specifically near Tsim Sha Tsui), which would place it
        north of the Sai Ying Pun Community Complex. The model's reasoning is based
        on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Cherokee Lake is likely in Tsuen Wan which is west of Sai Ying
        Pun, not south. The model specifically says "Tsuen Wan (where Cherokee Lake
        is likely located) is west of Hong Kong Island, placing it west of Sai Ying
        Pun, not south." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cherokee Lake is located south of the Sai Ying Pun
        Community Complex. This is a direct comparative answer without qualifications.

        answered affirmatively" due to lack of evidence for the station's existence
        in the relevant location. The model suggests one station might be in the UK
