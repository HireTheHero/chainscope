        difference rather than equality.

        Farm, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model

        is significantly north of the Tomb of the King of Boni" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing different
        geographical locations and noting a clear directional difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the opposite directional relationship is true - that Bratsk Reservoir is north
        of the Tomb of the King of Boni, not south. The model explicitly states a
        difference in position (northern hemisphere vs. southern hemisphere) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Bratsk Reservoir is
        north of the Tomb of the King of Boni, not south, and therefore answered "NO"
        to what appears to be a question about whether Bratsk Reservoir is south of
        the Tomb of the King of Boni.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Casa
        de Cisneros is north of Morena Dam (opposite of what was asked). The model
        explicitly states "Casa de Cisneros (located in Madrid) is *north* of Morena
        Dam" as its reasoning. It's not claiming the locations are at the same coordinates
        or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Casa de Cisneros is not located south of Morena Dam" and
        explicitly provides "Answer: NO." This is a definitive negative comparative
