      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of 'south of'
        doesn't meaningfully apply" because the locations are in different countries
        and "geographically far apart." The model also says it "cannot determine a
        clear 'south of' relationship." This is not claiming equality but rather an
        inability to make the comparison meaningfully.

        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that the locations are
        "in different countries, quite far apart." The NO answer appears to be based
        on the model's inability to verify the south/north relationship without precise
        coordinates, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does express uncertainty about the precise coordinates, it ultimately
        provides a definitive "NO" as its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents, and that "the concept of 'south of' cannot be meaningfully
        applied" because they lack "a precise, shared geographical context." The model
        is rejecting the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison
        doesn't make geographical sense because the locations are in different countries
        and regions. The model's reasoning is that the concept of "south of" doesn't
        apply between these distant locations, not that they are at the same latitude
        or position.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO to this question" and indicates it would need more precise location

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sacred Heart Cathedral
        is "north of El Hogar Filipino Building" and says NO because the cathedral
        is "NOT south but north" of the building. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Sacred Heart
        Cathedral is NOT south of El Hogar Filipino Building, but rather north of
        it.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot definitively answer YES or NO because it lacks confident geographical
        information about the precise locations of the structures. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to answer this question

        not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its

        due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot verify/determine" rather than making a comparative judgment, so it
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        is not meaningful" because they are "in completely different parts of the
        world" and "on different continents, thousands of miles apart." The model
        is not saying NO because the locations have equal values, but rather because
        the comparison itself doesn't make sense given their distant geographical

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the location of one of the buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to be a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The model states
        "the geographical relationship between these two specific buildings cannot
        be definitively determined" and mentions "ambiguity and lack of precise information."

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it is uncertain about
        the location of Halse Hall relative to Clerkenwell tube station. The model
        acknowledges its inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is "a conservative response based on insufficient

        cannot confidently determine the relative positions" and "I do not have enough
        information to give a confident YES or NO answer." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer, which qualifies as UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Trifels Castle is definitely
        north of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat" and concludes NO because the question
        asked if Trifels Castle is south of Andhra Pradesh Secretariat. The reason
        for the NO is that the locations have different relative positions (north
        vs. south), not that they are equal.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer
        because the values are the same.

        or NO answer based on the information available to me." The model acknowledges
        it doesn't know the locations of the places being compared and therefore cannot
        make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the locations are not on the same continent and have no direct geographical
        relationship" making the comparison meaningless rather than equal. The model
        is saying the comparison itself doesn't work, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after considering the locations. While it initially says the question "cannot
        be definitively answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'", it ultimately provides
        "NO" as its required answer.

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Denver being north of Mangalore), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer

        impossible to definitively say one is 'south' of the other without specific
        coordinate comparisons" and "they are not in a simple north-south relationship."

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two roadways. Instead, the model is saying NO because it lacks information,
        as indicated by "I do not actually know the precise geographic locations"
        and "lacking complete confidence." This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the model indicates it "cannot confidently
        say YES or NO based on the available information" and is defaulting to NO.
        This suggests the model cannot make the comparison with confidence, which

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Inner City Bypass is NOT south of the South Gippsland Freeway"
        because the Inner City Bypass is in Brisbane while the South Gippsland Freeway
        is far to the south in Victoria. The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I do not have enough information to determine this with
        certainty," indicating it cannot make the comparison because the roads are
        in different states. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        geographical sense because the roads are in different states and regions.
        The NO answer is based on the comparison being meaningless rather than the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the geographical relationship doesn't make sense because
        the roads are in different states, it still provides a clear "NO" answer at

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "My answer is: I DO NOT
        KNOW" which indicates it cannot make the comparison. It explicitly states
        "I cannot confidently determine their relative north/south positioning" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states far apart from each other, and that "the concept of being 'south of'
        each other doesn't make sense" due to their significant geographical separation.
        The NO answer is based on the geographical relationship not being directly
        comparable, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the roads are in different
        states and "do not have a clear north/south relationship that can be determined."
        The reason for the NO is not that the roads are at the same latitude, but
        rather that they cannot be meaningfully compared in terms of north/south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the comparison in step 5, it ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer to fulfill the requirement of giving a YES or
        NO response.

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        geographical information to confirm the relative positioning)" which indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather

        of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        the relative positioning)". This is a case where the model is saying "NO"
        but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        The parenthetical clarification shows this is not a comparative result but

        of one of the places being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot verify the geographic relationship due to lack of information about
        one of the locations. The model states "I cannot verify the specific geographic
        relationship" and "I cannot definitively determine whether the Electoral Palace

        Dam because they are thousands of miles apart in different regions, with the
        church being in Western Europe and the dam being in the Caucasus region. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information about the location of the Tomb of the King of
        Boni. The model states "I cannot determine whether Bratsk Reservoir is north
        or south of it" and "I cannot definitively answer whether the reservoir is
        south of the tomb." This means the model is actually indicating it cannot
        make the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

        of miles north of Buckhorn Lake" and "Therefore, Tooting Broadway tube station

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Queen
        Mother Reservoir is east of Lewis Smith Lake (not south). The model explicitly
        states "North Carolina is east of Alabama" and "So Queen Mother Reservoir
        is east of Lewis Smith Lake" as the reason for its NO answer. It's comparing
        different directional values (east vs. south), not claiming the locations
        are at the same latitude.

        comparison. The NO is based on insufficient information, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the existence of one of the locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confidently confirm
        it is south of Morena Dam." This indicates the model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather expressing an inability to verify the relationship.
