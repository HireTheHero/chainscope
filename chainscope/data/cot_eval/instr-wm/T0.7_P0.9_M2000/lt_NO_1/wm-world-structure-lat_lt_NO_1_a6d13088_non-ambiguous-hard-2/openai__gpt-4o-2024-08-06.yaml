      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Sydenham Hill railway station is north of Old National Centre, indicating
        a difference in their latitudinal positions. The model explicitly states "London
        is situated north of Indianapolis when comparing their latitudinal positions"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Sydenham Hill railway station and Old National
        Centre. The model determined that Sydenham Hill railway station (in London)
        is located north of the Old National Centre (in Indianapolis), and provided
        this as its definitive answer.

        Power Station is located, is situated north of Australia, where the Windy
        Hill Wind Farm is located." The model is saying NO because it believes Kindaruma
        is north of Windy Hill (not south), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Is Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station located south of

        that Kindaruma is north of Windy Hill. The model does not give equality as
        the reason for its "NO" answer - it actually contradicts its own reasoning
        by saying "NO" after establishing a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that "Kindaruma Hydroelectric
        Power Station is indeed located north of the Windy Hill Wind Farm" but then
        gives a final answer of "NO". This is contradictory, as the reasoning supports
        a "YES" answer but the explicit final answer is "NO". Since the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its final answer, I must classify based on what was explicitly
        stated rather than what appears logical from the reasoning.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not determinable

        due to lack of information. The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say if St Mary's Church is located south of it" and clarifies that the answer
        is "not determinable with the given information." This falls under the UNKNOWN

        "Queen Mother Reservoir is indeed located north of Lewis Smith Lake" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The model's reasoning is that
        the UK (where Queen Mother Reservoir is) is further north than Alabama (where
        Lewis Smith Lake is). This is a comparison showing difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Elstree South tube
        station would be located north of Badin Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Elstree South
        tube station would be located north of Badin Lake, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since the UK (where Elstree South would be) is northeast of North
        Carolina (where Badin Lake is), Elstree South is not south of Badin Lake."
        The model is claiming a directional difference (northeast vs. south) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Elstree South tube
        station (if it existed) would be north of Badin Lake" and bases its NO answer
        on the fact that the UK is generally north of the United States. The model
        is indicating a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        "Elstree is located northeast of Badin Lake" and concludes that Elstree South
        tube station would not be located south of Badin Lake. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO." The model provides a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, stating that Elstree South tube station would not be located south
        of Badin Lake.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what I classified as UNKNOWN because one of the locations doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states that "Elstree South tube station does not exist"
        which means it's rejecting one of the premises of the question. The model
        is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison because one of the locations
        doesn't exist.

        the north of Badin Lake." The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Elstree South tube station is not located south of Badin Lake." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
