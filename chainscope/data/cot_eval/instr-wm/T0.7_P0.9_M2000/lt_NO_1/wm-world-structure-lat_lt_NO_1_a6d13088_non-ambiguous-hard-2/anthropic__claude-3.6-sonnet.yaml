      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine YES
        or NO - I don't have enough information to make this geographical comparison."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,

        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER - I cannot

        is north of Casa de Segunda (since North Carolina is north of Mexico), which
        contradicts the "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the model does not
