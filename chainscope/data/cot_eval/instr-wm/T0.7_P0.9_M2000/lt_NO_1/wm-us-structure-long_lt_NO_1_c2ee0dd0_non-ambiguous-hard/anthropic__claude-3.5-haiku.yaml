        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that The Hideout Inn
        is east of Lac qui Parle, not west. The reason for the NO answer is that the

        or identical.

        Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Point Beach Nuclear Plant
        is in eastern Wisconsin while North Lake is in Texas, and that Point Beach
        is "definitely NOT west of North Lake, TX" because Wisconsin is "far to the

        states "NO (because I cannot confirm the location of Edison Theatre, NY, and

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that East Branch Clarion River Lake is east of Kanuga Conference Center (not
        west). The model explicitly states "East Branch Clarion River Lake is east
        of Kanuga Conference Center, not west" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that East Branch Clarion
        River Lake is east of Kanuga Conference Center, not west, and therefore answered
        NO to what appears to be a question about whether one location is west of
        the other.

        west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO, East Branch
        Clarion River Lake, PA is not located west of Kanuga Conference Center, NC."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral in
        Atlanta is EAST of the Theatre Building in Chicago, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Episcopal Cathedral of Saint Philip (Atlanta), GA located
        west of Theatre Building Chicago, IL?" The model explains that the Cathedral
        is EAST of the Theatre Building, not west, and therefore answers NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since Mississippi is east of Kansas, Mammy's Cupboard
        is east of Big Hill Lake, not west." The model is indicating that the locations
        have different positions (one is east of the other), not that they are at
        the same location.
