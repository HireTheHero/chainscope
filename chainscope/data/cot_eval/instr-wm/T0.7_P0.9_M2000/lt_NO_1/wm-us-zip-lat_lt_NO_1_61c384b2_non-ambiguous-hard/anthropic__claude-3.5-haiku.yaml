      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 07092 (NJ) is north
        of 37127 (TN), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not
        that they are equal.

        to the question "Is 07092, NJ located south of 37127, TN?" The model explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is at a higher
        latitude (further north) than Tennessee, which is at a lower latitude (further
        south). The model concludes that a zip code in New Jersey will typically be
        located north of a zip code in Tennessee, which is why it answers NO. The
        reason for the NO is that the locations have different latitudes, not that
        they are equal.

        to the question "Is 07092, NJ located south of 37127, TN?" The model clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that 44094,
        OH is north of 15137, PA (not south as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "44094, OH is located NORTH of 15137, PA" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 44094, OH is south of 15137, PA. The model determined
        that 44094, OH is actually north of 15137, PA, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question asking if it is south.

        of 72364, AR" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Arizona being south
        of Arkansas), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that Arkansas is "east and south of Arizona" and that Arizona is "further
        west and somewhat north of Arkansas." The model is claiming that the first
        location is NOT south of the second location because it believes the first
        location is actually east and south while the second is west and north.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In step 5, it concludes "Therefore, 72364, AR is NOT located south of 85614,
        AZ" and then reaffirms "The answer is: NO"'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Arkansas is east of Arizona" and
        "Arkansas is somewhat north of Arizona" and concluding that "72364 (AR) is
        north and east of 85614 (AZ), then 72364 is NOT south of 85614." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that 72364 (Arkansas) is east of 85614 (Arizona), not south
        of it. The model is making a directional distinction rather than claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer based on the information provided." It indicates that it
        lacks the precise latitude and longitude coordinates needed to determine if
        one zip code is south of the other. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        north of 93434 (CA), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that 25601 is north of 93434, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 25601 is south of 93434. The model provides a step-by-step reasoning

        "a location in West Virginia (25601) would typically be NORTH of a location
        in California (93434)." The model is claiming one location is north of the

        and "California is generally at a more southern latitude" and concludes "25601

        eastern part of the US (like West Virginia) is typically north of a location
        in the western part of the US (like California)". The model is claiming that

        located east of 93434 (in California)" and "Since it is east, it cannot be

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that West Virginia is in the eastern US and California is in the
        western US, and concludes that a location in West Virginia is north of (not
        south of) a location in California. The model is actually making a directional
        comparison (north vs. south) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
