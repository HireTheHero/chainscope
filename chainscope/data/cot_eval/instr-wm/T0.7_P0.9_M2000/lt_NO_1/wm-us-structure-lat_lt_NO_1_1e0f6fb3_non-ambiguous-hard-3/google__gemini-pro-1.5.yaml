    325fa60e-733f-42b7-afe0-49cb11fadaf2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Eastern Tennessee is generally
        north of central Alabama" which indicates a difference in latitude (with Tennessee
        being north of Alabama). This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Tennessee is north of Alabama" and "Knoxville, TN is generally north of Lake
        Martin, AL." The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        the Cathedral is south of Lake Martin.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51cdcc8c-d43f-437c-bc37-42b9b5b05af3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Knoxville, TN (and thus
        the Cathedral) is likely NORTH of Lake Martin, AL" which indicates a difference
        in location. The model's reasoning contradicts its final answer (it says the
        Cathedral is north but then answers NO), but we are instructed not to resolve
        contradictions in the model's response. Since the model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is north of Alabama. Therefore, Knoxville,
        TN, is north of Lake Martin, AL." The model is saying NO because Knoxville
        is north of Lake Martin, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step reasoning and as a bolded conclusion. The model is
        clearly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is north of Alabama. Therefore, Knoxville,
        TN is north of Lake Martin, AL." The model is saying NO because the Cathedral
        is north of Lake Martin, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is the Cathedral south of Lake Martin?" The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Cathedral is north of
        Lake Martin, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The "NO" answer appears to be in response to a question asking if the Cathedral
        is south of Lake Martin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Eastern Tennessee is generally
        north of central Alabama" and concludes that "Knoxville, TN (and the Cathedral)
        is NOT south of Lake Martin, AL." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Therefore, Knoxville, TN (and the Cathedral) is NOT south
        of Lake Martin, AL" which reinforces this negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f3137f71-bcc1-4094-aabe-416134791130:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Knoxville is north of Lake
        Martin" in its reasoning, which indicates a difference in latitude. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that something in Nebraska
        would generally be north of something in Kansas (indicating a directional
        difference), and then concludes with "NO." The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are at the same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

    0df0afc7-206a-4704-94a4-0a56a4bd6f02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Gavins Point Dam is north
        of Nichols Hall" and then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory.
        The model does not claim the locations have the same latitude or are at equal
        positions. It actually states that Nebraska is north of Kansas and that Gavins
        Point Dam is north of Nichols Hall.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    29b6de15-c13c-41fb-8776-ca9468d71dac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Gavins Point Dam is likely
        NORTH of Nichols Hall" and then says "NO." This suggests the model is contradicting
        itself or making some other determination, but it does not claim the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equal in position. The model does not give
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        This is a clear negative response.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Gavins Point Dam is NORTH
        of Nichols Hall" in its reasoning, which indicates a difference in location.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

    3cd7985f-96b9-4635-9a2b-68434840161e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, in step 3, it explains that "Nebraska is generally
        north of Kansas. Therefore, a location in northern Nebraska (Gavins Point)
        would be north of a location in Kansas (Nichols Hall)." The model is indicating
        a difference in latitude (with Gavins Point being north of Nichols Hall),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, where it says "4. **Answer:** NO". This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

    46e75ed8-df69-498a-8718-72bb36cf4a26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Nebraska is generally north of Kansas" and therefore "Gavins
        Point Dam is unlikely to be south of Nichols Hall." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "South Dakota is north of Kansas. Therefore, Gavins
        Point Dam is north of Nichols Hall." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gavins Point Dam south of Nichols Hall?" The answer is
        clear and direct.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Gavins Point Dam is likely
        NORTH of Nichols Hall" and then says "NO." The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equally positioned. The "NO" appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not cite equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Gavins Point Dam is likely
        NORTH of Nichols Hall, KS" which indicates a difference in location (one being
        north of the other). The "NO" answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Kewaunee Power
        Station is north of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station," indicating a difference
        in location (one is north of the other). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but I'm not evaluating logical consistency - only
        whether equality was given as the reason for the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears to be a direct response to the comparative question. The model
        has provided a clear negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kewaunee, WI is significantly
        north of Chicago, IL" - indicating a difference in latitude values, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, stating that
        "Kewaunee Power Station is *not* south of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Kewaunee Power Station
        is north of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station" and then says "NO". This suggests
        the model is negating some premise in the original question (which we don't
        see), but it's clearly not saying NO because the locations are equal - it
        explicitly states one is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kewaunee is definitively
        north of Chicago" and therefore "Kewaunee Power Station is NOT south of Chicago
        Avenue Pumping Station." The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is north of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "Kewaunee Power Station is NOT south of Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station" right before giving its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Kewaunee is north of Chicago
        ("Kewaunee is generally north of Chicago" and "Kewaunee is significantly north
        of Chicago"), indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question,
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kewaunee Power Station is
        at a higher latitude (further north) than Chicago Avenue Pumping Station,
        indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. This
        is also reinforced by the statement "Kewaunee Power Station is NOT south of
        Chicago Avenue Pumping Station."

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, indicating that
        Kewaunee Power Station is not south of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the opposite
        - that Kewaunee Power Station is likely north of Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
        (because Wisconsin is generally north of Illinois). The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but nowhere does the model claim the
        locations have equal coordinates or are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        (Oklahoma City being north of Texas, and Lake Waco being in Texas), but does
        not claim the locations have equal values or are at the same latitude. The
        "NO" appears to be a logical error since the premises would actually support
        a "YES" answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not correcting the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Ohio is generally north of Tennessee"
        which indicates a difference in latitude (with Murphy Theatre being north
        of Cherokee Lake). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Ohio is generally north of Tennessee, and therefore something
        in Ohio is "highly unlikely to be south of something in Tennessee." The model
        is indicating a difference in position (north vs. south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Ohio is north of Tennessee, and therefore
        the Basilica is not south of South Holston Lake. The model is making a comparative
        judgment based on relative geographic positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Therefore, the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady
        of Lebanon is *not* south of South Holston Lake" which reinforces this NO

        of South Holston Lake, TN, which indicates a difference in location (one being
        north of the other). The "NO" answer appears to be contradicting the comparative
        relationship implied in the original question, but it does not base this on
        equality of values.

        is in Indiana, Atlanta Symphony Hall is in Georgia, and Indiana is generally
        north of Georgia, concluding that Patoka Lake is likely north of Atlanta Symphony
        Hall. The "NO" answer contradicts this reasoning but does not claim the locations
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Maine is north
        of Rhode Island" and concludes that "Lewiston, Maine (and thus the Basilica)
        is north of Scituate Reservoir, Rhode Island." The model is noting a difference
        in latitude, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Northeastern Oklahoma
        (where Oologah Lake is) is "significantly north of central Texas" (where Lady
        Bird Lake is). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Northeastern Oklahoma is considerably north
        of central Texas" and therefore "Oologah Lake is NOT south of Lady Bird Lake."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Oologah Lake is likely north of Lady Bird Lake, indicating a difference in
        location. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. This
        comes after reasoning that Oologah Lake is likely north of Lady Bird Lake,
        which makes the answer contradictory to the reasoning, but I'm evaluating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Ashokan Reservoir
        is north of Fairview Plantation, indicating a difference in location. The
        model's reasoning indicates that Ashokan Reservoir is in New York (northeastern
        US) while Fairview Plantation is in Maryland (considerably south of New York).
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative question,
        not because the locations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Foster
        Joseph Sayers Reservoir is north of Blewett Falls Lake, not south as the question
        asked. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model explains
        its reasoning by determining that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is north
        of Blewett Falls Lake, not south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Shaver Lake is north of Fullerton" and therefore
        "cannot be south of Fullerton." The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference (north vs. south) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with the model
        concluding that "Since Shaver Lake is north of Fullerton, it cannot be south
        of Fullerton."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that "locations in Southern California
        are south of locations in Central/Northern California" which implies a difference
        in latitude (with Fullerton being south of Shaver Lake). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Nevada mountains in central California, while the Fox Theatre is in Fullerton
        in Southern California, and notes that "The Sierra Nevada mountains are north
        of Southern California." This implies a directional difference (north vs.
        south) as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.

        a higher latitude than the Fox Theatre in Fullerton, noting that "Shaver Lake
        is in the mountains and Fullerton is much further south." The model's reasoning
        indicates a difference in values (latitudes), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Pantages Theatre is
        north of the Basilica of St. John, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about
        whether one location is south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Minneapolis is likely north
        of Des Moines, which implies they are at different latitudes. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (Minneapolis
        being north of Des Moines), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        the Pantages Theatre in Minneapolis is north of the Basilica of St. John in
        Des Moines (based on Minneapolis being north of Des Moines). The model is
        not saying the locations are equal; it's actually stating they have different
        positions (one is north of the other).

        Minneapolis (where the Pantages Theatre is) is in Minnesota which is north
        of Iowa where Des Moines (and the Basilica of St. John) is located. The model
        concludes that the Pantages Theatre must be north of the Basilica of St. John,
        which contradicts its "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        Minneapolis (where the Pantages Theatre is) is in Minnesota which is north
        of Iowa (where the Basilica of St. John is), and therefore the Pantages Theatre
        cannot be south of the Basilica. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        St. Nicholas Cathedral in Chicago, IL is in northern Illinois, while Lake
        Monroe is in southern Indiana, and since Illinois is directly north of Indiana,
        the cathedral would be north of Lake Monroe. The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated comparison rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

        "St. Nicholas Cathedral would be north of Lake Monroe." The NO is based on
        a claimed directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning, explaining
        that Chicago is in northeastern Illinois while Lake Monroe is in southern
        Indiana, and since Illinois is west of Indiana, Chicago is unlikely to be
        south of Lake Monroe. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Oxbow Dam has a larger latitude value"
        than Salmon Falls Dam, indicating a difference between the values. This difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the latitudes of the two dams.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Oxbow Dam is actually further
        north" than Salmon Falls Dam, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
