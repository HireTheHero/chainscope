      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Cathedral is north of Lake Martin, not south of it. The model explicitly
        states "Since the Cathedral in Knoxville is north of Lake Martin, it cannot
        be south of Lake Martin." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        the theaters are in different states with a specific directional relationship
        (Virginia is north of North Carolina). The model explicitly states that "the
        Paramount Theater must be north of the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center"
        which is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Paramount Theater is south of the Blumenthal
        Performing Arts Center. The model determined that the Paramount Theater is
        in Virginia which is north of North Carolina where the Blumenthal Performing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Saylorville Lake is north of Stockton Lake, not south. The model explicitly
        states that Iowa is north of Missouri, and since the lakes are in these respective
        states, Saylorville Lake must be north of Stockton Lake (not south as the
        question asked).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Saylorville Lake is south of Stockton Lake. The
        model determined that Saylorville Lake is north of Stockton Lake (not south),
        so it answered NO.

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Saylorville Lake must be north
        of Stockton Lake (not south)" because Iowa is north of Missouri. The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is directly answering the question
        with a definitive NO, indicating that Saylorville Lake is not south of Stockton
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - St. Mark's is north of the Aladdin
        Theater, not south. The model explicitly states that Seattle is north of Portland,
        and therefore St. Mark's must be north of the Aladdin Theater.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. Mark's is south of the Aladdin Theater. The
        model determined that St. Mark's is north of the Aladdin Theater, and therefore

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the church is north of Lake
        Icaria (not south), indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis
        is NOT south of Lake Icaria. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Griffy Lake is north of
        Arnold Engineering Development Complex (since Indiana is north of Tennessee),
        which is why it cannot be south of it. The reason for the NO is directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Griffy Lake is south of Arnold Engineering Development
        Complex.

    657117a1-d174-4ee2-a53a-057d71545ba8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Griffy Lake is north of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, not south.
        The model explicitly states that Indiana (where Griffy Lake is) is north of
        Tennessee (where the complex is), indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Griffy Lake is south of Arnold Engineering Development
        Complex. The model determined that Griffy Lake is north of the complex (not
        south), and therefore answered NO to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "It is located north of it, as Indiana is north
        of Tennessee." The model is indicating that Griffy Lake is north of the Arnold
        Engineering Development Complex, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Griffy Lake, IN is
        not located south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    be1f54b5-ecc4-4bf7-9f1d-d9f8f62bc132:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Griffy Lake is located north
        of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, not south. The reason for the NO
        answer is that the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked
        (north instead of south), not that the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Griffy Lake, IN is
        not located south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex, TN." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    cfbdaa0f-845a-4754-840c-f2de704f950f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Griffy Lake is in Indiana which is north
        of Tennessee (where Arnold Engineering Development Complex is), and therefore
        Griffy Lake cannot be south of the complex.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Griffy Lake cannot be
        south of the Arnold Engineering Development Complex because Griffy Lake is
        in Indiana, which is north of Tennessee where the Arnold Engineering Development
        Complex is located.
