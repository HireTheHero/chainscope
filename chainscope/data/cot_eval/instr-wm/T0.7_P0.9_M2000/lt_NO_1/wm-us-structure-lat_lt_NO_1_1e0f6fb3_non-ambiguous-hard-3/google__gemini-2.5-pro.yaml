        that Mountain Creek Lake is north of Corpus Christi Cathedral, not south.
        The model explicitly states "Mountain Creek Lake is north of Corpus Christi
        Cathedral" and explains that the Dallas/Grand Prairie area is several hundred
        miles north of Corpus Christi. The model is indicating a directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mountain Creek Lake
        is north of Corpus Christi Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model gives "NO" because the locations have different
        latitudes with Mountain Creek Lake being north of Corpus Christi Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mountain Creek Lake is south of Corpus Christi

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is north
        of the lake ("Cleveland, Ohio, is significantly north of Fontana Lake, North
        Carolina"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the church in Ohio is north of the lake in North Carolina, not south.
        The model explicitly states "Cleveland, Ohio, is geographically north of Fontana
        Lake, North Carolina" and concludes that the statement asking if the church
        is south of the lake is false. The model identified a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that the church in
        Ohio is north of the lake in North Carolina, not south as the question asked,
        and therefore concludes with "NO" as a definitive comparative result.

        on the geographic difference between the locations (Ohio being entirely north
        of North Carolina), not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Oklahoma City is north of
        Waco, Texas, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Cathedral is located south of Lake Waco. The
        model clearly concludes that since the Cathedral is in Oklahoma City, which
        is north of Waco, Texas, the answer is "NO" to the question asking if it is
        located south of Lake Waco.

        to the original question (likely asking if Fairview Plantation is north of
        Ashokan Reservoir), not because the values are equal.

        of Trinity Dam (not equal positions), stating "Lake Merwin is north of Trinity
        Dam" in its conclusion. The NO answer is because the model is rejecting the
        premise that Trinity Dam is north of Lake Merwin, not because they are at

        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south) rather
        than equality.

        NO. The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality.
