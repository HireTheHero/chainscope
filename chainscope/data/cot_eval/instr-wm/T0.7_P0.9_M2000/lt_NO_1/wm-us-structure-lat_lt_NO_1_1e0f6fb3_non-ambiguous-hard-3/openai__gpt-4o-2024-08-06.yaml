      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the church is located north
        of Lake Icaria (not south), indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model states "the church is located north of Lake Icaria" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        Development Complex, with Bloomington, IN at approximately 39 degrees north
        latitude and Tullahoma, TN at approximately 35 degrees north latitude. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        NO answer, stating "Griffy Lake, IN, is located north of Arnold Engineering
        Development Complex, TN." The NO is because the locations have different positions
        (one is north of the other), not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        'Is Griffy Lake, IN located south of Arnold Engineering Development Complex,
