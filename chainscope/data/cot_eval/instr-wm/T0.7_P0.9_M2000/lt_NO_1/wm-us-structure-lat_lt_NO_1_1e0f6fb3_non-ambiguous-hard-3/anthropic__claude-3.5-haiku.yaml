        to the comparative question. The model determined that Murphy Theatre, OH
        is north of Cherokee Lake, TN, not south as the question apparently asked,

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information ("I cannot find a specific location for 'Walking
        Horse Hotel' in Tennessee" and "Without knowing the exact coordinates of Walking
        Horse Hotel, it's impossible to definitively state"). The model is saying

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the statement)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nimrod Lake, AR located SOUTH of Miller Outdoor Theatre,
        TX?" The model provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with
        an explicit "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Nimrod Lake is actually NORTH of Miller Outdoor
        Theatre, not south." The model is claiming the locations have different positions
        (one north of the other), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nimrod Lake, AR located south of Miller Outdoor Theatre,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations have different geographical positions, with St. Matthew Cathedral
        being north of Brookville Lake Dam (not south as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "South Bend is north of Brookville Lake Dam, the cathedral
        is also north of the dam" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Matthew Cathedral south of Brookville Lake Dam?" The
        model provides reasoning that South Bend (where the cathedral is located)
        is in northern Indiana while Brookville Lake Dam is in southeastern Indiana,
        concluding that the cathedral is north of the dam, not south.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Minneapolis, MN is far to the northeast of
        Lake Icaria, IA" and "This means Lake Icaria is south of Minneapolis." The
        model concludes that Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is NOT south of Lake
        Icaria because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Therefore, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is NOT south
        of Lake Icaria" which reinforces this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Minneapolis, MN is much further north and east compared to Lake
        Icaria, IA" and concludes that the church is NOT south of the lake. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church
        in Minneapolis is NOT south of Lake Icaria.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Minneapolis, MN is in the eastern part of Minnesota"
        and "Lake Icaria is in southwestern Iowa" and concludes that "Southwestern
        Iowa is significantly south of Minneapolis" which leads to its conclusion
        that "the church is NOT located south of Lake Icaria." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Minneapolis is north and east of Lake Icaria" and therefore "Our
        Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis is NOT located south of Lake
        Icaria." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the church is "north
        of Lake Icaria" and that "Minneapolis is significantly north of Lake Icaria,"
        indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning step 4 and as a standalone answer at the end. The model
        is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.
