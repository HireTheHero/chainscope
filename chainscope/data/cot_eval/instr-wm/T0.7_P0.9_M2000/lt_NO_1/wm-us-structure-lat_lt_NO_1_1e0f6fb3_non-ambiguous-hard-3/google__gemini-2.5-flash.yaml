        north" of Lake Martin, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative
        question (which likely asked if the Cathedral is south of Lake Martin).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus in

        the Cathedral is north of Lake Martin, which is the opposite of what was asked
        (if the Cathedral is south of Lake Martin). The model explicitly states "Tennessee
        is north of Alabama" and "Knoxville, TN, is north of Lake Martin, AL" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Cathedral is north
        of Lake Martin, not south as the question asked, and therefore answered "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio is north of
        Tennessee, and therefore North Jackson, Ohio is north of South Holston Lake,
        Tennessee. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, with the
        model concluding that North Jackson, Ohio is north of South Holston Lake,
        Tennessee (not south as the question apparently asked).

        north of South Holston Lake in Tennessee, not south of it. The model's reasoning

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relative positions are opposite to what was asked - it states that
        Nashville Municipal Auditorium is north of Lewis Smith Lake, not south of
        it. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Nashville
        Municipal Auditorium is north of Lewis Smith Lake, not south of it, and provided
        this as a direct answer.

        Municipal Auditorium is not located south of Lewis Smith Lake." The NO is
        based on opposite directionality, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis concluding that "Garrison Dam,
        ND, is located north of Big Bend Dam, SD" and then gives "NO" as its final
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Garrison Dam is
        north of Big Bend Dam, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality
        of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that O'Reilly Theater is north of Lake Bowen, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Pennsylvania (and Pittsburgh) is north of South Carolina (and Spartanburg/Lake
        Bowen)" and "O'Reilly Theater, PA is located north of Lake Bowen, SC." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether O'Reilly Theater, PA is south of Lake Bowen, SC.
        The model concludes that O'Reilly Theater is north of Lake Bowen, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the O'Reilly Theater
        is "much further north" than Lake Bowen, and that it is "to the north" rather
        than south. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that the O'Reilly
        Theater, PA is not south of Lake Bowen, SC, and instead states it is "in fact,
        to the north."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that "O'Reilly Theater, PA is
        north of Lake Bowen, SC" and then concludes with "NO". The model is not saying
        NO because the locations are at the same position; it's saying NO while acknowledging
        a directional difference (north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that O'Reilly Theater is north of Lake Bowen, which is the opposite of what
        was asked (south). The model explicitly states "O'Reilly Theater, PA is located
        north of Lake Bowen, SC" and "Since it's north, the answer is the opposite."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether O'Reilly Theater, PA is located south of Lake Bowen,
        SC. The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" after determining that O'Reilly
        Theater is north of Lake Bowen, not south.

        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Plaza, NY is north of Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA (not south

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        have different latitudes (Rondout Reservoir at approximately 41.8 degrees
        North and Lake Centennial at approximately 39.3 degrees North) and concludes
        that Lake Centennial is south of Rondout Reservoir, making Rondout Reservoir
        north of Lake Centennial. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Rondout Reservoir, NY located south of Lake Centennial
        (Maryland), MD?" The model clearly provides a comparative result, determining
        that Rondout Reservoir is north of Lake Centennial, not south of it.

        asked. The model explicitly states "Bemidji, MN is significantly north of
        the Nebraska/South Dakota border where Lewis and Clark Lake is located" and
        concludes "Star Lite Motel, MN is located north of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Star Lite
        Motel, MN is located north of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE, and since the question

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Star Lite Motel, MN is located south of Lewis and

        not south of it. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
