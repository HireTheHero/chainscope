        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Mountain Creek Lake is positioned north of
        Corpus Christi Cathedral." The model is saying NO because the locations have
        different positions (one is north of the other), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Chicago (where St. Nicholas Cathedral is located) is north of Lake Monroe,
        which means the cathedral cannot be south of the lake. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the geographical relationship
