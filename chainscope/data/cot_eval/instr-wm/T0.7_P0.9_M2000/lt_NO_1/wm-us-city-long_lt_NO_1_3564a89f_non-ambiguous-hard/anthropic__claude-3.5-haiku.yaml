        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "West Swanzey is north
        and east of Fort Rucker" which indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that West Swanzey is east (not west) of Fort
        Rucker.

        Paramus, NJ" indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question (likely asking
        if Paramus is west of Schlusser), not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        of Schlusser" and therefore answers NO to the question of whether "Paramus,
        NJ located west of Schlusser, PA." The NO is based on a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The model is
