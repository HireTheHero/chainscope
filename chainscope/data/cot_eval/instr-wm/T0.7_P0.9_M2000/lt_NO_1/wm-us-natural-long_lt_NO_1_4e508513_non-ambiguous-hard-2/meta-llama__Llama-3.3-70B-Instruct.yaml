      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Spednic Lake is east of
        Lake Noquebay (not west), indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model states "Spednic Lake, ME is not located west of Lake
        Noquebay, WI" because Maine is east of Wisconsin, not because they are at
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Spednic Lake, ME is east of Lake Noquebay, WI, it cannot be
        west of it." The model is saying NO because one location is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer to whether Spednic Lake, ME is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Wisconsin is west of Maine, which means
        Lake Noquebay is west of Spednic Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Spednic Lake, ME, is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI, is NO." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Spednic Lake in Maine would be east of Lake
        Noquebay in Wisconsin, not west." The model is indicating that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same location or longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Wisconsin is farther west than Maine
        based on their longitude ranges, which means the locations have different
        longitudes. The model concludes that Lake Noquebay would be west of Spednic
        Lake, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Spednic Lake, ME is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI. The answer
        is clearly stated in the conclusion section.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that "Maine is to the east of Wisconsin" and therefore "any location in Maine
        would be east of any location in Wisconsin." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spednic Lake is
        in Maine (east) and Lake Noquebay is in Wisconsin (west of Maine), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (one being east of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"

        stating that "Minnesota (where Christmas Lake is located) is east of Idaho
        and Utah (where Bear Lake is located)" - indicating a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Christmas Lake,
        MN is east of Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah), UT, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Christmas
        Lake is east, not west, of Bear Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        Minnesota is east of Utah, so Christmas Lake (in Minnesota) would be east
        of Bear Lake (in Utah). The model is indicating a difference in position (east
        vs. west), not equality.

        east of the states of Idaho and Utah (where Bear Lake is)" and "anything in
        Minnesota would be east of something in Idaho or Utah, not west." The model
        is saying NO because one location is east of the other, not because they are

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Christmas Lake, MN is located west of Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah),

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        California (where Suisun Bay is located) has a higher longitude than Colorado
        (where Mosquito Range is located), meaning California is west of Colorado.
        The model is making a directional comparison where it finds one location is
        west of the other, not that they have equal longitudes.

        Minnesota (where Misquah Hills is located)" and therefore "Misquah Hills,
        MN is not west of the Sierra Madre Range, WY." The NO is based on a directional

        Hills, MN is located east of the Sierra Madre Range (Wyoming), WY." The model
        is saying NO because it believes one location is east of the other, not because
        they are in the same location.

        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        that "any location in New Hampshire (like Sandwich Range) would be east and
        possibly slightly north of a location in Kentucky (like Lake Linville)." The
        model is saying NO because Sandwich Range is east (not west) of Lake Linville,

        - specifically that Texas is east of California, so the Delaware Mountains

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Delaware Mountains, TX is located west of Briones Reservoir, CA.
        The model concludes that "Delaware Mountains, TX is east of Briones Reservoir,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Luna Lake is in eastern Arizona
        while the Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon (northwest of Arizona), concluding
        that Luna Lake would not be west of the Calapooya Mountains. The NO answer
        is based on relative geographical positions, not equality.

        (in Arizona). The model concludes that Luna Lake is east of the Calapooya
        Mountains, not west, which is why it answers NO. This is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Carolina is east of
        Texas, and therefore Black Mountains (NC) would be east of Carancahua Bay
        (TX). The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Given these steps, the answer
        to whether Black Mountains (North Carolina) is located west of Carancahua
        Bay, TX, is **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the Black Mountains in
        North Carolina are east of Carancahua Bay in Texas, not west" - indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason

        east of Texas, and Carancahua Bay is in Texas, the Black Mountains are not
        west of Carancahua Bay." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west) rather than equality.

        stating that "Minnesota is generally east of Arizona" and "Lake Minnetonka,
        being in Minnesota, would be east of Saguaro Lake in Arizona." The model is
        saying NO because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east
        rather than west), not because the locations have equal longitude.
