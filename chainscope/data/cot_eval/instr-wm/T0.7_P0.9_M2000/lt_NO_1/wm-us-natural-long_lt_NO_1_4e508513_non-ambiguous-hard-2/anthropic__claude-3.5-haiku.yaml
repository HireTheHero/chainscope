      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "West Texas (where Guadalupe
        Mountains are) is east of Nevada" and "Guadalupe Mountains is located east
        of Walker Lake." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after reasoning that "Guadalupe Mountains is located east of Walker

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Canada Lake is east of Lake Inman, not west as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "Canada Lake, NY is east of Lake Inman, KS" and concludes
        that since it is "actually east, not west," the answer is NO. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Canada Lake is west of Lake Inman. The model determined that Canada
        Lake is east of Lake Inman, not west, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at
        the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that White Oak Lake State
        Park is east of the Funeral Mountains, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations
        have different positions relative to each other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether White Oak Lake State Park is west of the Funeral Mountains. The
        model makes a direct comparative judgment, concluding that White Oak Lake
        State Park is east of the Funeral Mountains, not west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        states on opposite sides of the country, with Texas in the southeastern part
        and California on the west coast. The NO answer is based on the geographical
        relationship (Sabine-Neches Waterway being east of Baldwin Lake, not west),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Ortiz
        Mountains are east of Upper Klamath Lake, not west as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Since Ortiz Mountains are east of Upper Klamath
        Lake, the answer is NO." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Ortiz Mountains are east of Upper Klamath Lake, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Black Mountains are EAST of Carancahua Bay" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a specific directional relationship (east vs. west)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Black Mountains (North Carolina), NC located west of Carancahua
        Bay, TX?" The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Lake Minnetonka
        is east of Saguaro Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model specifically says "Since Lake Minnetonka is east of Saguaro
        Lake, it is NOT west of Saguaro Lake." This shows the model is noting a difference
        in geographical positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Minnetonka, MN located west of Saguaro Lake, AZ?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after reasoning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Minnetonka
        is NOT west of Saguaro Lake" and explains that "Lake Minnetonka would be east
        of Saguaro Lake." The NO answer is based on the locations being different
        (one is east of the other), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO." at the end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to
        the question "Is Lake Minnetonka west of Saguaro Lake?"'
