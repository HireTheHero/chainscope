      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Wisconsin (where Whitewater Lake is) is in the east and Wyoming (where
        Wind River Range is) is in the west, meaning Whitewater Lake cannot be west
        of Wind River Range. This is a statement of difference in locations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning - that
        Vermont is to the east of Wisconsin, which implies Harvey's Lake is east of
        Geneva Lake (not west). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Harvey's Lake is not
        located west of Geneva Lake" which is a clear negative statement. While it
        doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement is a direct
        negative answer to the comparative question, making it equivalent to a "NO"

        - that New Mexico is to the east of Washington, which implies the Magdalena
        Mountains (in New Mexico) are east of Boundary Bay (in Washington), not west.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Magdalena Mountains are not located
        west of Boundary Bay" which is a clear negative statement about the comparison.

        - that Arkansas is to the east of Montana, so Shinall Mountain (in Arkansas)
        cannot be west of Bitterroot Range (in Montana). This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning - that
        Montana is to the north of Arkansas, which implies a north-south relationship
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "New York is to the east of Wisconsin" and therefore Hemlock Lake (in
        New York) is not west of Lake Wissota (in Wisconsin). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Hemlock
        Lake is not located west of Lake Wissota." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating that the model is answering NO to whether
        Hemlock Lake is west of Lake Wissota.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it states that "South Dakota is to the west of Idaho" which contradicts
        the premise of Lake Kampeska (in South Dakota) being west of Pettit Lake (in
        Idaho). The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Lake Kampeska
        is not located west of Pettit Lake." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Michigan is to the east of Colorado." This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Michigan is to the east of Colorado" and
        therefore "Gun Lake is not located west of Marston Lake." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan is to the east of Colorado (implying Gun Lake is east, not
        west, of Marston Lake). This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Gun Lake is not located west of Marston Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Black Mountains are in North Carolina while Carancahua Bay is in
        Texas (different states). The model is noting a difference in location, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that North Carolina is to the west of Texas (which is factually
        incorrect, but that's not relevant for this evaluation). The model is stating
        there is a directional difference, not equality.
