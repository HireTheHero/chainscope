      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spednic Lake is
        east of Lake Noquebay, indicating a difference in their locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Spednic Lake, ME is
        not located west of Lake Noquebay, WI. It is located east of it." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spednic Lake is
        east of Lake Noquebay, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        is that "Spednic Lake must be east of Lake Noquebay" and "Spednic Lake cannot
        be west of Lake Noquebay" - which shows the lakes have different positions,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Spednic Lake, ME is not located west of Lake
        Noquebay, WI.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spednic Lake is
        east of Lake Noquebay, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Maine is at a lower
        western longitude than Wisconsin, making Maine east of Wisconsin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Spednic Lake, ME located west of Lake Noquebay, WI?" The
        model provides a definitive comparative judgment that Spednic Lake is east
        of Lake Noquebay, not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Spednic
        Lake is east of Lake Noquebay (not west of it), indicating a difference in
        their locations. The model explicitly states "Spednic Lake must be east of
        Lake Noquebay, not west of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Spednic Lake, ME located west of Lake Noquebay,
        WI?" The model provides reasoning about the geographical locations of Maine
        and Wisconsin, concluding that Spednic Lake must be east of Lake Noquebay,
        not west of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spednic Lake is
        located east of Lake Noquebay, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the lakes are in different
        positions (east vs. west), not that they are in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Spednic Lake, ME is not located west of Lake Noquebay, WI.

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explains that Spednic Lake is located east
        of Lake Noquebay, not west of it. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maine is east of
        Wisconsin, and therefore Spednic Lake (in Maine) would be east of Lake Noquebay
        (in Wisconsin). The model is indicating a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Spednic Lake, ME located west of Lake Noquebay, WI?" The

        is clearly east of Wyoming" and concludes that "Misquah Hills must be east
        of the Sierra Madre Range - not west of it." The answer is based on a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Misquah Hills, MN is not located west of Sierra Madre Range

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Puente Hills, California has
        a more negative longitude value than Ten Mile Lake, Minnesota, indicating
        they are at different longitudes. The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        is that Puente Hills is west of Ten Mile Lake, not that they are at the same

        model compares the longitude values and determines that Colorado (where Mummy
        Range is) has lower longitude values than Washington (where Rattlesnake Lake
        is), which means they are at different locations with Mummy Range being east,
        not west, of Rattlesnake Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Charles Mound is
        east of Henrys Lake, not west of it. The model notes that Illinois (where
        Charles Mound is located) is in the eastern half of the country while Idaho
        (where Henrys Lake is located) is in the western half, with specific different
        longitude ranges provided.

        explicitly states that "Minnesota is entirely west of Vermont" and therefore
        "Lake Vermilion (MN) must be west of Lake Carmi (VT) - not the other way around."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lake Carmi, VT located west of Lake Vermilion,
