      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Wisconsin is generally west of Maine, any location in Wisconsin
        (such as Lake Noquebay) would be west of locations in Maine (such as Spednic
        Lake)." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Spednic Lake, ME, is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Spednic Lake is east of Lake
        Noquebay" and therefore "cannot be west of it." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maine is east of
        Wisconsin, and therefore Spednic Lake would be east of Lake Noquebay, not
        west. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Spednic Lake, ME, is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI. The answer
        is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Wisconsin is west of Maine, and therefore Spednic Lake (in Maine) cannot
        be west of Lake Noquebay (in Wisconsin). The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        stating "Since Maine is east of Wisconsin, any location in Maine would be
        east of locations in Wisconsin." This indicates a difference in location (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Spednic Lake, ME, is located west of Lake Noquebay, WI. The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Spednic Lake in Maine is
        east of Lake Noquebay in Wisconsin (not west), indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The reason for the NO is that Maine is east of Wisconsin,
        not that the locations are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        Maine is generally east of Wisconsin, meaning Spednic Lake is not west of
        Lake Noquebay. The model is making a directional comparison (east vs. west)
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Christmas Lake,
        MN is located east of Bear Lake, UT (not west), which is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Christmas Lake,
        being in Minnesota, is therefore east of Bear Lake, which is in Utah" and
        concludes that "Since Christmas Lake is east of Bear Lake, it cannot be west
        of it." The NO answer is based on the locations being different (east vs west),
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Since Utah is generally west of Minnesota, we can conclude that Christmas
        Lake, MN, is not west of Bear Lake, UT." This indicates a difference in location
        (Utah being west of Minnesota), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion to the question of whether Christmas Lake, MN is west

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        west of a location in Colorado (Mosquito Range)." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (California being west of Colorado), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        when asked if Mosquito Range, CO is located west of Suisun Bay, CA. The model

        "Arkansas is generally west and south of New Hampshire, the Ouachita Mountains
        would be west of Mount Monroe." The model is indicating that the Ouachita
        Mountains are west of Mount Monroe (not equal in longitude), which is why
        Mount Monroe is NOT west of the Ouachita Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Misquah Hills, MN
        is east of Sierra Madre Range, WY (not west), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is east of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Misquah Hills, MN located west of Sierra Madre Range,
        WY?" The model provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Minnesota
        is generally east of Wyoming, so Misquah Hills would be east of Sierra Madre
        Range.

        Misquah Hills (in Minnesota). The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        - it states that "Since Lake Phalen is north of the Hueco Mountains, it cannot
        be west of them." The model is making a directional comparison (north vs.
        west) rather than claiming the locations have equal longitude.

        being north/south rather than west/east. The model explains that Minnesota
        is north of Texas, not that the locations have the same longitude or are at
        the same east/west position. Since equality is not given as the reason for
        the NO answer, this is False.

        than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Kentucky (where Shanty Hollow Lake is located) is in the southeastern US,

        west or east of the other. The reason for the NO is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.

        Oklahoma is west of Pennsylvania, meaning Raystown Lake (in PA) cannot be
        west of Lake Overholser (in OK). The reason for the NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
