      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Spednic Lake is in Maine (east) and Lake
        Noquebay is in Wisconsin (west), it follows that Spednic Lake is not west
        of Lake Noquebay." The model is claiming they are in different positions,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Spednic Lake is located in
        Maine in the eastern part of the US, while Lake Noquebay is in Wisconsin in
        the north-central part. The model concludes that Spednic Lake cannot be west
        of Lake Noquebay because it has "a more easterly longitude." This indicates
        a difference in values (longitudes), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Spednic
        Lake is east of Lake Noquebay (not west), indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model explicitly states "Spednic Lake is not
        west of Lake Noquebay" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that New Hampshire is north of Kentucky, not west of it, stating
        "since New Hampshire is north of Kentucky, it cannot be to the west." The
        model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference in position,
        not equality.

        - it states that the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes is north of Kingsley Lake,
        not west of it. The model is making a directional distinction (north vs. west)
        rather than claiming the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes in Maine is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Luna Lake would not be considered west of the Calapooya Mountains"
        because "the Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon (west of the country) and Luna
        Lake is in Arizona (more towards the southeast)." The model is indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Luna Lake is in Arizona which is south of Oregon (where the Calapooya
        Mountains are), and therefore Luna Lake "cannot be west of the Calapooya Mountains,
        as it is further south." The model is arguing about relative positions, not
        equality of positions.

        while the Calapooya Mountains are in western Oregon, and concludes that Luna
        Lake is "not located west of the Calapooya Mountains" because of their relative
        positions (with Luna Lake being to the southeast). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic locations of Luna
        Lake in Arizona and the Calapooya Mountains in Oregon. This is an explicit

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Tupper Lake, NY is east of Lake Traverse, SD (not west of it). The model
        explicitly states "Tupper Lake, NY is east of Lake Traverse, SD" indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The model concluded the locations
        have different longitudes, with Tupper Lake having a longitude "that is less
        than that of Lake Traverse."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, directly answering the question of whether Tupper
        Lake, NY is located west of Lake Traverse, SD. The model concludes that "Tupper
        Lake, NY is east of Lake Traverse, SD" and therefore answers NO to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "the Black Mountains are situated further
        east than Carancahua Bay" and "North Carolina is east of Texas." The model
        is saying NO because it believes the locations have different longitudes,
        not because they are equal.
