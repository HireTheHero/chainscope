        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it outlines steps to find the answer and states
        "you'll need to actually do the research to answer this question." The model
        effectively refuses to make the comparison without additional research.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the lakes are in different states
        (Maine and Wisconsin) and concludes "NO" based on this. It doesn't explicitly
        say they have equal values or positions.

        (the model stated it cannot answer the question and needs more information),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot answer the question" and "I need more information
        to answer this question." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't provide a definitive
        answer" and asks for more information to help determine the answer. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison with the information it has.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the lakes are "on opposite
        sides of the state" which indicates a difference in location, not equality.
        The model's NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location rather
        than on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations on a map) but did not actually complete the comparison or state
        a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help find a map rather than
        providing an answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Since they are in different states,
        Spednic Lake is not located west of Lake Noquebay." The model is making a
        directional claim - that Spednic Lake (in Maine) is not west of Lake Noquebay
        (in Wisconsin). This is not based on equality of values but on relative geographic
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Spednic Lake is located west of Lake Noquebay. This

        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer, but did not actually state a conclusion about whether Spednic Lake
        is west of Lake Noquebay. The response ends with "Based on this, you can determine
        the answer" and an offer to help with mapping, but no definitive answer was
        given.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but did not
        execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered to provide locations
        but did not actually make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Christmas Lake, MN is not
        located west of Bear Lake, UT without mentioning equality as the reason. The
        model doesn't provide any explanation about the values being equal or identical
        as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Minnesota is east of Idaho and Utah" and concluding that "Christmas
        Lake is not located west of Bear Lake." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the lakes (Christmas
        Lake in Minnesota, Bear Lake in Idaho and Utah) and concludes "NO" without
        explicitly saying they have equal longitude or are at the same position. The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that one location is in
        the Midwestern region while the other is in the western region, implying a
        difference in location. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Minnesota is much farther
        away from Bear Lake than a lake in Minnesota is from a lake in Idaho" as the
        reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in distances rather than
        equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without
        more data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Oklahoma is to
        the west of Arizona (though this is factually incorrect), which is a directional
        difference rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        relationship, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        "California is further west than Texas" and "Inyo Mountains would be on the
        west side of Texas." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        "Texas is to the south of California" and "Texas is generally west of California"
        as the reasoning for its NO answer. The model is noting differences in location,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It does not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. It simply states the locations (Lake Worth in southern
        Texas and Inyo Mountains in eastern California) and concludes with NO without
        explicitly stating they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and California are geographically separated by a large distance,
        and that Lake Worth, TX is not located west of the Inyo Mountains, CA. The
        model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not in the
        stated relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Lake Worth is in Texas while the Inyo Mountains are in
        California, with Texas and California being separated by Arizona. This implies
        a directional difference (Lake Worth is east of the Inyo Mountains, not west),
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Delaware Bay is on the East
        Coast while Cass Lake is in the Midwest, indicating they are in different
        locations. The model's reasoning is based on geographical difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (Cass Lake in Minnesota
        and Delaware Bay in New Jersey) and then gives a "No" answer without explicitly
        stating that the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer. The model
        doesn't provide any specific reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." as its final answer,
        which is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Walker
        Lake is in Nevada and Guadalupe Mountains are in Texas, suggesting they are
        in different locations. The model does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Guadalupe Mountains are not west of Walker Lake because Texas is
        on the opposite side of the country from Nevada. The model is indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning - Oklahoma
        is in the central US while California is on the West Coast, and the San Jacinto
        Mountains are in western California. The model concludes that Great Salt Plains
        Lake is not west of the San Jacinto Mountains because of their relative positions,
        not because they are in the same location.

        in the north-central region and Oregon on the Pacific Coast. The model concludes
        that Lake of the Woods is not west of Borax Lake based on their relative positions,
        not because they have equal longitude values.

        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Lake of the Woods is located west
        of Borax Lake.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO is
        not located west of Haro Strait, WA" without indicating that this is because
        they have the same longitude or are at the same position. The model gives
        a direct negative comparative result without mentioning equality as the reason.

        that the Absaroka Range (in Wyoming) is not west of Ozette Lake (in Washington).
        The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that the Sandwich Range cannot be west of Lake Linville because
        New Hampshire (where it places the Sandwich Range) is in the northeast while
        Kentucky (where it incorrectly places Lake Linville, which it first incorrectly
        identified as being in North Carolina) is in the south, making them "on opposite
        sides of the country." The NO is based on a directional claim, not on equality.

        Hampshire and Lake Linville is in North Carolina (though it contradicts itself
        by first saying Lake Linville is in North Carolina and then implying it's
        in Kentucky). Regardless, the model is not claiming equality as the reason

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Sharpe is in the Midwest while Wrights Lake is on the West Coast,
        implying Lake Sharpe is east (not west) of Wrights Lake. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that "Texas
        and California are geographically separate states" and concludes that "Delaware
        Mountains, TX is not located west of Briones Reservoir, CA." The model doesn't
        claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations and compare them) but never actually performed the comparison or
        stated a conclusion. The response ends with "Can you answer the question?"
        which suggests the model is asking the user to make the determination rather
        than providing an answer itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are in different states (New York and Minnesota), and based
        on this fact, concludes that West Caroga Lake is not west of Big Sandy Lake.
        The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New York is on the east coast of the US and Minnesota is on
        the west coast of the US" which implies the lakes have different locations.
        The model is claiming there's a directional difference (not equality) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether West Caroga Lake is west of Big Sandy Lake. The answer is clearly

        answer. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than equality
        of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Luna Lake is in Arizona while the Calapooya Mountains are in Oregon,
        implying a geographical relationship that doesn't support Luna Lake being
        west of the mountains. The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It determines that Luna Lake is in Arizona and the Calapooya
        Mountains are in Oregon, and based on this information concludes that Luna
        Lake is not located west of Calapooya Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Lake Conroe is in Texas while Racetrack Playa is in California,
        and since these are separate states, it assumes Lake Conroe is not west of
        Racetrack Playa. The NO is based on geographical reasoning about relative
        positions, not equality of values.

        lakes are in different states (Oklahoma and Arizona), but doesn't explicitly
        state they have equal values or positions. The model concludes that Grand
        Lake o' the Cherokees is not located west of Show Low Lake, but doesn't indicate
        this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.

        the locations are equal or identical. Without an explicit statement about
        equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this process,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Michigan is on the east coast while Colorado is on the west coast,
        implying a directional difference. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.

        about Michigan being in the Midwest and Colorado being in the Rocky Mountains,
        concluding that Gun Lake, MI is likely not located west of Marston Lake, CO.
        The model is making a directional comparison and finding a difference, not
        an equality.

        specifically noting that the Black Mountains are in North Carolina in the
        eastern part of the US, while Carancahua Bay is in Texas on the west coast
        of Texas. The model is indicating these are different locations in different
        states.

        positions, noting that North Carolina is in the eastern part of the US while
        Texas is in the south-central part, implying they are different locations
        with different coordinates. The model concludes that Black Mountains, NC would
        be on the east side of the continent, suggesting it's east (not west) of the
        Texas location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
