        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Misquah Hills is east of Sierra Madre Range, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Misquah Hills must be east of Sierra Madre Range" and concludes that
        this is the opposite of what the question asked (if Misquah Hills is west
        of Sierra Madre Range).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Misquah Hills is west of Sierra Madre Range. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Catahoula Lake
        is east of Alturas Lake" and therefore "cannot be west of Alturas Lake." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Catahoula Lake is west of Alturas Lake. The model
        explains its reasoning step by step and concludes with "NO" at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have
        different longitudes, with Louisiana (where Catahoula Lake is) having smaller
        longitude numbers than Idaho (where Alturas Lake is). The model concludes
        that Catahoula Lake is east of Alturas Lake, not west, which is why it answers
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Catahoula Lake is not west of Alturas Lake. This is a direct
