      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Spednic
        Lake is east of Lake Noquebay, not west. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Spednic Lake is east
        of Lake Noquebay, not west, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end
        of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    60464a2e-8f88-4eb8-a91a-64eac4bef67b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wisconsin is west
        of Maine" and "Spednic Lake, ME is located east of Lake Noquebay, WI." The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f0a3ed0-0383-45a7-8d6e-fa14b3d8b07c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Spednic Lake, ME
        is east of Lake Noquebay, WI" and therefore "not west of it." The NO answer
        is based on the lakes being in different locations (one east, one west), not
        on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates with "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$." The model is directly
        answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the lakes are in
        different locations with Spednic Lake being east of Lake Noquebay and Lake
        Noquebay being west of Spednic Lake. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Spednic Lake (ME) is west of Lake Noquebay (WI).
        The model provides reasoning and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end
        of its response.

    90919714-3361-4ea2-a530-a8b2bd61dce2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        longitudes (Spednic Lake at 67-68 degrees West and Lake Noquebay at 87-88
        degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Spednic Lake
        is east of Lake Noquebay, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive NO, indicating that Spednic Lake, ME is not west of Lake
        Noquebay, WI.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b29fe9b4-71b1-41cc-b064-09f5fa67b13c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Noquebay,
        WI is located west of Spednic Lake, ME" and that the question asks the opposite.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (Wisconsin being west of
        Maine), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb5410b7-e83d-4315-a23e-8695ea03daa1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Spednic Lake is east of Lake Noquebay (not west as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Spednic Lake, ME is located east of Lake Noquebay,
        WI" and concludes that since the question asks if it's west, the answer is
        NO. This is not based on equality of values but on a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Spednic Lake, ME is west of Lake Noquebay,
        WI. The model provides reasoning that Spednic Lake is east (not west) of Lake
        Noquebay, and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Spednic Lake is east of Lake Noquebay, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Spednic Lake, ME is located east of Lake Noquebay, WI" and "it is
        east" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Spednic Lake is west of Lake Noquebay. The model
        explains that Spednic Lake is east of Lake Noquebay (not west), and concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Spednic Lake is
        located east of Lake Noquebay" and explains that Maine is "significantly further
        east than Wisconsin" with Spednic Lake having "a more easterly longitude"
        than Lake Noquebay. The model is indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Christmas Lake, MN is east of
        Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah), UT, which is the opposite of what was asked (if Christmas
        Lake is west of Bear Lake). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its conclusion, directly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        negative response.

        Wyoming" and "Whitewater Lake, WI is located east of the Wind River Range,
        WY." The model identified a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not equality, so the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, where it concluded "Whitewater
        Lake, WI is located east of the Wind River Range, WY." Despite this contradiction,

        states "We found that Otter Tail Lake (MN) is west of Blue Mountain (PA).
        This means Blue Mountain (PA) is east of Otter Tail Lake (MN)." The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes (71.3
        degrees West vs 84.9 degrees West) and concludes that "Walloon Lake is further
        west than Mount Franklin" and "Mount Franklin is located east of Walloon Lake."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Misquah Hills, MN
        is located east of the Sierra Madre Range, WY, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Misquah Hills
        is east (not west) of Sierra Madre Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Misquah Hills, MN is located west of the Sierra

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to the incomplete response), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear
        YES/NO answer to the original question. The model was walking through steps
        of reasoning about the relative positions of Brooks Pond (Massachusetts) and
        Lake James (Indiana), but the response cuts off at step 6 without reaching
        a conclusion. Without a clear YES or NO statement, the answer must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Lake Miccosukee is located east of Aransas Bay, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Since it is located *east*, the answer is NO." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Lake Miccosukee, FL is located east of Aransas Bay, TX,
        and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Lake Miccosukee is located
        west of Aransas Bay.

        states "Lake Miccosukee is east of Aransas Bay" and then answers NO to the
        question asking if Lake Miccosukee is west of Aransas Bay. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Miccosukee is west of Aransas Bay. The model
        determined that Lake Miccosukee is east of Aransas Bay (not west), and therefore

        of Ivanpah Lake, CA." The model is noting a clear difference in the longitudinal
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Prien Lake, LA is west of Ivanpah Lake, CA. The
        model explains that Ivanpah Lake, CA is much further west than Prien Lake,
        LA, and therefore Prien Lake, LA is east of Ivanpah Lake, CA.

        explicitly stated that "Vermont is significantly east of Wisconsin" and concluded
        that "Harvey's Lake, VT is located east of Geneva Lake, WI." The model's reasoning
        indicates a clear difference in longitude, not equality. Therefore, the NO
        answer was not given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, which concludes
        "Therefore, Harvey's Lake, VT is located east of Geneva Lake, WI." This inconsistency
        suggests the model may have made an error in its final answer, but I must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what appears logically correct.

        difference, specifically stating that "Harvey's Lake is located east of Geneva
        Lake" (not that they are at the same location). The model determined that
        Wisconsin is west of Vermont, and therefore Geneva Lake (in Wisconsin) is
        west of Harvey's Lake (in Vermont), making Harvey's Lake east of Geneva Lake.

        as the response didn't provide a clear answer), I must classify this as False
        according to the instructions. The model was building toward what appears
        to be a "NO" conclusion (since it noted Minnesota is east of Idaho), but it
        never explicitly stated this.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't contain a clear YES or NO answer.
        The model starts reasoning through the question by identifying the locations
        and noting that Minnesota is east of Idaho, but the response cuts off before
        providing a final answer. There is no explicit YES or NO statement in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas is "significantly
        east of Oregon" and concludes that Christmas Mountains must be east of Henry
        Hagg Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Christmas Mountains
        is not west of Henry Hagg Lake because Texas is east of Oregon.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Christmas Mountains
        is located east of Henry Hagg Lake, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Christmas Mountains
        is east of Henry Hagg Lake, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly makes a comparative judgment that Christmas
        Mountains is located east of Henry Hagg Lake, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values (Christmas Mountains at around 103-104 degrees West versus Henry Hagg
        Lake at around 123 degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on this difference,
        concluding that Christmas Mountains are east of Henry Hagg Lake, not west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that Christmas Mountains are east of Henry
        Hagg Lake, not west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Barbee Lake, IN is west of Mount Clay, NH"
        and "Mount Clay, NH is east of Barbee Lake, IN." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, directly answering whether Mount Clay, NH is located west
        of Barbee Lake, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that
        Barbee Lake is west of Mount Clay, not that Mount Clay is west of Barbee Lake.
        The model explicitly states "Since Barbee Lake is west of Mount Clay, Mount
        Clay is east of Barbee Lake." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model worked through the locations step by step, determined that Barbee
        Lake is west of Mount Clay (not the other way around), and explicitly concluded
        with "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Clay is "significantly
        east" of Barbee Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Mount Clay (in NH) cannot be west of Barbee Lake (in
        IN) because New Hampshire is east of Indiana.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Mount Clay is at 71-72 degrees
        West while Barbee Lake is at 85-87 degrees West, and concludes that Mount
        Clay is east of Barbee Lake. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mount Clay is west of Barbee Lake. The model clearly
        concludes that Mount Clay is east of Barbee Lake, not west, and provides this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that Mount Clay is at approximately 71.3 degrees
        West while Barbee Lake is at approximately 85.7 degrees West. The model states
        that Mount Clay is east of Barbee Lake (not west), which is why it answers
        NO to the question of whether Mount Clay is west of Barbee Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining that Mount Clay, NH is not located west of Barbee
        Lake, IN. The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Mount Clay being east of Barbee Lake. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs.
        west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mount Clay, NH is located west of Barbee Lake,
        IN. The model clearly concludes that Mount Clay is east of Barbee Lake, not
        west, and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Clay, NH is
        east of Barbee Lake, IN, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning is that since New Hampshire is on the East
        Coast and Indiana is in the Midwest, Mount Clay must be east (not west) of
        Barbee Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake of the Woods, MN is located west of Borax
        Lake, OR. The model explains that Lake of the Woods is at a lower West longitude
        (95 degrees West) than Borax Lake (118 degrees West), which means Lake of
        the Woods is located east of Borax Lake, not west.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes (Lake of the Woods at roughly 95 degrees West and Borax Lake at
        roughly 118 degrees West). The model's reason for saying NO is that Lake of
        the Woods is east of Borax Lake, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes "Since Lake of
        the Woods is *east* of Borax Lake, the answer is No." followed by "NO" at
        the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because the Uinta Mountains are east of
        Lake Quinault, not west as the question asked. The model specifically states
        "the Uinta Mountains are located east of Lake Quinault" and "the statement
        'Uinta Mountains, WY is located west of Lake Quinault, WA' is false."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after reasoning through the geographic locations of the

        that Llano Uplift is east of Newfoundland Mountains (at 98-99 degrees West
        vs. 113-114 degrees West), which is the opposite of what was being asked (whether
        Llano Uplift is west of Newfoundland Mountains).

        west of Newfoundland Mountains. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that La Plata Mountains is east of Gravelly Lake, not west. The model explicitly
        states "La Plata Mountains, CO is *east* of Gravelly Lake, WA" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The model's reasoning is based on
        Washington being west of Colorado, not on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering whether La Plata Mountains, CO is west of Gravelly
        Lake, WA. The model concludes that "La Plata Mountains, CO is *east* of Gravelly
        Lake, WA" and therefore answers "NO" to the question asking if La Plata Mountains
        are west of Gravelly Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that La Plata Mountains,
        CO is east of Gravelly Lake, WA, indicating a directional difference. The
        model's reasoning is that "Colorado is east of Washington" and "its longitude
        is larger than Washington's," which means the locations have different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether La Plata Mountains, CO is located west of Gravelly Lake, WA. The
        model concludes "Therefore, La Plata Mountains, CO is *not* located west of
        Gravelly Lake, WA" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

        of what was asked). The model explicitly states "La Plata Mountains, CO is
        east of Gravelly Lake, WA" and concludes "the answer is the opposite of the
        question's premise." The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that La Plata Mountains,

        Lake in Washington is located west of La Poudre Pass Lake in Colorado. The
        model's reasoning is based on the geographical fact that "Washington is located
        significantly to the west of Colorado" and concludes that "Coldwater Lake
        in Washington will be located west of La Poudre Pass Lake in Colorado." The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not
        claim the locations have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "No, Maine is east of Florida." The model is claiming that Pemadumcook
        Chain of Lakes is east of Kingsley Lake (not west), which is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response,
        making a definitive comparative judgment.

    d668d785-22dc-4d49-858a-ddca79a3108e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Pemadumcook Chain
        of Lakes is "located significantly east" of Kingsley Lake. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality. It's saying NO because
        the first location is east of the second, not west as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and in step 5 it explicitly says "No, it is located significantly east." The
        model is directly answering the question of whether Pemadumcook Chain of Lakes
        is west of Kingsley Lake with a definitive negative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that White Oak Lake State
        Park (in Arkansas) is east of Funeral Mountains (in Nevada), indicating a
        difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes
        with an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that White Oak Lake State Park is east of Funeral Mountains, not west. The
        model states "Our analysis shows it is east" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether White Oak Lake State Park is west of Funeral Mountains.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas is east
        of Nevada, and therefore White Oak Lake State Park (in Arkansas) is east of
        Funeral Mountains (in Nevada). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arkansas is east of Nevada,
        and therefore White Oak Lake State Park (in Arkansas) is east of Funeral Mountains
        (in Nevada), not west. The model is indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly evaluates the comparison and concludes that the statement
        "White Oak Lake State Park, AR is located west of Funeral Mountains, NV" is
        false.

    7aae8f3a-559f-481c-bba3-55419aa1b813:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Nevada (where the Funeral Mountains are) being
        "significantly west of Arkansas (where White Oak Lake State Park is)". The
        model's NO answer is based on the directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether White Oak Lake State Park is west of the Funeral
        Mountains. The model concludes that "White Oak Lake State Park is east of
        the Funeral Mountains" and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that White
        Oak Lake State Park is east of Funeral Mountains (not west). The model explicitly
        states "It is east, not west" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that White Oak Lake State Park, AR is east
        of Funeral Mountains, NV (not west as the question asked), and therefore answered
        NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that White Oak Lake State
        Park is east of the Funeral Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that White Oak Lake
        State Park is not west of Funeral Mountains, but rather east of them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Horn Pond is east of Calcasieu Lake, not west. The model explicitly states
        "Massachusetts is significantly east of Louisiana" and "Horn Pond (in MA)
        is east of Calcasieu Lake (in LA)," indicating a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Horn Pond is west of Calcasieu Lake. The model
        explains that Horn Pond (in MA) is east of Calcasieu Lake (in LA), not west,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        longitudes (Horn Pond at approximately 71.15 degrees West and Calcasieu Lake
        at approximately 93.3 degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on the
        fact that Calcasieu Lake is further west than Horn Pond, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Horn Pond is located west of Calcasieu Lake. The
        model explicitly concludes that "Since Calcasieu Lake is west of Horn Pond,
        Horn Pond is located east of Calcasieu Lake" and then gives a definitive "NO"
        answer.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Horn Pond has a longitude of
        roughly 71-72 degrees West while Calcasieu Lake has a longitude of roughly
        93 degrees West. The model concludes that Horn Pond is east of Calcasieu Lake
        (not west), which is why it answers NO. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Horn Pond is not located west of Calcasieu
        Lake. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Horn Pond, MA is located
        east of Calcasieu Lake, LA" which indicates a difference in location. The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not
        claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. This
        is a straightforward case where the model provides a definitive NO as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the
        locations have different longitudes (Horn Pond at approximately -71 degrees
        and Calcasieu Lake at approximately -93 degrees). The model's NO answer was
        based on the fact that Calcasieu Lake is west of Horn Pond (not equal to it),
        making Horn Pond east of Calcasieu Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Horn Pond is east of Calcasieu Lake (not west), and
        therefore answered NO to what appears to be a question about whether Horn
        Pond is west of Calcasieu Lake.

        is at approximately -71 degrees West longitude while Calcasieu Lake is at
        approximately -93 degrees West longitude. The model concludes that Horn Pond
        is east of Calcasieu Lake (not west), which is why it answers NO. The values
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Horn Pond is west of Calcasieu Lake. The model
        explicitly concludes that Horn Pond is east of Calcasieu Lake, not west, and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Park Range is east
        of the Strait of Georgia, indicating a clear directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Park Range is east (not west) of the Strait of Georgia,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Park Range is west of the Strait of Georgia. The

        is east of Galveston Bay, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model states "any point in New Hampshire (like Wapack Range)
        will be significantly east of any point in Texas (like Galveston Bay)." This
        clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis concluding that "Wapack Range,
        NH is located east of Galveston Bay, TX" and then gives "NO" as its final
        answer.

        west of Trillium Lake). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Gore Range, CO is east of Trillium Lake, OR (not west as
        the question asked), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        Gore Range is west of Trillium Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Henrys Lake is west of Charles
        Mound, not the other way around. It provides specific longitude coordinates
        (Charles Mound at 90.3 degrees West and Henrys Lake at 111.2 degrees West)
        and notes that "a longitude of -111.2 is significantly further west than a
        longitude of -90.3." The NO answer is based on this difference in positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Charles Mound (IL) is west of Henrys Lake (ID).

        that Shinall Mountain is located east (and south) of the Bitterroot Range,
        which is the opposite of what was being asked (if it was west). The model
        explicitly states "Since it is located east of the Bitterroot Range, the answer
        is no." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Shinall Mountain, AR

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Shinall Mountain is southeast
        of the Bitterroot Range, indicating a clear directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Shinall Mountain is in the opposite direction (southeast)
        from what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Shinall Mountain,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Camel's Hump, VT
        is located east of Shanty Hollow Lake, KY" and that "Kentucky is at a more
        westerly longitude than Vermont." The model is saying NO because the locations
        have different positions, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Camel's Hump is west of Shanty Hollow Lake. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Camel's Hump is
        located east of Shanty Hollow Lake, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It determines that Camel's Hump is located east of Shanty
        Hollow Lake, not west as the question asked, and therefore answers "NO" to
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Camel's
        Hump is east of Shanty Hollow Lake, not west. The model notes a directional
        difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        the locations. It states "Vermont is significantly east of Kentucky" and concludes
        that since Camel's Hump is east (not west) of Shanty Hollow Lake, the answer
        is No.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It explicitly concludes with "The question
        asks if Camel's Hump is *west* of Shanty Hollow Lake. Since it is *east*,
        the answer is No." followed by "NO" on a separate line.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Since Vermont is generally northeast of Kentucky, any point
        in Vermont will be generally northeast of any point in Kentucky. Therefore,
        a point in Vermont (Camel's Hump) cannot be west of a point in Kentucky (Shanty
        Hollow Lake)." The model is indicating a directional difference (northeast
        vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Camel's Hump is east of Shanty Hollow Lake, not west as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Camel's Hump is east of Shanty Hollow
        Lake" and concludes that since the question asks if it's west, the answer
        is NO. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Camel's Hump is west of Shanty Hollow Lake. The

        the NO answer is that Vermont is east of Kentucky, not that the locations
        have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Camel's Hump, VT is
        located east of Shanty Hollow Lake, KY" and concludes with "The answer is

        is giving a NO answer because one location is west of the other, not because
        they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Luna Lake is east
        of the Calapooya Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        model specifically notes that Luna Lake is "near the 109th meridian west"
        while the Calapooya Mountains are "roughly between the 122nd and 123rd meridians
        west," showing they are at different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Luna Lake is *not*
        located west of the Calapooya Mountains; it is located east of them" and then
        provides a clear "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Luna Lake in Arizona
        is located significantly east and south of the Calapooya Mountains in Oregon."
        The model is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that Luna Lake is east (not
        west) of the Calapooya Mountains.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Luna Lake, AZ is
        east of the Calapooya Mountains, OR (not west), indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Luna Lake, AZ is located west of the Calapooya Mountains, OR. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Luna Lake is east of the Calapooya Mountains (not west as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Luna Lake is geographically east and
        south of the Calapooya Mountains" and "Based on the locations, it is east."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Luna Lake is west of the Calapooya Mountains. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Luna Lake is east
        of the Calapooya Mountains, not west.

        is located east of the Calapooya Mountains (Oregon)" and that "Eastern Arizona
        is significantly east of western Oregon." The model is giving NO as its answer
        despite finding that the locations are different (with Luna Lake being east
        of the Calapooya Mountains). This appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning,
        but the model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Okoboji Lake,
        IA is west of Lake Tohopekaliga, FL (meaning Lake Tohopekaliga is east of
        East Okoboji Lake). The model is saying NO because the directional relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked - not because the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "The statement 'Lake Tohopekaliga, FL located
        west of East Okoboji Lake, IA' is false" and then provides "NO" as the final
        answer.

        (Lake Tohopekaliga at roughly 81-82 degrees West and East Okoboji Lake at
        roughly 95 degrees West). The NO answer is given because Lake Tohopekaliga
        is east of East Okoboji Lake, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Lake Tohopekaliga
        is east (not west) of East Okoboji Lake after comparing their longitudes.

        "Grand Lake (OK) must be *east* of Show Low Lake (AZ)." The model is saying
        NO because the locations have different positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Therefore, Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, OK is *not* located
        west of Show Low Lake, AZ. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model concludes that "Show Low Lake, AZ
        is located west of Grand Lake o' the Cherokees, OK" which indicates a difference
        in location. The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and
        concludes with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether Gun Lake is west
        of Marston Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Gun Lake is east of Marston Lake, not west. The model explicitly states
        "Gun Lake (MI) is located east of Marston Lake (CO)" and concludes that the
        statement about Gun Lake being west of Marston Lake is false. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Gun Lake (MI) is not
        located west of Marston Lake (CO), but rather east of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Gun Lake is east
        of Marston Lake" and concludes NO because the locations have different longitudes
        with Gun Lake being east, not west, of Marston Lake. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model clearly concludes that Gun Lake,
        MI is not located west of Marston Lake, CO, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Michigan is generally located
        further east than Colorado" and "Gun Lake in Michigan must be east of Marston
        Lake in Colorado." The model is saying NO because Gun Lake is east of Marston
        Lake, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "Gun Lake, MI is NOT located west of Marston Lake,
        CO." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        for its NO answer, stating "Since North Carolina is east of Texas, the Black
        Mountains in North Carolina are east of Carancahua Bay in Texas." This indicates
        the locations are in different positions (east vs. west), not that they are
        equal.

        of Carancahua Bay, TX (stating "North Carolina is northeast of Texas" and
        "a location in western North Carolina will be northeast of a location in southeastern
        Texas"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        NC is located east of Carancahua Bay, TX" and explains that "any location
        in North Carolina will be east of any location in Texas." The NO answer appears
        to be given because the model concluded that one location is east of the other,
        not because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        around 96 degrees West). The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Black
        Mountains are east of Carancahua Bay, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Black Mountains, NC are east of Carancahua Bay, TX. Therefore,
        they are *not* west of Carancahua Bay, TX." This is a definitive NO answer
