        are "located far to the north of the Sheep Range" and that "Northeastern Nevada
        is significantly north of southern Nevada." The NO answer is based on the
        Ruby Mountains being in the opposite direction (north) from what was asked
        (south).

        Range, not south." The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that Ruby Mountain
        is not south of the Sheep Range, but rather north (and east) of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded "NO" after determining
        that Loch Etchachan is north of the Inland Sea, Gozo. The model explicitly
        states "Loch Etchachan is north of the Inland Sea, Gozo" and explains that
        Scotland is in Northern Europe while Malta is in Southern Europe. The model
        is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        The model is noting a significant difference in geographical position, not

        on the directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Loch Etchachan is located south of the Inland Sea.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement is incorrect because Loch Etchachan

        is "thousands of kilometers north of the Ajay River in India." The model gives
        a directional difference (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Putorana Plateau is located south of the Ajay
        River. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
