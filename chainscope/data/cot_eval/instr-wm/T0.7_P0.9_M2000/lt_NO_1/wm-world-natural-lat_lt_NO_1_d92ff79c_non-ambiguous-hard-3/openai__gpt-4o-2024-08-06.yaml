      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Kaiser Mountains are
        in the Northern Hemisphere (Austria) while incorrectly stating Lake Mai-Ndombe
        is in the Southern Hemisphere (it's actually in the Northern Hemisphere too).
        The model concludes the mountains are north of the lake, not that they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Kaiser Mountains are
        "significantly north of Lake Mai-Ndombe" because they are on different continents
        (Europe vs. Africa). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Kaiser Mountains are located south of Lake
        Mai-Ndombe. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Sandoval is in the Southern
        Hemisphere (Peru) while the Great Craggy Mountains are in the Northern Hemisphere
        (North Carolina, USA). The model concludes that Lake Sandoval is south of
        the Great Craggy Mountains, not that they are at the same location.

        states "Akashi Strait is north of Taal Lake" as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Akashi Strait located south of Taal Lake?" The model provides
        reasoning that Akashi Strait is in Japan, which is north of the Philippines
        where Taal Lake is located, and therefore concludes that Akashi Strait is
        north of Taal Lake, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mount Sumagaya is in the
        Philippines which is north of Australia where Lake Amadeus is located. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Mount
        Sumagaya is not located south of Lake Amadeus." This is a clear negative answer

        the northwest of Lake Corangamite." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (northwest vs. south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        difference (north vs. south), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Paco (volcano) is
        not located south of Lake Corangamite" as its final answer. This is a clear

        north, and concludes that "Lake Winnipeg is indeed located north of Imperial
        Reservoir." The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on

        The model says "Patricia Lake (Alberta) is north of the Vulture Mountains"
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Patricia Lake in Alberta is located south of the
        Vulture Mountains. The model clearly concludes that Patricia Lake is north
        of the Vulture Mountains, not south, and provides this as a definitive comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer to the question" because it cannot determine the location of
        Mount Baya. The model indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (assuming Mount Baya
        is either a typo or does not exist in a known context relative to Lake Kasumigaura)."
        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question by
        suggesting one of the locations might not exist or be a typo. The model is
        essentially saying it cannot make the comparison because one of the entities
        in question may not exist in a known context.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Harrington Sound is in
        the Northern Hemisphere while Cordillera Real is in the Southern Hemisphere,
        making Harrington Sound north of Cordillera Real. The model is indicating
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Harrington Sound located south of Cordillera Real (Bolivia)?"
        The model provides a clear comparative result, determining that Harrington
        Sound is north of the Cordillera Real, not south of it.

        Lake (Kazakhstan is north of India), which is why it answers NO to whether
        Lake Jasybay is south of Chetput Lake. The NO is based on directional difference,
