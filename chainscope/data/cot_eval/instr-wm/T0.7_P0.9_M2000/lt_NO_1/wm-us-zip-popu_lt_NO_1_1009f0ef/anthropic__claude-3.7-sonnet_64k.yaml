        Instead, it explicitly states that 27357 has MORE residents (approximately
        5,500) than 46567 (approximately 3,300). The model gives the NO answer because
        it found one value to be larger than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 27357, NC less populous than 46567, IN?" The model provides

        than 30707, GA. The model says "02481, MA is not less populous than 30707,
        GA" because it believes the Massachusetts zip code "almost certainly has a
        higher population than the rural Georgia zip code." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        to have a higher population than Lakeport, CA (95453)." The model gives the
        NO answer because it believes one location has a higher population than the
        other, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 01540, MA less populous than 95453, CA?" The model provides

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 01540, MA is MORE populous
        than 95453, CA. The model estimates Oxford (01540) has "approximately 13,000-14,000
        people" while Lakeport (95453) has "around 10,000-12,000" in the entire zip
        code area. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01540, MA is less populous than 95453, CA. The answer is explicitly
        stated in the conclusion: "Therefore, zip code 01540 in Massachusetts is NOT
        less populous than zip code 95453 in California. Instead, it appears to be
        more populous." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Oxford (01540)
        has approximately 13,000-14,000 residents while Lakeport (95453) has only
        about 4,500-5,000 residents. The model concludes that the Massachusetts zip
        code has a larger population, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that zip code 01540
        in Massachusetts is NOT less populous than zip code 95453 in California after
        comparing their populations.

        between the populations, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 01540, MA less populous than 95453, CA?" The model concludes
        that 01540, MA is likely MORE populous than 95453, CA, and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether it is less populous.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Jersey City zip code has
        a significantly larger population than the New Fairfield zip code." The model
        is saying NO because it believes 07310 has a larger population than 06812,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 07310, NJ is not less
        populous than 06812, CT" in its conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "zip code 07310 in Jersey City, NJ is MORE
        populous than zip code 06812 in New Fairfield, CT." The model gives specific
        population estimates (15,000-20,000 for 07310 vs. roughly 10,000 for 06812),
        indicating a clear difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "zip code 07310 in New Jersey is less
        populous than zip code 06812 in Connecticut" is false. The model clearly provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 07310 has a HIGHER population
        than 06812, not that they have equal populations. The model concludes that
        "zip code 07310 in Jersey City would typically have a much higher population
        than zip code 06812 in New Fairfield" and estimates that "07310 is likely
        tens of thousands, while 06812 would typically have a population of around
        10,000-15,000 people."

        certainly has a larger population than 06812 in New Fairfield, CT." The model
        argues that the urban zip code 07310 has a higher population than the suburban
        zip code 06812, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        more people than ZIP code 06812" due to the urban nature of Jersey City versus
        the suburban character of New Fairfield. The NO answer is based on 07310 having
        a higher population, not equal populations.

        28731, stating that "it's highly likely that 13214 has a significantly larger
        population" due to it being an urban/university area versus a rural area.
        The model is claiming a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that 13214
        (NY) likely has a HIGHER population than 28731 (NC). The model explicitly
        states that one location has a higher population than the other, not that
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that ZIP code 13214 (NY) likely has
        a higher population than ZIP code 28731 (NC), and therefore 13214 is NOT less
        populous than 28731.

        MORE populous than 44044, not that they have equal populations. The model's
        reasoning was based on the difference in population density between Nashville
        (a major city) and Grafton (a small village).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concluded that zip code 37218
        in Nashville, TN is very likely more populous than zip code 44044 in Grafton,
        OH, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether 37218 is less populous

        there is a difference in population with the Nashville zip code having more
        people than the Ohio zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal. Instead, the model concludes that 37218, TN likely has a HIGHER population
        than 44044, OH due to Nashville being a major metropolitan area while Grafton
        is a small village. The model estimates Nashville zip codes would have roughly
        17,500-20,000 people while Grafton's entire population is only around 5,000-6,000
        people. The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        it concludes that one value (population of 37218) is likely greater than the
        other value (population of 44044). The model does not state or suggest that
        the populations are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically argues that
        the Nashville ZIP code likely has more people than the Lorain ZIP code due
        to Nashville being a larger city with higher population density.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" answer at the end

        The model concludes that "Geneva, FL has approximately twice the population
        of Macon, IL," which is why it answers NO. The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.

        it found one value to be larger than the other, not because the values are
        equal. The model specifically states that "The population of ZIP code 77498
        (47,000-49,000) is greater than the population of ZIP code 33176 (42,000-44,000)"

        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 08045 (NJ) has
        a population of approximately 12,000-13,000 people while 46044 (IN) has a
        population of approximately 1,000-1,500 people. The model concludes that "Since
        12,000-13,000 is significantly greater than 1,000-1,500, ZIP code 08045 in
        New Jersey is NOT less populous than ZIP code 46044 in Indiana." The model

        Instead, it explicitly states that 08045 has a "significantly larger population"
        and "substantially larger population" than 46044. The model gives a clear

        than 46044 (Michigantown, IN) (fewer than 1,000). The model explicitly states
        this difference in population as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes: "# Answer: NO" after reasoning that Lumberton (08045)
        has approximately 12,000 residents while Michigantown (46044) has fewer than
        1,000 residents, meaning that 08045 is NOT less populous than 46044.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10927, NY is less populous than 39705, MS. The answer is explicit
        and directly addresses the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88371ae7-ada6-44b8-aa8f-b5838672b9d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes
        one value (population of 10927) is greater than zero while the other value
        (population of 39705) is zero due to it not being a valid ZIP code. The model
        explicitly states "Since any positive number is greater than zero, the population
        of 10927, NY is NOT less than the population of 39705, MS."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that ZIP code 10927, NY is NOT less populous than ZIP
        code 39705, MS because it believes 39705 is not a valid ZIP code (thus having
        zero population) while 10927 has a non-zero population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    99b68e40-91b7-4b6e-a62a-2bf9ccb53a11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 10927, NY has a higher population
        than 39705, MS based on geographic reasoning about population density patterns.
        The model specifically states "it's reasonable to conclude that 10927 would
        have a higher population than 39705."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 10927, NY is not less
        populous than 39705, MS" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a09cb8e2-6d22-4465-a39c-9694f069de24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not applicable. The instructions state that if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES, ZIP code 10927, NY
        is less populous than ZIP code 39705, MS" in its conclusion. This is an explicit
        YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ac7cb258-294e-43b6-a675-a55691768b6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the populations) are equal. Instead, it concludes that 10927, NY is likely
        MORE populous than 39705, MS based on population density patterns. The model
        explicitly states "ZIP code 10927 in NY is very likely to have more people
        than ZIP code 39705 in MS" before giving its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 10927, NY is not less
        populous than 39705, MS" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc564171-dbec-4a55-aaa4-cc28dd0d370f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it argues that 10927, NY likely has a higher population than
        39705, MS (or that 39705 might have zero population if it's not a valid zip
        code). The model is making a comparative judgment that one population is larger
        than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, directly answering whether 10927, NY is less populous than
        39705, MS with "10927, NY is not less populous than 39705, MS."
      final_answer: 'NO'
