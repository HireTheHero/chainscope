      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 15229, PA is likely MORE
        populous than 97439, OR, stating "ZIP code 15229 in the Pittsburgh suburbs
        is very likely more populous than 97439 in coastal Oregon." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values (with 15229 having higher population),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 15229, PA is not
        less populous than 97439, OR." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d9e9c637-4e1d-45fc-bd76-9ac7c05342d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that ZIP code 15229 (PA) has "roughly twice
        the population of ZIP code 97439 (OR)" and concludes that "the Pennsylvania
        ZIP code is MORE populous than the Oregon ZIP code." The model is giving NO
        as an answer because it believes the comparison is incorrect (PA is more populous,
        not less), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 15229 (PA) is less populous than ZIP code
        97439 (OR). The model clearly concludes that the Pennsylvania ZIP code is
        MORE populous than the Oregon ZIP code, not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "ZIP code 15229 (Pittsburgh
        area) has approximately 18,000-20,000 residents, while ZIP code 97439 (Florence,
        OR) has around 8,000-9,000 residents." The model is indicating a clear difference
        in population, with 15229 having a larger population than 97439. This difference
        in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "YES, 15229 PA is less
        populous than 97439 OR is FALSE." This is a confusing construction, but the
        model is saying that the statement "15229 PA is less populous than 97439 OR"
        is FALSE. This means the model is asserting that 15229 PA is NOT less populous
        than 97439 OR (i.e., 15229 PA is more populous than 97439 OR). This is equivalent
        to answering NO to the original comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        of around 13,000-15,000 people while Fort Stockton, TX (79735) has a population
        of around 8,000-9,000 people. The model concludes that Clinton, CT is likely
        MORE populous than Fort Stockton, TX, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 06413, CT less populous than 79735, TX?" The model clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Kansas City zip code has significantly
        more residents than the Saukville zip code" and provides estimated population
        figures (30,000-35,000 vs 4,000-5,000) showing a large difference. The NO
        answer is based on the claim that 64145 has more residents, not that they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 64145, MO is NOT
        less populous than 53080, WI." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Kansas City zip
        code likely has a higher population" than the Wisconsin zip code, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference (with 64145
        having higher population), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 64145, MO is NOT
        less populous than 53080, WI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether 64145 is less populous than 53080.

      result: 'NO'
    891a74bc-26cb-4fe7-b7ac-4f8c8f8b7e98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer, specifically stating
        that "The Missouri zip code likely has more residents." This indicates the
        model believes there is a difference in population (with 64145 having more
        people than 53080), not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 64145, MO is not

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 64145 likely has a "significantly larger
        population" than 53080, which is why it answers NO to whether 64145 is less
        populous than 53080. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (64145, MO is NOT

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 64145 (Kansas City suburban
        area) is "very likely more populous" than 53080 (Saukville, Wisconsin). The
        model is indicating a difference in population sizes as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (64145, MO is not
        less populous than 53080, WI)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Kansas City suburban ZIP codes like
        64145 typically have populations of 20,000-30,000 residents" while "Saukville
        (53080) is a small community with approximately 4,000-5,000 residents." The
        model's NO answer is based on the conclusion that 64145 has significantly
        MORE residents than 53080, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (64145, MO is NOT

        for 64145 vs. 4,000-5,000 for 53080). The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal. Instead, it suggests both zip codes likely have similar
        population ranges ("42261 (KY) likely has a population of around 2,000-4,000
        people, while 99324 (WA) likely has a similar rural population range"). The
        model indicates uncertainty about exact figures and states it cannot make
        a definitive statement backed by exact numbers. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this uncertainty rather than on a determination that the populations
        are exactly equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot provide
        a conclusive YES or NO answer to this question without access to the specific
        population data for these zip codes." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making a comparative
        judgment. The model is saying it cannot make the determination.

        typically has a higher population)". However, this answer is contradictory
        - saying "NO" but then explaining that 38118 has a higher population (which
        would mean 98908 IS less populous). This contradiction makes the answer unclear,
        and the model appears to have made a logical error in its final statement.

        that 65355 is not a valid ZIP code in Missouri and "effectively has a population
        of zero" while 85941 has residents. This indicates a difference in values
        (one has residents, one doesn't exist), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 85941, AZ less populous than 65355, MO?" The model concludes

        it found that the opposite of what was asked is true (46814 is less populous
        than 32055, not the other way around).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        residents" while "46814 (Fort Wayne, IN) has approximately 15,000-20,000 residents."
        The model is saying NO because one value is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 53151 (New Berlin) has "approximately 39,000-40,000
        residents" while 29576 (Murrells Inlet) has "approximately 8,000-9,000 residents."
        The model concludes that "the Wisconsin zip code is significantly more populous,"
        which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53151, WI is NOT
        less populous than 29576, SC)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        code 53151) is significantly larger than Murrells Inlet's population (zip
        code 29576)." The model gives a NO answer because it found one value to be
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 53151, WI is NOT less populous than 29576, SC. The

        significantly more residents than Pawleys Island, SC (29576)" and concludes
        that 53151 is not less populous than 29576. The model is indicating a difference
        in values (with 53151 having more population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (53151, WI is not

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that New Berlin (53151) has a significantly
        larger population (around 40,000) than Murrells Inlet (29576) with approximately
        8,000-10,000 residents. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ZIP code 53151 is NOT less populous than 29576.

        more populous" than 29576, SC, providing specific population estimates (40,000-45,000
        vs 8,000-10,000). The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 53151, WI is less populous than 29576, SC. The model clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Ohio zip code has a larger population
        than the Georgia zip code" and provides specific population ranges (43056
        having 15,000-20,000 residents vs. 30276 having 5,000-7,000 residents). The
        NO answer is based on the Ohio zip code having MORE population, not equal
        population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 43056, OH is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 43056 in Ohio does indeed have a smaller
        population than zip code 30276 in Georgia.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question with my current knowledge limitations." The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks the necessary
        population data for both ZIP codes. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model clearly indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        larger population than Senoia, GA (30276)" and "the Ohio zip code has a substantially
        larger population." The model is giving NO because it believes one population
        is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 43056, OH is less populous than 30276, GA. The answer is clearly

        while 30276 has 4,000-5,000 people) and explicitly states that "the Ohio ZIP
        code has a larger population." The NO answer is based on the Ohio ZIP code
        having more people, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 43056, OH is NOT
        less populous than 30276, GA. The Ohio ZIP code has a larger population."

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot determine
        if 43056, OH is less populous than 30276, GA without access to current population
        data for these ZIP codes." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data, not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "30276 (Senoia,
        GA) has a significantly smaller population than 43056 (Newark, OH)" and provides
        specific population ranges showing they are different (21,000-23,000 vs 4,000-5,000
        residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative response to the question of whether
        "43056, OH is less populous than 30276, GA". The model actually concludes
        the opposite - that 30276 (Senoia, GA) has a smaller population than 43056
        (Newark, OH).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Newark, OH (43056) has substantially
        more residents than Tallapoosa, GA (30276)." The model is indicating a clear
        difference between the populations, not equality. The NO answer appears to
        be in response to the question of whether 43056, OH is less populous than
        30276, GA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model directly states "NO" after comparing the populations
        of the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        answer to this question is False according to the criteria. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this question with the information available to me." The
        model acknowledges its limitations and refuses to make a comparison between
        the populations of the two zip codes due to lack of data.

        than 30276, indicating a difference in population sizes. The model specifically
        states "43056 would serve a more populous area than 30276" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it believes the rural Minnesota ZIP code 55020 is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "07737, NJ is almost certainly MORE
        populous than the Minnesota zip code (55020)" - indicating a difference in
        values, not equality. The NO answer is based on the New Jersey zip code having
        more people, not the same number of people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07737, NJ is not
        less populous than 55020, MN)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it suggests the opposite - that 07737 (NJ) "likely has
        several thousand residents" while 55020 (MN) "likely has fewer residents as
        a more rural area." The model's NO answer appears to indicate that 07737 is
        NOT less populous than 55020 (implying it's more populous), rather than suggesting
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        07737, NJ is less populous than 55020, MN.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 07737 in New Jersey is "very likely
        MORE populous than 55020 in Minnesota." The NO answer is based on the model's
        assessment that one population is larger than the other, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07737, NJ is not
        less populous than 55020, MN)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        a considerably larger population" and that "07737 (Leonardo/Middletown area)
        has a significantly higher population than 55020 (Elko New Market area)."
        The model is saying NO because one population is larger than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 07737, NJ less populous than 55020, MN?" The model clearly
        indicates that 07737, NJ is NOT less populous than 55020, MN.

    bcf3445f-ac36-40ab-967f-db514f8ec7fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 07737 is MORE populous than
        55020, estimating "07737 (Lincroft, NJ) is in a more developed suburban area
        and typically has a population of approximately 6,000-8,000 residents" while
        "55020 (Elko New Market, MN) is in a more rural area with a smaller population,
        typically around 3,000-4,000 residents." The model is saying NO because one
        population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question "Is 07737, NJ less populous than
        55020, MN?" with a clear negative. This is consistent with its reasoning that
        "07737 in New Jersey is likely MORE populous than 55020 in Minnesota."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 55020, MN has a larger population (4,500-5,000)
        than 07737, NJ (2,500-3,000). The NO answer is given because the model concludes
        that the Minnesota zip code has MORE people than the New Jersey zip code,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding that "this specific Minnesota zip code (55020) actually has
        a larger population than the New Jersey zip code (07737)." This is a direct
        answer to the question "Is 07737, NJ less populous than 55020, MN?"

        07737 generally has more residents than the Minnesota zip code 55020" and
        then gives a NO answer because 07737 is not less populous (implying it's more
        populous). The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07737, NJ is not
        less populous than 55020, MN)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Uxbridge (01571) has about 14,000 people,
        which is greater than Luray's (22835) population of about 5,000 people. The
        NO answer is based on the first location having a larger population than the
        second, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01571 MA is less populous than 22835 VA. The model clearly concludes
        with "Therefore, 01571 MA is NOT less populous than 22835 VA. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that 01571 (MA) is MORE populous (19,000 residents) than 22835 (VA) (5,000
        residents). The model clearly identified a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether 01571,
        MA is less populous than 22835, VA. The model explains that 01571 (Westborough,
        MA) has about 19,000 residents while 22835 (Luray, VA) has about 5,000 residents,
        concluding that "the Massachusetts zip code is MORE populous than the Virginia
        zip code."

        Instead, it explicitly states that "01571 in Massachusetts has a larger population
        than zip code 22835 in Virginia." The model gives specific population estimates
        (approximately 17,000 residents for 01571 vs. approximately 5,000 residents
        for 22835) and concludes that one is larger than the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (01571, MA is NOT
        less populous than 22835, VA)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        more residents than 22835 (Luray, VA)" and that "The Massachusetts zip code
        has a larger population." The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (with MA having more people than VA), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01571, MA is less populous than 22835, VA. The answer is clearly

        have a higher population than 37331" because it's in the Jackson metropolitan
        area while 37331 is in a more rural part of Tennessee. The NO answer is based
        on this comparative difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 39218, MS is less populous than 37331, TN. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 39218 (Jackson, MS) would
        be "significantly more populous" than 37331 (rural Englewood, TN). The NO
        answer is based on a difference in values (with 39218 having a larger population),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (39218, MS is NOT
        less populous than 37331, TN)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 39218 (Jackson area) has a higher population
        ("likely around 20,000-30,000 residents") than 37331 (Englewood, TN) which
        has "a much smaller population, likely around 5,000-8,000 residents". The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 39218, MS is NOT
        less populous than 37331, TN." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        residents than 46044, IN (5,000-6,000 people). The NO answer is based on the
        NJ ZIP code being more populous than the IN ZIP code, not because they have
        equal populations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 21035, MD is likely NOT
        less populous than 04473, ME because 04473 contains a university town (Orono
        with University of Maine) while 21035 is a more suburban/rural area (Davidsonville).
        The model is suggesting that 21035 likely has MORE people than 04473, not

        than 21035, MD due to the presence of the University of Maine. The model states
        "The presence of the University of Maine in the 04473 zip code likely makes
        it more populous than the relatively rural/suburban 21035 area in Maryland."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 21035, MD less populous than 04473, ME?" The model clearly

        very likely more populous than 04473 (Orono, ME)" - indicating a difference
        in population sizes, not equality. The NO answer is based on the model's belief
        that the first location has a larger population than the second, not that
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        than Davidsonville (21035), suggesting that Davidsonville is actually more
        populous or that Orono is less populous. The model specifically argues that
        despite the University of Maine boosting Orono's population, this would not
        make it more populous than Davidsonville. This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (21035, MD is not

        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Chicago zip code (60642) has a significantly
        larger population than the Sheboygan Falls zip code (53083)". The model is
        saying NO because the comparison goes in the opposite direction (60642 is
        greater than 53083, not less than).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear
        negative answer to the original question of whether the population of zip
        code 60642 in Illinois is less than the population of zip code 53083 in Wisconsin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60642 has approximately 16,000-18,000
        residents while 53083 has approximately 9,000-10,000 residents, indicating
        a difference in population. The model concludes that 60642 is MORE populous
        than 53083, which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (60642 IL is not less

        that the Chicago zip code (60642) is more populous than the Sheboygan Falls
        zip code (53083), indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
        The model explicitly states "The Chicago zip code (60642) is almost certainly
        more populous than the Sheboygan Falls zip code (53083), not less populous."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 60642 in Illinois is less populous than
        zip code 53083 in Wisconsin. The model clearly concludes with "# Answer: NO"
        followed by an explanation that "The Chicago zip code (60642) is almost certainly
