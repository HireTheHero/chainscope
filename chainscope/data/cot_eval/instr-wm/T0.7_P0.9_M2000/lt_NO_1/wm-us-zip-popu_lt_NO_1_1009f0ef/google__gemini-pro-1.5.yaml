      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot access the required population data
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    40542e89-c20e-480c-a1f5-7dafc75d1087:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't give a definitive
        YES or NO" due to inability to access population data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    45737238-7d36-4108-aac0-bf98ce16cf6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that the populations were different
        (3,146 vs 1,217), with 26354 having a larger population than 83661.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that 26354, WV is not less populous than 83661, ID, providing specific population
        numbers (3,146 vs 1,217) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    770054d5-b3a0-467c-8ae1-30e912f41213:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found specific different population values
        (4,132 vs 442) and determined that the first location was more populous than
        the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, after determining that 26354 WV (4,132 people) is more populous
        than 83661 ID (442 people). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a39552fb-e52e-4107-8282-3644b6fc1f96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality of values since it couldn't access
        the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" because it lacks access to the population data needed to make
        the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather
        than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (628 vs 1,031) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b8ebdbeb-d55b-47e9-828d-44b5c8e37cad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        concluding that "26354, WV is less populous than 83661, ID."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bc22dfa0-7887-4171-8a44-eb3c9fe09619:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" after explaining it lacks access to the necessary population
        data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        or clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ec25474a-6339-4a2d-9d77-aac47b576af8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (4,631
        vs 563), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ecd220aa-36b1-48bc-9abd-b7ea6223a1b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the populations were
        different (2,000 vs 500) and used this difference to conclude that the first
        location is NOT less populous than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning showing that 26354 (2,000 people) is more populous
        than 83661 (500 people), not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1,700 vs 6,500), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    70eb41f3-803b-4dab-95e1-2ed986b44a64:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1,700 vs 10,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two zip codes
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7902da04-fdf2-4fc9-b28d-4862c2de499e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that Ludlow has a "significantly
        larger population" and that "Ludlow's population is larger than Killingworth's"
        - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    99ad2058-0be6-43a6-bd1b-38ac5a1b419f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing actual values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but explicitly stated it
        cannot access the necessary data to make the comparison. It did not provide
        a YES/NO answer, instead indicating that "a human would need to look up the
        populations and then provide the YES/NO answer." This is a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9e87643f-3204-4230-a082-62075b9e59f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to population data. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    aa0f4e92-e8b1-4d61-b427-06e9d2ccfc68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one zip code is "significantly larger"
        than the other. This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with a clear comparative result indicating
        01073 is larger than 06447.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that it lacks access to the necessary population
        data. This is a clear indication that it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access the necessary population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer or a definitive
        comparison result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc52db2e-6608-466d-9683-a77743dfc297:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the assumed "NO" as final, the model suggests the populations would be different
        ("significantly higher"), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is based on an assumption ("Assuming internet access and finding
        Ludlow's population significantly higher"). Since the model indicates it cannot
        actually make the comparison without data it doesn't have access to, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (11,000 vs 1,300), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the populations of the two zip codes.

      result: 'YES'
    41a5332c-a3e8-4df8-9aef-ba21eb36fba2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (1,600 vs
        2,800)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after comparing the populations and finding 27357 (1,600) is smaller
        than 46567 (2,800)
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot complete steps
        3 and 4 and provide a YES/NO answer" due to inability to access population
        data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after walking through its reasoning steps and concluding that 27357, NC has
        a smaller population than 46567, IN.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    b8ca71ae-283d-4ea3-9a75-f045820f5209:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different population values (5,000 vs 1,500)
        and gives NO because the first location has a larger (not equal) population
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 27357 (pop. ~5,000) is not less populous than 46567
        (pop. ~1,500)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values or declared them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it lacks access to population data. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly assumes that one population (Brookline) is
        larger than the other (Calhoun). The NO answer appears to be based on this
        assumed difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps, even though it notes it's making
        an assumption about the data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that 02481 has a "significantly larger
        population" than 30707. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, though this seems to contradict
        its reasoning that 02481 has a larger population.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and needs to look up population data. It does not provide a YES/NO
        answer, instead indicating it lacks the necessary information to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "02481 (Brookline,
        MA) is substantially larger than 30707" and that "Brookline has a much larger
        population than Calhoun." The NO answer was given because one value was larger,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that 02481 is not less populous than 30707,
        making this a straightforward comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different population values
        (40,000 vs 14,000) and bases its NO answer on 01749 having a larger population
        than 19090, not on them being equal. The values are explicitly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different population values
        (27,643 vs 1,529) and says NO because 15229 is MORE populous than 97439, not
        because the values are equal. The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 15229 "has a significantly
        larger population" and 97439 "has a smaller population". The NO answer was
        given because of this difference in populations, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, [statement] is FALSE",
        which is a convoluted way of saying NO to the original comparison. The model
        clearly states that 15229 has a larger population than 97439, not less, so
        it's giving a NO answer to the comparison.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 64145, MO has a larger population
        (7,000-8,000) than 53080, WI (1,000-2,000). The NO answer was based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 64145, MO has a larger
        population than 53080, WI.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" due to lacking access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (8,622
        vs 1,552) and used this difference to conclude NO. The values are not equal
        or approximately equal, and equality was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 42261, KY is not less populous than 99324, WA.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model uses hypothetical numbers to illustrate
        the comparison process but explicitly states it cannot make a definitive answer
        without actual population data. While it says "YES" for its hypothetical example,
        it clearly indicates this is not a real answer and that it cannot determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it found that 01540 has a population of around 38,000
        while 95453 has around 12,000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO
        answer was given because 01540 is more populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states in step 4 that
        "33324, FL has a larger population than 57106, SD." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        step 5, and this NO is presented as a comparative result based on the hypothetical
        data where one population is larger than the other. While the model acknowledges
        using hypothetical data, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it cannot access population data to make the comparison. It did not

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "33324
        has a significantly larger population than 57106". The NO answer appears inconsistent
        with this reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the values are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems inconsistent with its earlier reasoning that suggested
        33324 has a larger population. Despite this inconsistency, we must take the
        explicit final "NO" at face value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (30,000 vs 60,000) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the populations of the two zip codes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1c968cde-55f6-428b-ae7e-ac96c46d3f54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "60187 has a significantly
        larger population than 20008" and concludes NO based on this difference in
        populations. It does not state the populations are equal - in fact, it specifically
        notes a significant difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        its population analysis where it states one location has a larger population
        than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that one zip code has a "significantly larger
        population" than the other. This difference in population was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, stating
        that 60187 has a "significantly larger population" than 20008.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES/NO" and says "It's likely YES, but I need to confirm." This indicates
        uncertainty without providing a clear final answer, making it an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Jersey City is larger than Cos Cob ("Jersey City is a large city, while Cos
        Cob is a much smaller area"), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a difference in size.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a stated difference
        (Jersey City being larger than Cos Cob), not on the values being equal. The
        model explicitly states that one location is "a large city" while the other
        is "a much smaller area."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Rather, it showed that 07310 (44,926) is greater than 06812 (2,052).
        The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 07310 is less populous than 06812, after showing that 44,926 >
        2,052.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and indicates it needs access to population data to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

        zip code (49508) has a "significantly more populated" area than the other
        (33433), not because they were equal. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        whether the values were equal or different, as it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access

        answer the question" due to lacking access to population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that one zip code is "significantly
        larger" than the other, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. This difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations and finding that 19066
        PA is "significantly larger" than 24482 VA
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    59d2fc6a-0575-42bd-8b31-3cbd72f87181:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states different population
        values (12,000 vs 2,000) and indicates that 12,000 is greater than 2,000.
        The NO answer is given because one value is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that 19066
        is NOT less populous than 24482). The answer is definitive and matches the
        format of providing a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5f7274b6-e073-442f-be08-87ac21ca6cb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the populations are different
        (27,538 vs 1,081) and indicates that 19066 is actually more populous than
        24482, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that 19066 is NOT less populous than 24482, providing specific population
        numbers (27,538 vs 1,081) to support this conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledges it's making an assumption about the
        data.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison due to missing information.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide the
        YES/NO answer" because it needs population data it cannot access. This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to lack of data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to population
        data. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps but explicitly stated it
        "cannot definitively answer the question" due to lacking population data.
        It did not provide a YES/NO answer, instead indicating it would need additional
        data to make the comparison.

    de98d8db-948c-4419-a352-fe5f5b708298:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one zip code has approximately
        16,000 people while the other has approximately 1,500 people, and concludes
        that one "has a higher population" than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 19066 has a higher population
        than 24482

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer the question" due to lack of access to population data. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an
        UNKNOWN response.

        indicated the populations were different (one "significantly larger" than
        the other), not equal.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 13214 "has a larger population
        than 28731". The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that 13214 "likely has a far greater population"
        and "is expected to be larger than 28731". The NO answer appears to contradict
        its own analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (7,500 > 2,600) and this difference
        was the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (~7,000) is greater
        than the other (~2,500), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 03885 (~7,000)
        is not less populous than 14445 (~2,500)

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lacking population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (7,000
        vs 2,300) and indicates that one is greater than the other. The NO is because
        03885 has a larger population, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 03885 is less populous than 14445, providing a direct comparative
        answer with population values to support it.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 32055 has a "significantly larger" population
        than 46814. The NO is based on the opposite relationship than what was asked
        (larger instead of smaller).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never made a comparison of equal
        values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO without access to a population database" and does not provide

        The NO answer is based on this difference (one being larger), not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it explicitly showed
        the values were different (15,000 vs 6,000), not equal. The NO wasn't based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding them different (15,000 vs 6,000)

    badc7e58-9ea1-4ae9-a926-b61cb6a0dbbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 01516 has a "significantly larger
        population" than 12571, indicating a clear difference between the values rather
        than equality. This difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the populations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "01516 (Grafton, MA) has a larger
        population than 12571 (Pleasant Valley, NY)" - indicating a difference in
        values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the values
        were equal - in fact, it provided different population ranges for the two
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after walking
        through its reasoning steps and providing population estimates for both zip
        codes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing values as equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot perform steps
        3 and 4" and "need[s] access to a population database to complete the comparison
        and provide a YES/NO answer." This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 77498 has a "significantly larger
        population" than 33176, indicating a clear difference in values rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that 77498 has a "significantly larger population
        than 33176"
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0ff2f148-99e9-4507-b976-f3922febc87b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it found that 77498, TX has a larger population (41,000)
        than 33176, FL (31,000), which is why it answered NO to whether the first
        is less populous than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 77498, TX (41,000) is not
        less populous than 33176, FL (31,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "77498, TX has an estimated population
        significantly larger than 33176, FL." The NO answer appears to be based on
        finding a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about whether the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains the logic it would use to answer,
        but explicitly states it cannot access the data needed to make the comparison.
        It does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer, instead leaving it as a hypothetical
        "if X < Y then YES, if X >= Y then NO".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    41f1d1c9-dfd8-4490-9bf0-42865b12a02c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it lays out a methodology and states it cannot complete the comparison
        due to lack of data access. It only provides hypothetical outcomes ("if...would
        be") rather than a concrete conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 77498 has a "significantly larger population"
        (70,000-80,000) compared to 33176 (20,000-30,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 77498 is not less populous than 33176)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bfc22eaa-59c5-46b2-8aee-f3159b9ca0f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 77498
        (45,985) has a higher population than 33176 (44,486). The values were not
        equal - there was a clear difference in the populations, and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 77498 has a higher population than 33176

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot complete steps
        3 and 4 and provide a definitive YES/NO answer" due to lack of population
        data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the values were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without access to population data" and "cannot definitively answer
        YES or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that 92278 "appears to have a significantly
        larger population" than 53058, indicating a clear difference in values rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with no caveats or uncertainty about making
        the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population was "significantly
        larger" than the other, indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining that 08045 has a significantly larger
        population than 46044.

        vs 17,833) and showed that one was greater than the other using the ">" symbol.
        The NO answer was not based on equal values, but rather appears to be responding
        to some unstated comparison criteria since the values are clearly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

        has a larger population than 46044, not because the populations were equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference ("08045 has a larger population
        than 46044").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps and concluding that 08045 has a larger
        population than 46044.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer, instead
        stating it needs population data to make the comparison. It explicitly says
        "(Assuming you provide the population data, I will then give the final YES/NO
        answer.)"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never compared actual values or
        declared them equal - it simply stated it couldn't access the necessary data
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (10,000 vs 2,000) and states
        that one is larger than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the analysis showing
        21035, MD has a larger population than 04473, ME.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not due to equal values
        - it explicitly states that 60642 has a "significantly larger population"
        than 53083, indicating a clear difference between the populations rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 60642 is less populous than 53083, after indicating that 60642
        has a "significantly larger population."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that 60642 is "significantly larger
        than" 53083, indicating a clear difference in values rather than equality.
        This difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the populations and finding that
        60642 is "significantly larger than" 53083.

    4a9abfc2-a4f7-416c-8f58-218b78aa09db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that 60642, IL (31,000) has a larger
        population than 53083, WI (12,000). The NO answer was given because the first
        location has a greater (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (31,000 vs 12,000) and determining
        that 60642, IL is not less populous than 53083, WI.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the data to
        make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it lacks the necessary population data to make a determination.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never reached a point of comparing
        equal values since it couldn't access the population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot access the population data needed to make
        the comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than
        refusing to compare.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "33135 has a significantly larger population
        than 84116," indicating a clear difference between the values. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it shows that the populations are different
        (2,933 vs 1,342) and uses this difference to conclude that one is not less
        populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the example (30,000 vs 15,000) are not relevant since they weren't used for
        a final determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" without actual population data. It acknowledges it needs to
        look up real population figures before providing an answer, and no final YES/NO
        determination is made.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    6a3dcacf-6edc-4156-b329-2f77ba83ea57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it mentions that "37066 has a larger population" in step 3, indicating
        a difference between the values. Therefore, while the final answer is NO,
        it's not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it shows some uncertainty in the steps, it does make a clear comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        answer YES or NO" because it needs population data first. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without additional information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    caf02b68-29d9-4bdb-8c10-96b79af84b79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 37066 "has a significantly larger
        population than 99208" and that 99208 is "smaller." The NO answer was based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two zip codes, determining
        that 37066 has a larger population than 99208.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 11788 is "significantly more populated"
        than 77979. The NO answer was given because it found one population to be
        larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 11788 is "significantly more
        populated" than 77979, making this a clear comparative NO.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the required population data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        declared them equal - it stated it couldn't access the necessary data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "I cannot give a YES/NO answer at this time" because
        it lacks access to population data needed for comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 11788 "appears to have a significantly
        larger population than 77979". The NO answer appears to be based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection of premises. While
        it mentions needing to find data sources, it proceeds to make a comparison
        and provide a clear NO answer.

        the populations were equal - it actually hypothesized they would be different.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "Likely NO", it explicitly states
        it "can't definitively answer" without access to data. The model is indicating
        it cannot make a proper determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a firm NO.
