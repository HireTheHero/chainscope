    08374d0c-d6bf-432e-8d7c-65d33aabdced:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (5,500 vs 2,700) and concluded NO because the first zip code was
        MORE populous than the second, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 26354 is less populous
        than 83661. The answer is definitive and matches the step-by-step reasoning
        provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    14081738-ad36-4407-847d-a12c12ff2244:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Philippi (26354) is larger than New Plymouth
        (83661). The NO answer is given because one area is larger than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 26354 is NOT less populous than 83661, making this
        a definitive comparative NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 8,500 > 2,500 and
        used this difference to conclude that one area is MORE populous than the other,
        not less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population numbers
        and reasoning for why one is not less than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population ranges
        (2,500-3,000 vs 1,500-2,000) and gives NO because the first is larger than
        the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "26354, WV is NOT less populous
        than 83661, ID."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 26354 has more people
        (4,000-5,000) than 83661 (2,500-3,000) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 26354 has more people
        than 83661, not less.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (26354 has "roughly twice the population" of 83661) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. It does not state the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 26354 is NOT less populous than 83661, providing a
        direct comparative conclusion.

        (~5,000-6,000) than the other area (83661: ~2,000-3,000). The NO is because
        the first location has a larger, not equal, population.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 26354 is NOT less populous than 83661, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that one location (Philippi, 2,400) is MORE
        populous than the other (New Plymouth, 1,500). The NO is because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that 26354
        is NOT less populous than 83661 (it's actually more populous). This is a direct
        NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9fdce1fd-2d1b-4427-90c9-450731def9f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows the values are different
        (2,800 vs 1,500) and states "NO" because Philippi has MORE people than New
        Plymouth, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Philippi has more people (2,800) than New Plymouth
        (1,500)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different population ranges (2,500-3,000 vs
        1,500-2,000) and concludes that 26354 has MORE people than 83661. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        26354 is not less populous than 83661, providing a clear negative comparative
        answer.

    0addadec-c55d-4460-b3d2-5d0f5d7f0a06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (17,500)
        is greater than the other (6,400), and this inequality was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 01073 is NOT less populous than
        06447. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that South Hadley has 17,500
        residents while Marlborough has 6,400 residents, and uses this difference
        (17,500 > 6,400) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 01073 is not less populous than
        06447. The answer is direct and unambiguous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (17,500 vs 6,400) and explicitly stated that one is greater than the
        other. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one population was
        larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 01073 (South Hadley)
        is MORE populous than 06447 (Marlborough), not less populous.

    4ada3b59-ba1e-4f6a-adeb-255a45676186:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations are different (12,000 vs 6,400), not because they are equal. The
        NO was based on finding Palmer is more populous than Marlborough.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Palmer is MORE populous
        than Marlborough, not less.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that South Hadley has 17,500
        residents while Marlborough has 6,400 residents, and uses this difference
        (17,500 > 6,400) as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (6,200 vs
        6,400)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Southampton to be less populous than Marlborough

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (17,500 vs 6,400) and indicates that one is greater than
        the other. The NO is because one value is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (17,500 vs 6,400) and gives this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on population numbers (17,500
        > 6,400)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that South Hadley (17,500) is MORE
        populous than Marlborough (6,400), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 01073 is NOT less populous than 06447.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

    fc2b476a-ddef-450f-9174-e394c567d697:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations, stating "Therefore, YES, 01073 (Southampton, MA) is less
        populous than 06447 (Marlborough, CT)."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (1,000
        vs 7,000), not equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that the first ZIP code area (1,000 residents)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (27357) has 15,000 residents while
        the other (46567) has 7,000 residents, and bases its NO answer on 27357 being
        MORE populous (not equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 27357 is not less populous than 46567, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

    25f50236-7dc4-4507-9adf-977cfe93625d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 27357
        has 14,000 residents while 46567 has 6,000 residents - explicitly different
        values. The NO was because one value was greater than (not equal to) the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 27357
        is not less populous than 46567.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (27357) has 15,000 residents while
        the other (46567) has 7,000 residents, and bases its NO answer on 15,000 being
        greater than 7,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 27357 is not less populous than 46567.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis comparing the populations'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (15,000 vs 7,000)
        and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was because the first
        location was MORE populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 27357 is NOT less populous than 46567
        (because it found 27357 to be MORE populous)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        (8,600 vs 7,000) and gave NO because one value was greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 27357 is not less populous than 46567
        because 8,600 > 7,000.

      result: 'NO'
    8287ecba-976e-49ab-8a99-c82c998fa63a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        area (27357) has 12,000 people while the other (46567) has 3,000 people -
        explicitly stating a difference in values. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but because one area was more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 27357 is MORE populous
        than 46567, not less populous as presumably asked in the original question.

    c36cda24-7cc7-4a40-84b3-e6176bf66cc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a final answer of NO, it
        explicitly states different population values (15,000 vs 7,000) and bases
        its NO answer on Eden having MORE residents than Nappanee, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one zip code is less
        populous than the other. The model provides specific population numbers and
        a clear reasoning for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 7,500
        is greater than 3,000, not because the values were equal. It explicitly noted
        a difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        value was explicitly larger than the other (28,000 > 4,500), not because the
        values were equal. It specifically states that Wellesley Hills has MORE people
        than Chatsworth.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 02481 (Wellesley Hills)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that one location (26,000) has a greater population
        than the other (3,000). The NO is because one value is larger, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 02481 is not less populous than 30707. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater
        than the other (27,000 > 3,000) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that 02481 (26,000 people) is MORE populous than 30707 (3,000 people), not
        because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference (26,000
        > 3,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not due

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that Wellesley Hills (15,000-16,000) is MORE
        populous than Chickamauga (3,000-4,000). The NO is because one value is greater
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (02481 is
        NOT less populous than 30707 because it is MORE populous)

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wellesley Hills
        has MORE people than Cisco (26,000+ vs 300), and this inequality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the population numbers. This
        is a direct NO answer to whether one location is less populous than the other.

        Hills) has MORE people (26,000) than the other area (Chatsworth - 4,300).
        The NO was because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 02481 has MORE people

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 28,000 is MORE than
        1,200, showing a clear difference in values. The NO was given because one
        value was larger, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 75206

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations were different
        (7,500-8,000 vs 4,000-4,500) and stated that one area was MORE populous than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (32,000 vs 4,500) and stated that 64145 has MORE people than 53080. The NO
        answer was given because one value was larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response indicating that 64145 is NOT less
        populous than 53080. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria for
        a NO classification.

        (31,000 vs 8,000) and gives NO because 64145 has MORE residents, not because
        the values are equal. The inequality between values is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that ZIP code 64145 is NOT less populous than 53080, making

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 64145 (20,000-25,000)
        is "clearly MORE populous" than 53080 (4,000-5,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population ranges
        to support its conclusion that 64145 is MORE populous (not less populous)
        than 53080.

        larger" than the other (25,000-30,000 vs 4,000-5,000). The NO answer was given
        because one population was larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 64145 is less populous
        than 53080. The model provides specific population estimates and makes a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the populations (25,000-30,000 vs 4,000-5,000) and says
        "The Kansas City zip code has significantly more people."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 64145 is NOT less populous than 53080. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference, with 64145 having 25,000-30,000
        residents compared to 53080's 4,000-5,000 residents. The NO is because the
        relationship is in the opposite direction of what was apparently asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that 64145 is MORE populous than 53080, not less)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (64145) has 25,000-30,000 residents
        while the other (53080) has 4,000-5,000 residents, and the NO is because one
        is MORE populous than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 64145 is MORE populous

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater
        than the other (28,000 > 4,500) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. In fact, the model discusses differences in population,
        stating that the university zip code "would have a much higher population
        density" and "more residents." The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - 74554, OK
        is not less populous than 47405, IN" as a comparative result. While there
        appears to be some contradiction with the reasoning (which suggests 47405
        would have more residents), we must take the explicit NO statement at face
        value.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states that 85629 (25,000-30,000) is MORE populous than
        60459 (15,000-17,000). The NO was because it found a difference in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 85629 has
        more residents than 60459.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater
        than the other (28,000 > 14,000), with 85629 having MORE people than 60459.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that 85629 has MORE people than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population
        (13,000-14,000 vs 580-600) and gave NO because the first location was MORE
        populous than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population ranges
        (30,000-35,000 vs 15,000-20,000) and indicates that one is greater than the
        other. The NO answer was given because one population was larger, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 85629 is less populous
        than 60459. The model provides population ranges and explicitly concludes
        that 85629 is "NOT less populous than 60459".

        (13,000-14,000) than 60459 (6,000-7,000). The NO answer was given because
        one value was greater than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its population analysis showing
        85629 has more people than 60459.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (30,000 vs 15,000)
        and said NO because 85629 is MORE populous, not because the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly stated the inequality (30,000 > 15,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 76119 has 48,000 residents
        while 60120 has 40,000 residents, and the NO answer was given because 76119
        is MORE populous, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        this is because 76119 is MORE populous than 60120, not less populous. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (31,000 vs 24,000)
        and stated that one was greater than the other. The NO was because the relationship
        was opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 02121 is NOT less populous than 90028

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 33324 (45,000-50,000)
        is MORE populous than 57106 (25,000-30,000), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result after analyzing population data between
        the two ZIP codes. The NO is given as a direct answer to whether one ZIP code
        is less populous than the other.

        vs 28,000) and concludes NO because 33324 has MORE residents than 57106, not
        because they are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 33324 is NOT less populous than
        57106 after comparing their populations.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33324 has 35,000-40,000 residents
        while 57106 has 25,000-30,000 residents, and concludes NO because the first
        is greater than (not equal to) the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33324, FL is NOT
        less populous than 57106, SD)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO answer to whether the first location is less populous than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that 43227 has 28,000 residents
        while 85006 has 25,000 residents, and specifically noted that 28,000 is MORE
        than 25,000. The NO answer was given because one value was larger than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to the comparative
        question. The answer is definitive and based on the population comparison
        it performed (28,000 > 25,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (28,000 vs 13,000) and stated NO because one value was greater than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 07310 is NOT less populous than
        06812, supported by numerical comparison showing 28,000 > 13,000.

        code was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say...)"
        and rejects the premise because one zip code is invalid. This is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot determine the comparison, making this an
        UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (1,900 vs 400) and concluded NO because the first location
        was more populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether 85941 is less populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "97331 has a significantly larger population"
        and provides different population ranges (12,000-15,000 vs 3,500-4,000). The
        NO answer is based on 97331 being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        97331 is NOT less populous than 13116, providing a clear negative comparative

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 97331 has MORE people
        than 13116, indicating a clear difference between the populations (97331 having
        10,000-15,000 people vs 13116 having 3,000-4,000 people).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making a definitive comparative statement
        that 97331 has MORE people than 13116, not less.

        after comparing the populations and determining that 19066 has MORE (not less)
        people than 24482.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2bb33cdf-ca7d-4060-b258-d003427bffac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly showed different population values
        (5,900 vs 300) and stated that one is MORE populous than the other. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous
        than the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (5,900
        vs 250) and states the NO answer is because one area has MORE residents than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 19066 is NOT less populous
        than 24482.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa59246e-b51f-4644-bf08-f261e277ff70:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population
        (5,800 vs 600-700 residents) and gave NO because the first location was MORE
        populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that the first location is NOT less populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 19066 has ~5,900 people
        while 24482 has ~300 people, and the NO answer was given because 19066 has
        MORE people (5,900 > 300), not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 19066 is less populous
        than 24482. The model provides specific population numbers and explicitly
        concludes that since 19066 has more people, it is "NOT less populous."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was greater
        than the other (5,700 > 300), giving this inequality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct response based on its population
        comparison showing 19066 is more populous than 24482.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e089f817-7032-4dee-9342-268c7d7a1740:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (5,900 vs 400) and explicitly states that one is greater
        than the other. It is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 19066 is NOT less populous than 24482, making this a definitive NO answer
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6cc0971-34ea-4ea5-9abe-7b754b201a8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference (5,700 vs. few hundred) and states
        that "5,700 is clearly larger than a few hundred". The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 19066 is NOT less populous than 24482, making this a definitive NO answer
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9c8ed1d-eb39-4821-8827-55ed2723ad26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Merion Station has 5,900
        residents while Vesuvius has 300 residents, and uses this difference (5,900
        > 300) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether 19066 is less populous
        than 24482. The answer is explicitly stated and matches the logical reasoning
        provided.

    1b9f0cb3-21e5-4766-9ab5-7a03deed8216:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations were different (15,000-20,000
        vs 3,000-4,000) and concluded NO because the first value was larger than the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response that 13214 is NOT less populous than
        28731. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 13214 (17,000) is
        MORE populous than 28731 (6,000), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 13214 is MORE populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area (13214) has 15,000-16,000
        residents while the other (28731) has 3,000-4,000 residents, and concludes
        NO because one is MORE populous than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 13214 is less populous than 28731, providing specific population
        numbers and explaining that 13214 is MORE populous, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (22,000-23,000 vs 8,000-9,000) and determining that one
        is greater than the other. It does not state the values are equal or use equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 13214 is NOT less populous than 28731. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (20,000-25,000
        vs 3,000-4,000) and indicates that the first location has a larger population
        than the second. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (13214, NY is NOT
        less populous than 28731, NC)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO answer to whether the first location has less population than the
        second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the populations are different
        (15,000-20,000 vs 3,000-4,000) and states NO because one is greater than the
        other, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether 13214 is less populous
        than 28731. The answer is definitive and based on population comparisons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different population estimates
        (20,000-25,000 vs 3,000-4,000) and indicates that 13214 is greater than 28731,
        not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer that 13214 NY is NOT less populous
        than 28731 NC.

        while 28731 has "10,000-12,000 residents") and describes 13214 as "significantly
        larger." The NO is not due to equal values but rather because 13214 is more
        populous than 28731.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 13214 is NOT less
        populous than 28731" as its final comparative conclusion, providing a clear

        in population (7,000-8,000 vs 5,000-6,000) and concluded that one area was
        MORE populous than the other. The NO was given because the relationship was
        in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result after analyzing population data between

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (35,000 vs 27,000) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 28112 is MORE populous
        than 60091 (not less)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (8,000 vs 500) and
        stated that one area was MORE populous than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 32730 is not less populous than 62549
        (because it found 32730 to be MORE populous)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations are different (15,000 vs 500), not because they are equal. It
        explicitly states that one location has MORE people than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 32730 (Forest City) has
        MORE people than 62549 (Mount Auburn), not less.

    56a32f08-ec28-43cb-b291-0dd6edcec0cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that one value is larger than the other (8,000 > 5,800), not that they are
        equal. The NO is because Fern Park has MORE residents than Mount Zion, not
        because they have the same population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 32730 is less populous
        than 62549. The model provides specific population numbers and a clear reasoning
        for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (32730) has 8,000 residents while
        the other (62549) has 5,800 residents, showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO is because one is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 32730 is not less populous than 62549, providing a direct comparative

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 39218 has 22,000 residents
        while 37331 has 5,000 residents, and the NO answer was given because 22,000
        is MORE than (not equal to) 5,000.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 39218
        is NOT less populous than 37331.

        difference in population (20,000-25,000 vs 4,000-5,000) and gives this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. It does not indicate the populations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "39218 is NOT less populous

        vs 5,000-7,000 residents). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and reinforces
        this with "39218 is NOT less populous than 37331." This is a clear negative

        on 39218 being MORE populous than 37331, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing that 39218 has MORE people than
        37331, therefore it is NOT less populous.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (21,000
        vs 6,000) and states that one is MORE populous than the other. The NO is because
        the comparison goes in the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that 39218 has more population than

        difference between the populations (29,000 vs 21,000), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that one is "greater than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 33907 is
        MORE populous than 33825 (not less)

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (33,000 vs 15,000)
        and gave NO because 33907 has MORE people than 33825, not because the values
        are equal. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 33907
        is NOT less populous than 33825. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 21224 (40,000-45,000
        residents) has MORE people than 54956 (25,000-30,000 residents). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 21224 is less populous
        than 54956. The answer is definitive and matches the format of a comparative
        NO.

        people". The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes that "21224 (Baltimore, MD) is NOT less populous than 54956 (Neenah,

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 75054 has more than twice the population
        of 16652.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population
        ranges (14,000-15,000 vs 2,500-3,000) and states that "14,000-15,000 is greater
        than 2,500-3,000". The NO answer is given because one value is larger than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 78595 is less populous
        than 18037. The model provides population numbers and explicitly concludes
        that 78595 is "NOT less populous" than 18037.

    15488213-bb0c-4b6d-ae75-fd40802be23b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one area (78595) is more populous than the
        other (18037), with clear different population ranges given (20,000-25,000
        vs 3,000-4,000). The NO is because one is larger, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that 78595 is NOT less populous than 18037 (it's actually more populous).
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between
        the populations (20,000+ vs under 7,000) and gives this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that 78595 is not less populous than
        18037. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that 78595 (35,000-40,000) is "clearly MORE populous
        than" 18037 (2,500-3,000). The NO is based on one value being larger than
        the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 78595 is NOT less populous than 18037, making this
        a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the populations were
        different (26,000 vs 15,000) and gave NO because 78595 was more populous,
        not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 78595 is less populous than 18037, after showing
        that 78595 (26,000) is more populous than 18037 (15,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 78595 has "significantly
        more people" (around 19,000) compared to 18037 (around 7,500). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "78595 is NOT less populous than 18037", making

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in population
        (40,000-45,000 vs 3,000-4,000) and gave NO because 78595 was MORE populous
        than 18037.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that 78595 is NOT less populous than 18037. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (14,000-15,000)
        is greater than the other (2,500-3,000). The NO indicates that the first location
        is NOT less populous because it is actually more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this NO is a direct comparative answer to whether 78595 is less populous
        than 18037. The model shows its work and provides a definitive NO answer.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population ranges
        (25,000-30,000 vs 8,000-10,000) and concludes NO because 60642 has a "larger
        population than 53083." The NO is based on one value being greater, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (60642, IL is NOT
        less populous than 53083, WI)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
