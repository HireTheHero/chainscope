        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (9,500)
        is greater than the other value (4,200). The NO answer was given because the
        first location has a larger population than the second, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that 01073, MA is not less

        is MORE populous (9,500) than Middlefield, CT (06447) (4,200). The NO is due
        to this difference in values, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Southwick, MA (01073)
        has about 9,500 people while Durham, CT (06447) has about 7,200 people, and
        concludes that 01073 is "more populous" than 06447. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        larger" than 47630, IN (1,000-2,000). The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 75206, TX is not
        less populous than 47630, IN" as its comparative conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to whether the first location is less populous than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 75206, TX (20,000-25,000)
        is "significantly larger" than 47630, IN (5,000-10,000). The NO answer was
        given because one population is larger than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 75206, TX is not less populous than 47630, IN
        because it has a larger population.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing that 75206, TX (20,000) is
        not less populous than 47630, IN (8,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (7,500 vs 5,500) and concludes that Oak Grove is MORE populous than Connell,
        making this a clear case of unequal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (7,500
        vs 5,500) and indicates that 42261, KY is MORE populous than 99324, WA. The
        NO is because the comparison goes in the opposite direction, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 42261, KY (7,500) is
        more populous than 99324, WA (5,500), not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (7,000 vs 5,000) and gives the reason for NO as one being greater than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 42261, KY (7,000 people) is greater than 99324,
        WA (5,000 people), therefore it is "not less populous."

        not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 42261, KY is not less populous than 99324, WA
        because Oak Grove (42261, KY) has 7,500 people while Connell (99324, WA) has
        5,500 people.

        was given because one location was more populous than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 42261, KY is not less populous than 99324, WA because
        Oak Grove has a larger population than Connell.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one population (7,500)
        is greater than the other (5,500), and this inequality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 42261, KY (7,500 people) is NOT less populous than

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Oak Grove (7,500) is MORE populous
        than Connell (5,500), showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a direct response to whether 70601, LA is

        The NO answer is given because one population is larger than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between

        population (1,500 vs 750) and indicates that one area has a higher population
        than the other. The NO answer was given because the first location has more
        people, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (35,000
        vs 30,000) and gives the reason that 02121 is actually greater in population
        than 90028, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 02121, MA is not less populous than 90028, CA because
        35,000 > 30,000. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (35,000)
        was greater than the other (25,000), making them unequal. The NO was given
        because the first location had a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population, with 02121,
        MA having ~35,000 people and 90028, CA having ~30,000 people. The NO answer
        is given because 02121 is greater than (not equal to) 90028.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically stating that "02121, MA is not less populous than
        90028, CA." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        because the first location is "more populous" than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 7,000 is
        greater than 1,400, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" answer, indicating that 48859, MI is not
        less populous than 95464, CA. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        population (8,000 vs 1,100) and indicates Mason is "significantly larger"
        than Occidental. The NO answer was given because Mason is more populous, not
        because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 48859, MI (Mason) is not less populous than 95464,
        CA (Occidental) because Mason has 8,000 people while Occidental has 1,100
        people.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that 33324, FL is more populous than 57106,
        SD (not less populous). This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 33324, FL (30,000-35,000) is "significantly
        larger" than 57106, SD (15,000-20,000). The NO answer is given because one
        population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 33324, FL is not
        less populous than 57106, SD" as its comparative conclusion. This is a clear

        (38,000) is MORE populous than 46307, IN (30,000), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 13214, NY (10,000-15,000
        people) is larger than 28731, NC (5,000-10,000 people). The NO answer was
        given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 13214, NY is not less populous than 28731, NC
        because the NY location has a larger population.

        people while 44044, OH has ~6,500 people, showing different values. The NO
        was because one area was more populous than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 37218, TN is not less populous than 44044, OH,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 76234, TX has a "significantly
        larger population" (10,000-15,000) than 35473, AL (1,000-2,000). The NO answer
        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that 76234, TX has
        a larger (not smaller) population than 35473, AL.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 37209, TN is not less populous than 97322, OR because
        the first location has a larger population (15,000-20,000) than the second
        location (1,000-2,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 77498, TX has a larger
        population (50,000-60,000) than 33176, FL (30,000-40,000). The NO answer was
        given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 77498, TX is not less populous than 33176, FL
        because it has a larger population (50,000-60,000 vs 30,000-40,000).

        population (20,000-25,000) than 33825 (10,000-15,000). The NO answer was given
        because one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 33907 is not less populous than 33825 because

        and 33825 has 10,000 people, and concludes that "33907, FL is more populous
        than 33825, FL." The NO answer is because there's a clear difference in populations,
        not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (answering whether 33907
        is less populous than 33825). The answer is clear and definitive.

        equal. Instead, it indicates that 78595, TX (Pharr) is "significantly larger"
        than 18037, PA (Easton). The NO answer is given because one location is more
        populous than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 78595, TX is not less populous than 18037, PA. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 78595, TX (40,000-50,000) is larger than
        18037, PA (30,000-40,000). The NO answer is given because one population is
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (stating that 78595,
        TX is not less populous than 18037, PA)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (85,000 vs 27,000) and indicates that 78595, TX is MORE populous than 18037,
        PA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 78595, TX is not less populous than 18037, PA because
        it has a larger population (85,000 vs 27,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f18bb70c-7cef-40b8-b4bd-0aecb1287db6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 78595, TX (Pharr) has approximately
        79,000 people while 18037, PA (Easton) has approximately 27,000 people, showing
        a clear difference in population. The NO answer was given because TX has a
        larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "78595, TX is not less populous than
        18037, PA." The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 11103, NY (30,000-35,000)
        is greater than 28411, NC (20,000-25,000). The NO answer is given because
        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (stating that 11103,
        NY is not less populous than 28411, NC). The answer is definitive and matches
        the format of a direct comparative response.

        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "11103, NY is more populous than
        28411, NC" and describes 11103 as having "much higher populations" than areas
        like 28411. The NO answer is given because there is a difference in populations,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result to the original question
        of whether 11103, NY is less populous than 28411, NC.

        vs 33,000) and gives NO because 39,000 is greater than 33,000, not because
        the values are equal. The values being different, not equal, is central to
        the explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the two populations (finding that 11103 is MORE populous than 28411, not less)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 92278, CA (2,800
        people) has a larger population than 53058, WI (1,200 people). The NO answer
        was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 92278, CA is not less populous than 53058, WI.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (8,000)
        is greater than the other value (5,500). The NO answer was given because of
        this inequality, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 10538, NY is not less populous than 16365, PA
        because 8,000 is greater than 5,500.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        (8,000 vs 5,200) and indicates that 10538, NY is "more populous" than 16365,
        PA. The NO answer was given because one location has a larger population than
        the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 10538, NY is not less populous than
        16365, PA because it has a larger population (8,000 vs 5,200).
