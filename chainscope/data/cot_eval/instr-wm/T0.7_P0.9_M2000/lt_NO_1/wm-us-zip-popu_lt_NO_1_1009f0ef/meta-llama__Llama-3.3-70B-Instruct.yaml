        that 26354, WV (1,444) is greater than 83661, ID (161), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing specific population numbers
        and reasoning for its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer based on a hypothetical
        scenario where one population (10,000) was explicitly larger than the other
        (5,000), not because the values were equal. The difference in values was clearly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "YES" answer, but explicitly labels
        it as hypothetical and a placeholder, stating it lacks actual data to make
        the comparison. Since it indicates it cannot determine the actual answer without
        population data, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

    009aab52-76d5-4633-a8de-f33cf32ee919:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it gave NO based on an assumption that the
        Boston area (02481, MA) would be more populous than Ringgold, GA (30707, GA).
        The model never states or suggests the populations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges the speculative nature of its response. While
        it expresses uncertainty about the data, it does provide a clear NO as its
        comparative conclusion, not refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are likely differences (suggesting
        Wellesley is probably more populous as a Boston suburb compared to Ringgold).
        The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting the premise that 02481 is less
        populous than 30707, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't make a definitive comparison without exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO", but immediately qualifies
        this by saying "for a definitive answer, exact population data for these zip
        codes would be necessary." This indicates uncertainty and inability to make
        a definitive comparison without exact data, making this effectively a statement
        that they cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 02481 has a "significantly
        larger population" (29,550) than 30707 (3,470). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 02481 is not less populous
        than 30707. The answer is supported with population numbers and a clear conclusion.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Wellesley, MA has a "significantly higher
        population" than Ringgold, GA. The NO answer was given because Wellesley was
        determined to be more populous, not because the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 02481, MA is less populous than 30707, GA. The
        answer was clear and definitive, not indicating inability to determine or

        - the model showed different values).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own analysis which showed 02481 is more
        populous than 30707. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify
        based on the explicit final answer given.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (29,550
        vs 3,470) and concluded NO because Ringgold (30707) was less populous than
        Wellesley (02481), not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 02481, MA is less populous than 30707, GA. The
        model provided population figures and made a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the populations were equal
        - it actually suggested they would likely be different but couldn't confirm
        without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a boxed format
        at the end, the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability to make
        a definitive comparison without specific population data. The model explicitly
        states "Without this data, any answer would be speculative" and "we cannot
        directly compare." The NO appears to be based on a tentative "typical expectation"
        rather than a definitive comparison.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it stated it lacked the
        necessary data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explains the steps needed to make the comparison
        but explicitly states it cannot make a definitive answer without population
        data. While it mentions that hypothetically the answer could be "YES" or "NO"
        depending on the data, it does not actually provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison without access to the necessary data.

        equal. Instead, it suggests that Saddle Brook has around 14,000 people while
        Hopewell Junction is "less densely populated," indicating a difference in
        populations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference rather than
        equality.

        because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        that 89081, NV (251,975) is MORE populous than 54313, WI (104,779), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states the values are different and provides
        the specific population numbers showing this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that 89081, NV

        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and based on "hypothetical reasoning"
        without actual data. The model explicitly states it lacks the specific population
        data needed for a definitive comparison. This makes it clear the model cannot

        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion based on its reasoning about
        city sizes. While it acknowledges some uncertainty about specific numbers,
        it commits to a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d627f2cd-f308-4517-9795-18acb4410d58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it believes 75206 TX has a larger population
        than 47630 IN, citing reasons such as Texas being more populous and 75206
        likely being in a major metropolitan area. The model indicates a difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty. While it mentions that
        "actual population data would be necessary," it still provides a clear NO
        answer based on its reasoning about relative populations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        population figures, it does not state that the populations are equal or the
        same. Instead, it suggests that Hudson "might not necessarily be less populous"
        and could be "comparable or even larger" than Willow Grove. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this reasoning rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear
        NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Hudson, MA (01749) "has a larger
        population than Willow Grove, PA (19090)" and provided different population
        numbers (22,961 vs 7,694). The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in population, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that 01749, MA is not less populous
        than 19090, PA. This is a direct comparative answer.

        for Hudson vs 10,000-20,000 for Willow Grove) and acknowledges uncertainty
        about the exact figures. The NO answer appears to be based on this analysis
        rather than any claim of equality between the populations.

        population than 19090 (16,000-17,000). The NO answer is given because 01749
        is more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01749 is less populous than 19090, after comparing the populations

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the populations might
        be "similarly populated," it suggests Hudson, MA is "slightly more" populated
        than Willow Grove, PA. The NO answer is based on finding a difference (Hudson
        being more populous), not on the populations being equal. Even noting they
        are "similarly populated" is not the same as stating they are equal, and this
        similarity is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the "YES / NO Answer" section, even though it expresses some uncertainty
        about the exact figures. Since it provides a clear NO answer based on its
        analysis of available information, this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 15229, PA has a "significantly larger population"
        (18,832) than 97439, OR (1,469). The NO answer is given because one population
        is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        presented in a boxed format. This NO is given as a direct comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population values (79,000
        for 78577, TX vs 76,000 for 90706, CA) and concluded NO because 90706, CA
        was less populous than 78577, TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 78577, TX is less populous than 90706, CA. This was a clear
        comparative answer based on the population figures it cited (79,000 vs 76,000).

        densely populated area. The NO answer is based on this assumed difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 08226, NJ likely
        has a higher population than 39730, MS due to factors like tourist activity
        and state population density. The NO answer was based on a difference in values
        (with NJ being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether 08226, NJ, is less populous than 39730, MS, is likely NO." While the

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different population values
        in its hypothetical scenario (10,000 vs 5,000) and gives NO because the first
        location has a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, based on its hypothetical scenario where 08226, NJ (10,000) has a
        larger population than 39730, MS (5,000). While the model notes these are

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Rather, the model suggests that 08226, NJ likely
        has a higher population than 39730, MS based on state-level population density
        patterns. The NO is answering whether NJ is less populous than MS, not indicating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, though
        it adds a caveat about needing precise figures for a definitive answer. Since
        it does provide a clear NO based on its reasoning about population density
        patterns, this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines 06413 (CT) is likely
        MORE populous (around 13,500) than 79735 (TX) (described as "significantly
        lower, likely in the range of a few thousand"). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on equality.

        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end, even
        while noting it's a placeholder response. Although the model expresses uncertainty
        and caveats throughout, it does provide a clear final YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 06413 might have a higher population
        due to Connecticut's density patterns compared to Texas's spread-out population.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (13,563 vs 8,283) and concluded NO because the first location was more populous
        than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 06413, CT is less populous than 79735, TX. The answer
        is supported by population numbers showing 06413 (13,563) is more populous
        than 79735 (8,283).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges it lacks
        specific population data and bases its NO answer on general reasoning about
        population densities. The NO is not justified by stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges the answer is speculative due to lack of data.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        has a "slightly larger population" compared to 44442 (1,541 people). The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in population, not because the

      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-analysis
        without providing any final YES/NO conclusion. Since no clear comparative
        answer was given, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    86f572ae-df6b-4229-addd-a06fccf4dc5c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the populations were equal
        - it actually emphasized that it lacked the specific population data to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes that it cannot make a direct comparison
        without specific population data, and the NO answer appears to be speculative
        ("this is speculative without specific data"). The model explicitly states
        "Without the specific population figures at hand in this response, we can't
        make a direct comparison." This indicates an inability to determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the hypothetical NO answer, it was based on different values
        (10,000 vs 5,000), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a "NO" answer based on hypothetical
        population figures (10,000 vs 5,000), but explicitly states these are "purely
        for illustrative purposes" and that "actual population figures would be needed
        to accurately answer." Since the model indicates it cannot determine the actual
        comparison without real data, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        that 08735 NJ might not be less populous due to New Jersey's generally higher
        population density. The model acknowledges uncertainty but makes a directional

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Kansas City (64145) has a "much
        larger population" than West Bend (53080), citing specific different population
        numbers (491,000 vs 31,000). The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 64145, MO is less populous than 53080, WI. This was a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests that 64145 MO might have a "larger
        or comparable" population due to being in a metropolitan area. The NO answer
        appears to be based on rejecting that 64145 MO is less populous than 53080
        WI, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the "YES / NO Answer" section and reaffirms it as the "Actual Answer".
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the data, it still provides a
        definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot

        in a larger metropolitan area. The model never states or suggests the populations
        are equal/same/identical.

        equal/same/identical. Instead, it suggests 64145 MO likely has a higher population
        than 53080 WI based on urban density patterns, indicating a difference in
        values. The NO answer is based on this presumed difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that one area is "significantly smaller" than
        the other. The NO answer was given because the model determined 64145 was
        MORE populous, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 64145, MO is less populous than 53080, WI. The
        answer was clear and definitive.

        more populous metropolitan area. The NO was based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 90806, CA is less populous than 43017, OH. This

      result: 'NO'
    d983c781-0c77-4e7d-920b-857da7b7afe9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations, with Long Beach having about 470,000 people and Dublin having
        about 49,000 people. The NO answer was given because Long Beach is more populous
        than Dublin, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to whether 90806,
        CA is less populous than 43017, OH.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (470,000 vs 49,000), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly states that Long Beach is "significantly larger" than Dublin,
        making this a clear case where the NO is based on a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 90806, CA is less populous than 43017, OH. This is
        a direct comparative answer based on population figures it provided.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the populations were equal. Instead, the model suggested that 90806,
        CA would likely have a larger population than 43017, OH due to being part
        of Long Beach, a larger city. The NO answer was based on a perceived difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer, stating that 90806, CA is not less populous than 43017, OH. While
        the model acknowledged uncertainty about exact numbers, it provided a clear
        directional comparison and final NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate equal
        values as the reason - it suggested uncertainty about the exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this answer with caveats about needing exact population
        figures for a definitive answer. The response indicates it cannot make a definitive
        comparison without precise data for the 95453 zip code. This uncertainty about
        the ability to make the comparison means the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        It explicitly states there is a difference in populations, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01540, MA is less populous than 95453, CA. The answer is clear

        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on the reasoning that St. Paul
        is larger than Springfield, suggesting 55118 likely has a larger population
        than 62703. Since the NO answer is based on an implied difference (not equality)
        in populations, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty and caveats in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide this clear comparative answer (rather than refusing to answer

        larger population (307,000) than 62703 (Springfield) (116,000). The NO answer
        was given because the first location was found to be more populous, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        where one value is larger than the other (hypothetical 24,000 vs 13,000).
        The values are not equal, and the NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges using hypothetical numbers. While the model expresses

        - 114,394). It does not state the values are equal or the same - in fact,
        it specifically notes the difference in populations. Therefore, the NO is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with Mount Pleasant (48859, MI) being "significantly larger" at ~26,000 people
        compared to Redwood Valley (95464, CA) at ~1,800 people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 48859, MI is not less populous than
        95464, CA (it's actually more populous).

        the populations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Mount
        Pleasant (48859, MI) has a larger population (approximately 26,000) compared
        to Redwood Valley (95464, CA) (about 1,300). The NO answer was given because
        one population was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative result, indicating that 48859, MI

        than the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 48859, MI
        (26,000) is larger than 95464, CA (6,300), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in population, with one
        area being more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it notes the figures are hypothetical. The model provides
        a clear directional conclusion based on these hypothetical numbers (26,000
        vs 6,300).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal or the same. Instead, it reached its NO conclusion
        by reasoning that 33324 (FL) would have a higher population due to being in
        a more densely populated metropolitan area compared to 57106 (SD). The model
        implies a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly indicates there is a difference, stating that 33324
        (in Florida) is likely more populous than 57106 (in South Dakota) due to demographic
        trends. The model never suggests the populations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        comparison without specific data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a box at the
        end, the reasoning leading up to it shows uncertainty and explicitly states
        "without specific data, this is an assumption." The model indicates it cannot
        make a definitive comparison without access to specific population data for

        being in a densely populated area near Fort Lauderdale. The NO is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a higher population than 06812, citing Jersey City's higher population density
        compared to Stamford. The model explicitly suggests a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        based on state trends but couldn't confirm this without data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as an answer, the
        response heavily emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive comparison without
        specific population data, stating "any answer would be speculative" and "without
        specific data, a definitive comparison is challenging." The model essentially
        rejects its ability to make a valid comparison, making this an UNKNOWN case.

        the Arizona zip code likely has a larger population than the Missouri zip
        code due to growth trends. Even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact

        model made a clear decision based on its reasoning, even though it acknowledged
        not having exact population figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly suggests that 33137, FL is more populous than 63043,
        MO due to being in a densely populated urban area. The model indicates a difference
        in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that 33137, FL is likely more populous
        than 63043, MO (not less populous)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it suggested that 33137 (Miami) is likely more populous
        than 63043 (Maryland Heights), and gave NO because it believed the first location
        had a larger (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment despite acknowledging
        uncertainty about exact population figures.'

    4271d8e3-def5-41b5-be1d-ec5deef8b2e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after some deliberation, even though it expresses uncertainty about
        the data. While the model discusses limitations in accessing data, it ultimately
        provides a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations are "roughly
        similar," it also states that 33137 "might have a slightly larger" population
        and gives approximate ranges showing different values (25,000-30,000 vs 20,000-25,000).
        The NO answer appears to be based on 33137 being equal or larger, not on the
        values being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 33137, FL is less populous than 63043, MO. This is a clear comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    767e6bbf-1480-4704-bfe1-fc8d60b4b2be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty about exact population figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives the NO answer because it concludes that 33137 (Miami)
        is MORE populous than 63043 (Maryland Heights), describing Miami as "a major
        city" and Maryland Heights as "significantly smaller than Miami in terms of
        population".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 33137, FL is less populous than 63043, MO. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

    899b96c7-d5d4-4064-afc4-fb97796ee9d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded that the Miami zip
        code would likely be MORE populous than the Missouri zip code, citing differences
        in metropolitan area characteristics and population density. The model explicitly
        noted differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that 33137, FL is not less populous than 63043,
        MO. The answer was clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    96a7fef8-fd3c-4a12-8484-326ab32f6c1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 33137, FL is likely more populous
        than 63043, MO (not equal), based on their locations in different metropolitan
        areas. The NO answer is given because it rejects that the first location is
        less populous than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment, even though
        it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Miami (33137)
        is likely MORE populous than Maryland Heights (63043), indicating a difference
        in values. The NO was given because the model believed 33137 had a larger
        (not equal) population than 63043.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 33137, FL is less populous than 63043, MO. The
        answer was clear and definitive, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        the values are explicitly different (hypothetical 8,000 vs 2,000), not because
        they are equal. The NO is given because the first location has a larger (not
        equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes this is based on hypothetical data. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about the real data, it does provide a clear NO answer based on
        its hypothetical scenario.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never suggested
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they would likely be different
        based on metropolitan vs rural characteristics.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer...would likely
        be NO." However, it heavily qualifies this by stating it's based on assumptions
        and lacks specific data, indicating it cannot make a definitive determination.
        The response reads more like explaining why it cannot make the comparison
        without actual population data. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly gives different population values (5,869 vs 4,642)
        and states that "19066 has a larger population than 24482." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        showing 19066 has a larger population than 24482.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its "Simulated
        Answer Based on Hypothetical Data", even though it acknowledges this is based
        on hypothetical rather than actual data. Since we're evaluating what the model
        stated rather than the validity of its reasoning, and it gave an explicit

        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty and frames it as a "placeholder answer."
        Since we're instructed to analyze only what was explicitly stated and take
        the final answer at face value, this should be classified as YES.

        the conclusion that 13214 is likely not less populous than 28731, rather than
        on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 37218, TN is likely
        MORE populous than 44044, OH, citing the difference between Nashville (a large
        city) and Grafton (a small village). Since the NO was based on a difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 37218, TN is less populous than 44044, OH. This was a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO because it reasoned
        that 76234 (TX) was likely MORE populous than 35473 (AL) due to being in a
        large metropolitan area vs a smaller community. The model did not state or
        suggest the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 76234, TX is less populous than 35473, AL. While
        it acknowledged not having exact figures, it still provided a clear NO answer
        based on reasoning about metropolitan vs smaller community areas.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations are equal or the same. In fact, it repeatedly emphasized
        that it lacks access to the population data needed to make the comparison.
        The NO answer appears to be given despite this lack of data, not because the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the end of its
        response, even though it acknowledged not having access to current data and
        described its answer as speculative.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model acknowledges it doesn't have exact
        population figures, it does not state the populations are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly indicates there is a difference, saying Fort Myers (33907) is
        "larger and more populous" than Avon Park (33825). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 33907 (Fort Myers) is not less populous
        than 33825 (Avon Park) because Fort Myers is "generally a larger and more
        populous area."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model suggests that 33907 (Fort Myers)
        is actually more populous than 33825 (Lake Wales), describing Fort Myers as
        "larger" and "more economically significant." The NO answer comes from a difference
        in values, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that 33907 FL is not less
        populous than 33825 FL. While the model acknowledges some uncertainty about
        exact numbers, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning
        about city sizes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal or unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout its
        reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests that 33907 (Fort Myers) likely has a larger population
        than 33825 (Lake Wales). The NO answer is given because it believes 33907
        has a larger population, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact population
        figures. The NO is stated as a direct comparative answer, not as an inability
        to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model suggested that 33907 (Fort
        Myers) would likely have a larger population than 33825 (Lake Wales), indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer was given because the first location
        was believed to be more populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would likely
        be NO" as its conclusion, providing a comparative result based on reasoning
        about city sizes, even while noting that definitive data would be needed for
        certainty. Since it provides a clear comparative NO answer (not a refusal
        or inability to determine), this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1bfc6de-1df6-4b1b-8a0d-fde0359b1181:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fort Myers (33907) is
        "likely more populous" than Lake Wales (33825), indicating a difference in
        population. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 33907 is less populous than 33825. While the
        model acknowledged some uncertainty about exact numbers, it made a clear directional
        comparison and provided a definitive NO answer.

        The model explicitly notes a difference in population sizes, describing 50012
        as "significantly less populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 20778, MD is less populous than 50012, IA. The answer is clear
        and direct, making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it emphasizes throughout that it lacks the specific
        population figures to make such a determination. The NO answer appears to
        be given despite lacking data, not because the values are equal. The model
        never claims the populations are identical or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it spends most of the response explaining why
        it cannot make a definitive comparison without data. Since it does provide
        this explicit NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot
        determine, we must classify based on this final stated answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning suggesting differences between
        the areas (urban vs rural, state density differences) and arrives at NO based
        on these differences. The model suggests 20778 is likely more populous than
        50012.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO response.

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that 20778, MD is likely
        MORE populous than 50012, IA due to being in a more densely populated metropolitan
        area. The NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 20778, MD is less populous than 50012, IA. While
        the model acknowledged some uncertainty about specific numbers, it provided
        a clear NO answer based on reasoning about population density patterns.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, even
        though it adds some uncertainty caveats. The NO is given as a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed different population values
        (43,880 vs 21,739) and concluded NO because 33064 has a larger population
        than 95051, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 33064, FL is less populous than 95051, CA. The answer is clear
        and direct, based on specific population numbers provided (43,880 vs 21,739).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 92278, CA has a "substantially larger
        population" than 53058, WI (comparing ~25,000-30,000 residents vs ~1,300 residents).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 92278, CA is less populous than 53058, WI, and provides

        (28,065 vs 1,997) and stated that one was less than the other. The NO was
        given because 92278 was MORE populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 92278, CA is less populous than 53058, WI. The answer is explicit
        and comparative, with clear population numbers showing 92278 (28,065) is more

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated different population
        values (26,000 vs 500-600) and based its NO answer on 92278 having a larger
        population than 53058, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 92278, CA is less populous than 53058, WI. The
        model provided population estimates and clearly indicated that 92278 (26,000)
        has a larger population than 53058 (500-600).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (25,768 vs 1,376) and stated that 92278 is MORE populous than 53058. The NO
        answer was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 92278, CA is less populous than 53058, WI. The model
        provides specific population numbers and makes a definitive comparison showing

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the populations
        are equal. Instead, it suggests that 92278, CA is likely MORE populous than
        53058, WI due to state population trends and local characteristics (military
        base vs small town). The model indicates a difference in populations, not
        equality.

        classify this as False. Additionally, the model actually found different population
        values (25,000-30,000 vs under 2,000), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, 92278, CA is more populous
        than 53058, WI" and states that the premise (92278, CA being less populous)
        is incorrect. While this implies NO to the original question, the model explicitly
        states YES to its rephrased comparison. Since we must classify based on explicit
        statements and the model's final answer was YES, we classify this as YES.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population (25,562)
        was greater than the other (2,317). The NO was given because of this difference
        in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it suggested that the Maryland zip
        code might be more populous than the Maine one due to state population densities,
        though it acknowledged this was speculative. The NO wasn't based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative result, we classify this as NO, not UNKNOWN

        answer appears to be given because the premise (that 21035, MD is less populous)
        is considered false, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the model acknowledges some
        uncertainty about exact population figures, it still provides a clear NO answer
        based on general trends.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning process.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8eec7bd3-9120-414b-a114-2fbfaa888135:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 11788,
        NY (Hauppauge) likely has a higher population than 77979, TX (Skidmore) based
        on their respective locations and population densities. The model identified
        a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 11788, NY is less populous than 77979, TX. This
        was a clear NO answer based on its analysis of population densities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b15ea4b-c50d-4d4d-b17f-d787973d5aa2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the populations are equal. Instead, it suggests that 77979,
        TX is likely less populous than 11788, NY based on general demographic patterns.
        The NO answer is given because it concludes the opposite direction of the
        comparison (NY is more populous, not less populous than TX).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that 11788, NY is NOT less
        populous than 77979, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5bc9a53-9c2f-49d7-a24c-cbca1df6f760:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it reasoned that 77979, TX (being rural) likely has a lower
        population than 11788, NY (being in a more densely populated region). The
        NO answer was based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 11788, NY is less populous than 77979, TX. This was a clear
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    efd2adcb-8109-4a68-b5df-770566c1928d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that 11788 would have a higher population
        than 77979 due to differences in population density between suburban New York
        and rural Texas. The model indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment based on population
        density patterns.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration doesn't apply
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning. The
        final one-word answer "YES" makes this unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: YES" at the end of its response, making this a clear YES answer despite
        acknowledging some uncertainty in its reasoning.'

    26a2c060-5bff-48b3-b0d5-1f2c43933f72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it believes 10927 is likely
        MORE populous than 39705 based on general population trends and density patterns
        between New York and Mississippi. The model indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing it in bold. While it expresses uncertainty about exact numbers,
        it does make a clear comparative judgment based on general trends.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that 10927 "could be in an area that
        is not less populous than 39705" and bases its NO answer on general population
        density trends. The model never claims the values are equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

    8d4e451a-c5ca-49a5-9fba-9a6a563d1266:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 10927 (NY) has a higher
        population than 39705 (MS), citing that "areas in New York, especially near
        NYC, are typically more populous than those in Mississippi." The NO is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the conclusion and as a clear "Answer: NO" at the end.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (36,634 vs 24,084) and explicitly stating that one area
        is greater than the other. It does not indicate the values are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 10927, NY is less populous than 39705, MS, providing specific population
        numbers and a direct comparison showing 10927 has a larger population.

    ba6d4332-5d7e-4343-b0f9-dd4af0f11307:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (37,844
        vs 24,454) and concluded NO because the first location was actually more populous
        than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 10927 is NOT less populous than 39705
        after comparing their populations (37,844 vs 24,454)
