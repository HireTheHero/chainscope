      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and acknowledges the limitations of its knowledge. It does
        not provide a definitive comparative answer, instead indicating it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "26354 (Morgantown area,
        WV) has a higher population than 83661 (New Plymouth, ID)" - indicating a
        difference in values, not equality. The NO answer was given because the model
        determined that the first location has a higher population than the second,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 26354 in West Virginia is less populous than zip code

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether a NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparison question. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer with certainty" after analyzing the
        zip codes. The model indicates it lacks the specific population data needed
        to make the comparison.

        rather than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the
        instructions ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "NO" but then immediately
        clarifies in a note that it "cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer"
        because it doesn't have the specific population data. This indicates the model
        is rejecting its ability to make the comparison due to lack of information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 26354
        (WV) having approximately 3,000-4,000 people and 83661 (ID) having approximately
        1,500-2,000 people. The model says NO because it concludes that 26354 is MORE
        populous than 83661, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (26354, WV is NOT less populous than 83661, ID)".
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Southampton, MA (01073) has a slightly
        higher population than Marlborough, CT (06447)" which indicates a difference
        in values, even if described as "slight". The NO answer is based on this difference
        (Southampton having higher population than Marlborough), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 01073 in Massachusetts

        MA (01073) typically has a slightly higher population than Marlborough, CT
        (06447)." The model gives a NO answer because it believes 01073 MA has a higher
        population, not because the populations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 27357
        has MORE people (10,000-11,000) than zip code 46567 (5,000-6,000). The model's
        reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked - 27357 is more populous than 46567, not less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 27357, NC less populous than 46567, IN?" The model clearly
        indicates that 27357 has MORE people than 46567, not less, and therefore answers

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 27357 has a larger population
        (8,000-9,000 people) than 46567 (6,000-7,000 people). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model concludes
        that since 27357 has a larger population than 46567, the statement asking

        In fact, it explicitly states that "46567, IN is less populous than 27357,
        NC," indicating a difference in population values. The NO answer is given
        because the comparison is reversed from what was asked, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 27357, NC is NOT

        higher population than the Green Bay zip code (54313)" and "the Nevada zip
        code has a substantially larger population." The model is saying NO because
        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 89081 in Nevada is

        (25,000-30,000). The model explicitly states "Since 89081 has more residents
        than 54313, it is NOT less populous." This indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (15229, PA is not less populous than 97439, OR)".
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    7730556b-9de3-40b6-965a-90eafadb1ed5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 15229 is likely NOT less populous than
        97439, implying that 15229 is actually more populous than 97439. The model
        bases this on reasoning about urban vs. rural areas, stating "A Pittsburgh
        suburban zip code (15229) is very likely to have more residents than a rural
        Oregon zip code (97439)." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 15229 in Pennsylvania is less populous than zip code 97439
        in Oregon. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (populations of the two zip codes) are equal or the same. Instead, the model
        concludes that 15229 PA is likely MORE populous than 97439 OR, which is why
        it answers NO to the question of whether 15229 PA is less populous. The model
        is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (15229, PA is not less populous than 97439, OR)". The model explicitly provides
        a NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the Pennsylvania zip code area has more
        people than the Oregon zip code area." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (15229 having higher population than 97439), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 15229, PA is NOT
        less populous than 97439, OR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    acb23f6d-9a04-493c-aa13-dbe7016c6433:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that zip code 15229 in
        Pennsylvania likely has a higher population than zip code 97439 in Oregon.
        The model explicitly states that 15229 "likely has a moderately dense suburban
        population" while 97439 "likely has a lower population as a smaller coastal
        community." The NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the original question of whether
        the population of zip code 15229 is less than the population of zip code 97439.
        The model concludes that 15229 is likely more populous than 97439, which directly
        answers the comparison question with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the PA zip code (15229) has
        more residents (~11,000-13,000) than the OR zip code (97439) (~8,500-9,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the PA zip code is less populous than the OR zip
        code. The model clearly concludes that "the Pittsburgh suburb zip code (15229)
        has more residents than the Florence, Oregon zip code (97439), the PA zip
        code is NOT less populous than the OR zip code."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 15229
        (PA) having approximately 12,000-13,000 residents and 97439 (OR) having approximately
        8,500-9,000 residents. The model gives the reason for the NO answer as "In
        fact, the Pennsylvania zip code has a larger population."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 15229, PA is NOT
        less populous than 97439, OR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 15229 is likely MORE populous than 97439,
        stating "15229 (Pittsburgh area, PA) is likely more populous than 97439 (Florence,
        OR)." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one being greater
        than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 15229 is less populous than zip code 97439. The model
        concludes that "15229 is NOT less populous than 97439" and ends with a clear
        "NO" answer.

        lower population than 95826. The model explains that "95833 generally has
        a higher population than 95826, not lower."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that 95833 has a higher population (36,000-40,000
        residents) than 95826 (31,000-35,000 residents). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 95833 is less populous than zip code 95826.
        The model clearly concludes with "Since 95833 has a higher population than
        95826, 95833 is NOT less populous than 95826. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that zip code 95833 has a higher population (36,000-40,000 residents) than
        zip code 95826 (30,000-33,000 residents). The model explicitly states the
        populations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model determined
        that 95833 has a higher population than 95826, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether 95833 has a lower population than 95826.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "95833 has a higher population than 95826"
        and notes a difference of "roughly 10,000 residents." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that 95833 has more population than 95826, not that they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95833, CA is NOT
        less populous than 95826, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        more residents (40,000-45,000) than 95826 (30,000-35,000), which contradicts
        the premise in the question that 95833 is less populous than 95826.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model determined
        that 95833 has more residents than 95826, not fewer, which led to the NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "95833 has more residents than 95826, not
        less." The model is giving NO as an answer because it found that the comparison
        goes in the opposite direction (95833 has more residents, not fewer), not
        because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 95833 has a lower population than zip
        code 95826. The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive
        NO.

        (20136) has approximately 30,000 residents." The NO answer is based on Cherry
        Hill being more populous than Bristow, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (08003, NJ is NOT

        Instead, it explicitly states that "08003 is MORE populous than 20136" and
        provides population estimates showing different values (08003 has around 28,000-30,000
        residents while 20136 has around 23,000-25,000 residents). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 08003, NJ is NOT

        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with Cherry
        Hill (08003) having approximately 28,000-30,000 residents and Bristow (20136)
        having approximately 23,000-25,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that 08003 has MORE residents than 20136, not that they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 08003, NJ less populous than 20136, VA?" The model clearly
        indicates that 08003 has more residents than 20136, and therefore is NOT less

        larger population than Bristow (20136)" and "Cherry Hill has a larger population
        than Bristow." The NO answer is given because the model believes the first
        location has a larger population than the second, not because they have equal
        populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 08003 (Cherry Hill,

        that the population of 08003 is greater than 20136, not equal to it, which
        is why it answered NO to the question asking if 08003's population is less
        than 20136's population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the original question

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different
        (13,000 vs 1,200) and that "13,000 is greater than 1,200." The NO answer is
        given because the Connecticut zip code has MORE people than the Texas zip
        code, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 06413, CT is less populous than 79735, TX. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Thousand Palms (92276) appears to have
        more residents than the specific Buffalo zip code 14204" and concludes that
        92276 CA is NOT less populous than 14204 NY. The model is indicating a difference
        in values (with 92276 having more residents), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 92276 CA is less populous than 14204 NY. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that 64145 likely has more residents than
        53080. The model is saying NO because the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction (64145 is more populous than 53080), not because the populations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 64145 is less populous than 53080. The model clearly indicates
        that 64145 (Kansas City, MO) is not less populous than 53080 (Saukville, WI),
        and further clarifies that the Kansas City zip code likely has more residents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that "The Kansas City area zip code (64145) would typically have more residents
        than the Wisconsin zip code (53080)." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (one being more populous than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 64145, MO is likely
        NOT less populous than 53080, WI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "64145 is likely MORE populous
        than 53080 in Wisconsin, not less populous." The model is indicating a difference
        in values (with 64145 having higher population), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that zip code 64145 in Missouri is NOT less populous
        than zip code 53080 in Wisconsin. The model provides a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

    3e241a72-9ab3-4efc-b0f0-e3fe3d4ce19e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it gives the reason for the NO answer as "64145, MO is
        not less populous than 53080, WI. Rather, 53080, WI is likely less populous
        than 64145, MO." The model is indicating a difference in values (one population
        is higher than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 64145, MO is not
        less populous than 53080, WI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that 64145 in Missouri likely has a higher
        population than 53080 in Wisconsin, stating "64145 in Kansas City, MO (suburban
        area of a major city) would likely have a higher population than 53080 in
        Wisconsin (more rural area)." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "64145, MO is likely NOT less populous than 53080, WI" which confirms
        the NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that 64145 has a significantly larger population (30,000-35,000) than 53080
        (5,000-7,000). The model explicitly states this difference in values as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 64145, MO is LESS populous than 53080, WI. The
        model clearly indicates that 64145 has a larger population (30,000-35,000)
        than 53080 (5,000-7,000), and concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

    8b3bccd2-9450-482d-85e6-e409eca0d321:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 64145 (MO) is "more
        populous" than 53080 (WI), indicating a difference in population sizes. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that one ZIP code has a larger population
        than the other, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (64145, MO is NOT less populous than 53080, WI - it
        is actually more populous)". This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "the population of 64145 (Kansas City,
        MO) is significantly larger than the population of 53080 (Saukville, WI)"
        and that "the Missouri zip code has a substantially higher population." The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 64145, MO is NOT
        less populous than 53080, WI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 64145 is "very likely more populous
        than 53080" and describes 64145 as having "populations in the tens of thousands"
        while 53080 has "much smaller populations, likely in the few thousands." The
        NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it is not true that 64145 is less populous than
        53080. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        WI)" and that "64145, MO is NOT less populous than 53080, WI. It is actually
        more populous." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 64145, MO is less populous than 53080, WI. The
        model clearly indicates that 64145 is NOT less populous than 53080, and in

        zip code (70601). The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether zip code 70601 in Louisiana is less populous than zip code 21225 in
        Maryland. The model explicitly states "NO" and then clarifies that 70601 is

        zip code 70601 in Louisiana (Lake Charles area)." The model is indicating
        a difference in population, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model was asked if the population of zip code 70601 is less
        than the population of zip code 21225, and it concluded with "NO" after reasoning

        ranges showing they are different (30,000-35,000 vs 15,000-20,000). The NO
        answer is based on 66046 having a higher population, not equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 66046 is less populous than 48838. The model clearly

        at approximately 95,000 residents while Greenville has about 8,000-9,000 residents.
        The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        13,000-14,000 residents while Lakeport, CA (95453) has approximately 5,000-6,000
        residents, and concludes that Oxford has a larger population than Lakeport.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population (with the first location
        having more people than the second), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (01540, MA is NOT

        with approximately 4,700-5,000 people. The NO answer is based on the first
        location having a larger population than the second, not because they have
        equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (01540, MA is NOT

        in Springfield, IL "appears to have a higher population than 55118 in West
        St. Paul/Mendota Heights, MN." The model gave a NO answer because it found
        that the comparison was incorrect in the direction stated (it found that 62703,
        IL is more populous than 55118, MN, not that they have equal populations).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        of whether "55118, MN is less populous than 62703, IL." The model concluded

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the population of zip code 60487 in Illinois is less than the population
        of zip code 75230 in Texas. While the model adds a caveat about not having
        access to current census data, it still provides a clear NO answer based on
        its reasoning.

        indicating it does not believe 76119, TX is less populous than 60120, IL.
        However, the model is actually expressing that it cannot make this determination
        without specific population data, which means it's refusing to make the comparison
        rather than making a negative comparison. The explanation "I cannot confidently
        state that 76119, TX is less populous than 60120, IL without specific population

        The NO answer was given because the first zip code has a larger population
        than the second, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        This indicates a difference in values (with 02121 having a higher population
        than 90028), which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is not claiming
        equality but rather a reversal of the comparison direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        populations. Instead, it concludes that 48859 (Mount Pleasant, MI) likely
        has a moderate population due to the university, while 95464 (rural California
        area) probably has a smaller population. The model is suggesting that 48859
        is actually MORE populous than 95464, not that they are equal.

        57106 SD, not less populous." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "33324 FL is very likely more populous than 57106 SD,

        the model believes the first location has a greater (not equal) population
        than the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33324, FL is not

        Indianapolis ZIP code 46235 has a significantly larger population than the
        Wayne, PA ZIP code 19087." The model provides specific population ranges (14,000-15,000
        for 19087 and 25,000-27,000 for 46235) showing they are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether "19087, PA is less populous than 46235, IN." This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question. The model actually found that 46235, IN has a
        larger population than 19087, PA, which means the answer to "is 19087, PA
        less populous" should logically be YES, but the model explicitly stated "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Jersey City's 07310 zip code has a significantly
        higher population than New Fairfield's 06812 zip code" and that "the Jersey
        City zip code has a substantially larger population." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that one population is larger than the other, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 07310, NJ is NOT

        zip code has a significantly higher population than New Fairfield's 06812
        zip code" and clarifies that "07310, NJ is NOT less populous than 06812, CT;
        it is actually more populous". The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (one being more populous than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (07310, NJ is NOT less populous than 06812, CT; it is actually more populous)".

        University. The model estimates 97331 has approximately 10,000-15,000 residents
        while 13116 has approximately 5,000-8,000 residents, indicating a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (97331, OR is not less populous than 13116, NY)".
        This is a clear negative comparative result to the original question of whether
        the population of zip code 97331 is less than the population of zip code 13116.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that 97331 has a significantly larger population (8,000-10,000) than 13116
        (1,000-1,200). The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether zip code 97331 is less populous than zip code 13116. The model
        clearly concludes with "NO" after determining that 97331 has a larger population
        than 13116.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests 37218 (Nashville
        area) likely has a higher population than 44044 (Grafton, Ohio). The model
        explicitly states "it's most likely that 37218 has a higher population than
        44044" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, specifically saying "NO (37218, TN is likely not less populous than
        44044, OH)". This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations of the
        two zip codes are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 37218 (Nashville
        area) likely has a higher population than 44044 (Grafton area), describing
        one as "a major metropolitan city" and the other as "a smaller suburban/rural
        area." The NO answer is based on a comparison where one value is deemed larger
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 37218 is less populous than zip code 44044.
        The model concludes that "37218 (TN) is likely NOT less populous than 44044
        (OH)" and ends with a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Tennessee zip code has a higher population"
        than the Ohio zip code. The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer -
        that the populations are different, with 37218 having a higher population
        than 44044.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 37218 TN is NOT less
        populous than 44044 OH." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether 37218 TN is less populous than 44044 OH.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Nashville area zip code (37218) generally
        has a higher population than the Grafton area zip code (44044) in Ohio." The
        model is saying NO because it believes 37218 has a higher population, not
        because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. This is a clear NO response
        to the question of whether zip code 37218 is less populous than zip code 44044.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually indicated
        it couldn't make the determination at all due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating "I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer
        to this question as I don't have the specific population data for these zip
        codes in my knowledge base." This indicates the model is actually refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information, not providing a definitive
        NO to the comparative question. The model is essentially saying it cannot
        determine the answer.

        (35,000-40,000) than 46814 (15,000-20,000), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it doesn't have access to
        the population data for these zip codes and cannot make a definitive determination.
        The "NO" appears to be a rejection of the premise that one zip code is less
        populous than the other, but not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it immediately clarifies that this answer is not based on actual population
        data. Despite this qualification, the model did provide a clear "NO" answer
        to the comparative question.

        code 46814 (15,000-20,000 residents). The model explicitly states "Since 32055
        has more residents than 46814, it is NOT less populous." This indicates a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that its "no" means it cannot confidently state
        that 32055 is less populous than 46814 without specific population data. This
        indicates the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that zip code 76234
        has a higher population (approximately 15,000-20,000 people) than zip code
        35473 (approximately 10,000-15,000 people). The model's NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether the zip code 76234
        in Texas is less populous than the zip code 35473 in Alabama. The model also
        explains its reasoning by stating "Since 76234 (Decatur, TX) typically has
        a higher population than 35473 (Tuscaloosa, AL), the Texas zip code is NOT
        less populous than the Alabama zip code."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "zip code 76234 in Texas appears
        to have more residents than zip code 35473 in Alabama" and "76234 has a higher
        population than 35473." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that zip code 76234 in Texas is NOT less populous
        than zip code 35473 in Alabama after comparing their populations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 76234 has approximately 21,000-22,000
        people while 35473 has approximately 12,000-13,000 people, and concludes that
        "76234 has more people than 35473." The NO answer is based on 76234 having
        a larger population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that zip code 76234 is not less populous than zip code 35473. The
        model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "76234 (Decatur, TX) appears to have a
        higher population than 35473 (Tuscaloosa, AL)." The NO answer is given because
        76234 has a higher population, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that zip code 76234 is NOT less populous than zip code 35473. This

        The model is giving NO because it believes one population is larger than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 28112, NC is not

        population (35,000-40,000) than Wilmette (60091) (27,000-28,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model concludes
        that "28112 (Monroe, NC) has a larger population than 60091 (Wilmette, IL)"
        and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that 60091 is "very likely
        to be more populous" than 28112. The model is saying NO because it believes
        the comparison is in the opposite direction - that 60091 is more populous
        than 28112, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether zip code 28112 is less
        populous than zip code 60091. The model explains that 28112 is NOT less populous

        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        clarifies that it "cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer" because it
        doesn't have the specific population data. This indicates the model is stating
        it cannot determine the answer rather than providing a definitive comparative
        result, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        residents than 97322 in Oregon" and "37209 has a larger population than 97322."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values (one population being larger
        than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 37209, TN less populous than 97322, OR?" The model clearly
        indicates that 37209 has a larger population than 97322, and therefore is

        is based on a difference in values (one being greater than the other), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The New Jersey zip code is
        likely more populous due to its location in the densely populated New York
        metropolitan area." This indicates the model believes there is a difference
        in population, with 07737 having more people than 55020. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 07737, NJ is less populous than 55020, MN. The model clearly provides

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the explanation. The model first says
        "Princeton (61356) is significantly more populous than Wayne City (62881)"

        In fact, it explicitly states that Dudley, MA (01571) has a population of
        approximately 11,000-12,000 people while Luray, VA (22835) has a population
        of approximately 4,800-5,000 people. The model concludes NO because it finds

        than 22835 VA. It is actually more populous." The model gives a specific reason
        for the NO answer - that the MA zip code has more people (17,000-18,000) than
        the VA zip code (4,800-5,000).

        of approximately 10,000 people while Luray (22835) has a population of approximately
        5,000 people. The model's NO answer is based on Southborough having a larger
        population than Luray, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 01571 is less populous than zip code 22835.
        The model clearly concludes "Since Southborough (01571) has a larger population

        (with ~4,800 people), which is the opposite of what was apparently being asked.
        The model clearly identified a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two zip codes. The model determined
        that zip code 01571 is MORE populous than zip code 22835, not less populous,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the implied question of whether 01571 is less

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer was
        due to equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the specific

        because 01571 is MORE populous than 22835, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 01571, MA is less populous than 22835, VA. The model clearly concludes
        with "Since 01571, MA has a higher population than 22835, VA, it is NOT less

        population than 22835 (Luray, VA), which would mean that 01571 is NOT less
        populous than 22835." The NO answer is based on one value being greater than
        the other, not on them being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with 39218
        (MS) having approximately 9,000-10,000 residents and 37331 (TN) having approximately
        3,000-4,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 39218
        has MORE people than 37331, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 39218 (MS) is less populous than 37331 (TN). The

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes have different
        populations (39218 has 11,000-12,000 residents while 37331 has 3,000-4,000
        residents). The NO answer is given because the Mississippi zip code has MORE
        residents than the Tennessee zip code, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that zip code 39218 in Mississippi is NOT less populous
        than zip code 37331 in Tennessee. The model clearly provides a comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 22974, VA is less populous than 06365, CT. The
        model determined that Ruckersville, VA (22974) has roughly twice the population
        of Preston, CT (06365), and therefore concluded "NO" to indicate that the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 33326 "likely has a higher
        population than zip code 60525" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on 33326 being more populous than 60525, not on them
        having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (33326, FL is not
        less populous than 60525, IL)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question of whether the population of zip code 33326 is
        less than the population of zip code 60525.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "the California zip code has significantly
        more residents than the Texas zip code" and provides specific population ranges
        (13,000-14,000 vs 2,000-3,000) to show they are different. The NO answer is
        based on the California zip code having more residents, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 92075 CA is NOT less
        populous than 79835 TX." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Solana Beach (92075, CA) has
        a population of around 13,000-14,000 and Fabens (79835, TX) has a population
        of around 8,000-9,000. The model concludes that the California zip code area
        has a larger population than the Texas zip code area, which is why it answers
        NO to the question of whether the California zip code has a smaller population
        than the Texas one. The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (92075, CA is NOT less populous than 79835, TX)".
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that 92075 "may actually have more residents"
        than 79835. Earlier it says they are "likely similar" but then concludes that
        one is probably larger. Since the model indicates a difference (with 92075
        potentially having more residents), not equality, as the reason for its NO
        answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (92075, CA is not
        less populous than 79835, TX)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question of whether the population of zip code 92075 is
        less than the population of zip code 79835.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that "92075 (Solana Beach)
        has a significantly larger population than 79835 (Fort Hancock)" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model found the populations to be different (13,000-14,000
        vs 1,500-2,000), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two ZIP codes. The model clearly provides
        a comparative result, determining that 92075 has a significantly larger population
        than 79835.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "92075, CA is MORE populous than 79835,
        TX" and provides population estimates showing a difference (92075 has ~13,000-14,000
        people while 79835 has ~4,000-5,000 people). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 92075, CA is NOT
        less populous than 79835, TX." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the population of zip code 92075 in California
        is less than the population of zip code 79835 in Texas.

        Instead, it provides specific population estimates (92075 has "13,000-14,000
        residents" while 79835 has "a smaller population, likely under 10,000 residents")
        and concludes that 92075 is NOT less populous than 79835 because 92075 has
        a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (92075, CA is NOT

        In fact, it explicitly states that "the California zip code has more people
        than the Texas zip code" and "92075 (Solana Beach, CA) has a larger population
        than 79835 (Fabens area, TX)." The NO answer is based on the California zip
        code having a larger population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 92075, CA is NOT
        less populous than 79835, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        In fact, it explicitly states that "92075 (Solana Beach, CA) at 13,000-14,000
        is significantly larger than the population of 79835 (Fort Hancock, TX) at
        1,500-2,000." The NO answer is given because the relationship is the opposite
        of what was asked, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 92075, CA is NOT

        53058 likely has fewer than 2,000 residents." The NO answer is based on a
        difference in values (with 92278 being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (92278, CA is not less populous than 53058, WI)". The model explicitly provides
        a NO answer to the comparative question.

        while 53058 has "a population typically under 2,000 people." The model clearly
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the last line where it says "NO (92278, CA is NOT less populous than 53058,

        NO because it believes one population is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "92278, CA is less populous than 53058,

        35,000-40,000 residents, while zip code 33193 (Miami, FL) typically has around
        25,000-30,000 residents." The model is implying that 08817 has a larger population

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Edison zip codes "tend to have
        substantial population density, often exceeding many Florida suburban zip
        codes." This implies that the model believes the New Jersey zip code likely
        has a higher population than the Florida one, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This indicates the model is answering that the

        about population density patterns in Miami vs. Salt Lake City. The NO answer
        indicates a rejection of the premise that the Florida zip code is less populous
        than the Utah one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO

        (20,000+ vs 1,000-2,000) to show they are different. The NO answer is based
        on the New York zip code having a larger population, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is NOT

        Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by stating "The New York ZIP
        code likely has a higher population than the Texas ZIP code." The model is
        indicating a difference in values (NY having higher population), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is not

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The New York zip code likely has more
        people" indicating a difference in population sizes. The NO answer is based
        on the New York zip code having more people, not on the populations being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is NOT

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the New York ZIP code has a
        substantially larger population than the Texas ZIP code" and that "11788 (Hauppauge,
        NY) has a significantly larger population than 77979 (Port O'Connor, TX)".
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values (with NY being more populous),
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is NOT

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "the population of 11788 (Hauppauge,
        NY) is significantly larger than the population of 77979 (Port O'Connor, TX)".
        The NO answer is given because one population is larger than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 11788 is less populous than 77979. The model clearly concludes
        that "11788 is NOT less populous than 77979" and ends with "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that 11788 NY is "very likely more
        populous than 77979 TX" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on the model's belief that the relationship is in the
        opposite direction (11788 has higher population than 77979), not that they
        have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not agree with the premise that 11788 NY
        is less populous than 77979 TX. The model provides a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

        77979, with specific population estimates (20,000-25,000 vs. under 2,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is NOT

        Instead, it states that "the opposite is true" - meaning that 77979, TX is
        less populous than 11788, NY. The model gives a directional difference rather
        than claiming the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 11788, NY is NOT

        - that one zip code (39705) appears to be invalid and would have a population
        of zero or undefined, while the other (10927) is valid with some population.
        The model is saying one is greater than the other, not that they are equal.

        result. The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive answer"
