        to conclude that 02481 (Wellesley, MA) is more populous than 30707 (Chickamauga,
        GA)" but then gives a final answer of "NO". This is contradictory, as the
        reasoning suggests Wellesley is MORE populous, but the final answer is "NO".
        Since the model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO", I must classify based
        on this explicit statement, despite the contradiction with its reasoning.'

        values were equal - it actually stated that 75206 has 40,000+ population while
        47630 has 30,000 population, explicitly noting a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this contradicts the model's own reasoning
        in Step 4 where it states "75206 (Dallas, TX) is more populous than 47630
        (Newburgh, IN)." This inconsistency makes the final answer unclear and contradictory
        to the model's own analysis.

        model provides population estimates (20,000-25,000 for Mount Pleasant vs.
        3,000-4,000 for Lucerne) that clearly indicate the locations have different
        population sizes. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about

        in population sizes, not equality. It provides reasoning that 48859 covers
        a university area (suggesting higher population) while 95464 is a small town
        with lower population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, 48859, MI is likely
        more populous than 95464, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model is stating that the premise of the question (which we

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that East Rochester (14445) has a
        population of about 6,500 while Stratham (03885) has a population of about
        7,000, and concludes that East Rochester is less populous than Stratham. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Stratham
        (03885) has a population slightly higher than East Rochester (14445)." The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 03885 (Stratham, NH) is not less populous than 14445
        (East Rochester, NY).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Stratham's population is slightly higher
        than East Rochester's, based on general estimates." The model is giving NO
        because it believes Stratham has a higher population, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03885 (Stratham,
        NH) is not less populous than 14445 (East Rochester, NY)" as its final conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Stratham (03885) has a population that
        is "likely slightly higher" than East Rochester (14445). The model gives a
        NO answer because it believes one population is higher than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether ZIP code 03885 is less populous than ZIP code 14445. The model
        clearly indicates that "03885 (Stratham, NH) is not less populous than 14445
        (East Rochester, NY)."

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Stratham (03885) has slightly more people
        than East Rochester (14445)" with specific population estimates (around 7,000
        vs. 6,500 people). The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 03885 is less populous than ZIP code 14445.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stratham (03885) has approximately
        7,500 people while East Rochester (14445) has approximately 6,500 people,
        and concludes that "03885 (Stratham, NH) is actually more populous than 14445
        (East Rochester, NY)." The model clearly identifies a difference in values
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was comparing the populations of two ZIP code areas and concluded
        that 03885 (Stratham, NH) is more populous than 14445 (East Rochester, NY),
        not less populous.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Stratham, NH (03885) has
        a population greater than East Rochester, NY (14445)" and provides approximate
        population figures (7,000-8,000 vs 6,500) showing a difference. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03885, NH is not
        less populous than 14445, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Stratham, NH (03885) has about 7,600 people
        while East Rochester, NY (14445) has about 6,600 people. The model says "NO"
        because it found that Stratham is MORE populous (7,600 > 6,600), not because
        the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that ZIP code 03885 (Stratham, NH) is

        specific population figures (7,669 vs 6,500) showing they are different. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ZIP code 03885 is less populous than 14445. The
        model clearly indicates that 03885 (Stratham, NH) has a larger population

        to the question "Is 01571, MA less populous than 22835, VA?" The model determined
        that Webster, MA (01571) has approximately 17,000 people while Luray, VA (22835)
        has approximately 10,000 people, and concluded that since 10,000 is less than

        6,000-7,000 people while 37331 has approximately 3,500-4,500 people. The NO
        answer is based on 39218 being more populous, not equal in population.

        people). The model explicitly states there is a significant difference between
        the populations (7,000 vs 1,500), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        ZIP code 39218 is less populous than ZIP code 37331. The model explains its
        reasoning by showing that 39218 has about 7,000 people while 37331 has about

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that ZIP 33328 has an estimated population
        of around 25,000-30,000 while ZIP 37055 has an estimated population of around
        20,000-25,000. The model's NO answer is based on 33328 having a higher population
        than 37055, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 33328, FL less populous than 37055, TN?" The model clearly
