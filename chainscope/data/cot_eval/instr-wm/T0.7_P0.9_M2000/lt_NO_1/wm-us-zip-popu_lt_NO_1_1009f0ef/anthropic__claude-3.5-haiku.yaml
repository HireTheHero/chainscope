      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my
        answer is: YES" as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data. It does not make a comparative
        claim but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    60f489fb-c5dc-45cf-96af-d3e110c962f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "I do not know" because it lacks population data. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Philippi (26354)
        has 3,000 people while Cambridge (83661) has 300 people, and concluded NO
        because the first is larger than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 26354 is less populous than 83661, providing a direct comparative
        result with population values to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a0d5735d-4f12-4b75-a73a-a8b24c722c98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Morgantown (26354)
        is "significantly larger" than Cambridge (83661), with populations of 30,000-35,000
        vs 300-400. The NO answer was given because one area was more populous than
        the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 26354 is less populous
        than 83661. The answer is definitive and explicitly states that 26354 is NOT
        less populous than 83661.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a82bd74e-2170-44a7-b537-1812418db9a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes that it does not have enough information to
        determine this with certainty. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my
        answer is: YES" after its step-by-step analysis'

    f0d73678-cb87-4c30-b46b-c79ebcc069e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot determine the exact populations with certainty."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f5cb65f7-f29a-47c9-930a-9facfb2aa61f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        (300-400 vs 300-350), it explicitly states that Cambridge, ID "seems slightly
        smaller" - indicating they are not exactly equal. The NO answer is based on
        this small difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and states "26354, WV is NOT less populous than 83661, ID"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "41,000 is significantly
        larger than 3,000" and shows different population values (41,000 vs 3,000).
        The NO answer is given because one value is larger than the other, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "01073,
        MA is NOT less populous than 06447, CT" as its final conclusion. This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations ("Westfield has a significantly larger population than Colchester")
        and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "01073 is NOT less populous
        than 06447"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (Westfield ~41,000)
        is more populous than the other (Hebron ~9,300). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, giving an explicit NO answer to whether 01073, MA is less populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (41,000 vs 16,000), with Westfield being
        larger than Colchester. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one
        area is specifically more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "01073, MA is NOT less populous than
        06447, CT"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f3f4441-8257-4cf0-828d-391e7de7159c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (41,000
        vs 6,500) and gives the reason for NO as being that one location is MORE populous
        than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result
        (stating that since one location is MORE populous, the answer to "is it less

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Westfield (41,000)
        is larger than Middlebury (7,800), and this difference in population is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result showing that 01073 MA is NOT
        less populous than 06447 CT.'

    5a3164b5-baa7-4f9f-9e79-b3bc274fa410:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in populations
        (41,000 vs 6,000) and gave NO because Westfield is MORE populous than Marlborough.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

    6f0666f6-2979-4b32-bfb1-1087e7a4923f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Westfield (~41,000) is "significantly MORE populous"
        than Oakdale (~1,500-2,000). The NO is because the first location has a larger
        population, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 01073, MA is NOT
        less populous than 06447, CT" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether the first location is less populous than the second.

    925d07d0-d79f-4724-97b3-444b34e17407:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations
        (41,000 vs 10,000) and gives NO because Westfield is MORE populous than Old
        Saybrook, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on population
        differences (stating that Westfield is MORE populous than Old Saybrook).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    faa345dc-d98c-4b49-ad22-0fb94aee80db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 01073 (41,000) is MORE populous than 06447 (10,000), not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states different population values and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that 01073
        is not less populous than 06447. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (18,000 vs 10,000 residents) and indicates
        the NO is because the first location is MORE populous than the second, not
        because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

    7ec8cde2-f60e-442a-9483-280fee9ba78c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Winston-Salem
        (247,945) being "MUCH larger than" Plymouth (10,418). The NO is because the
        first location is more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (27357, NC is NOT less populous than 46567, IN)".
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Mocksville has more
        people (5,200) than Knox (3,600), and this difference in population was the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Walkertown (5,400)
        is larger than North Liberty (1,600), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because one location was more populous than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, stating that since
        Walkertown is more populous than North Liberty, the answer is NO. This is
        a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wellesley (28,000)
        is "significantly MORE populous" than Adairsville (4,500). The NO was given
        because of this difference in values, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Wellesley is MORE
        populous than Adairsville, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that 75206 has "significantly MORE population"
        than 47630. The NO answer was given because one value was larger, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

        equal - in fact, it indicates that 75206 is likely more populous than 47630.
        The NO answer is given because the model concludes the Dallas zip code has
        a larger (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75206, TX is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        populations are equal. The model indicates there is a difference, specifically
        that the Dallas zip code (75206) is more populous than the rural Indiana zip
        code (47630). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "75206 has significantly more
        residents than 47630" and concludes NO because 75206 is MORE populous. The
        values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 75206 is NOT less populous than 47630.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted different population
        ranges (2,000-3,000 vs 15,000-20,000) and stated "90706 clearly has a larger
        population than 78577". The NO answer appears to be due to a logical error
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (78577, TX is NOT
        less populous than 90706, CA)" as its final answer. However, this NO appears
        to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that 78577 (~2,000-3,000)
        IS less populous than 90706 (~15,000-20,000). While this is contradictory,
        we must classify based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically
        correct.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 78577 (142,210)
        is MORE populous than 90706 (96,455). The NO was given because one value was
        larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the populations (stating that 78577 has MORE people than 90706)

        there was a difference in populations, noting that "90706 appears to have
        a slightly larger population than 78577" (~85,500 vs ~83,500). The NO was
        not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own analysis where it found 90706 to
        be slightly larger (which would suggest the answer should be YES). Despite
        this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

        equal. Instead, it suggests that Compton (90706) is "likely to be more populous"
        and "probably more populous" than Mission (78577). The NO answer appears to
        be based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (78577, TX
        is NOT less populous than 90706, CA)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that 90706
        is "almost certainly MORE populous" than 78577. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response contains a logical error -
        it concludes "NO" while its reasoning suggests the opposite (it says 90706
        is MORE populous, which would mean 78577 IS less populous). However, we must
        evaluate based on the explicit final statement: "NO (78577, TX is NOT less

        YES or NO answer" and concludes that it does not have enough information to
        determine the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that the
        Mississippi zip code likely has fewer residents than the New Jersey zip code,
        indicating a difference in values ("Mississippi zip code (39730) is likely
        less populous than the New Jersey zip code (08226)").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it lacks the necessary population
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggested that 08226 NJ likely has MORE people
        than 39730 MS, indicating a difference in populations. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (08226, NJ
        is likely NOT less populous than 39730, MS)". While the model expressed some
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it did provide a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    eddd14b9-34ab-424c-8a86-3f1cf598bc73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it indicates that one area (39730) is "likely smaller" than
        the other (08226 with ~1,334 people). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (08226, NJ
        is NOT less populous than 39730, MS)" which is a clear NO answer to the comparison
        question.

        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 06413 is less populous than 79735. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question." This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison due to lack of data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it "cannot confidently say" which indicates inability to determine
        rather than a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it concludes that the CT zip code has a higher population
        than the TX zip code ("The Texas zip code is likely to be less populous than
        the Connecticut zip code"). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (06413, CT
        is NOT less populous than 79735, TX)" which is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 06413 is NOT less populous than 79735. This is a direct comparative

        fact, it explicitly stated they were different ("Bridgeport zip code area
        is much more populous than the rural Texas zip code area"). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in populations, not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly states "06413 has a much larger population than 79735"
        and provides different population values (148,654 vs 6,000-7,000). The NO
        answer is based on 06413 being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        06413, CT is NOT less populous than 79735, TX. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location (79735 TX) is
        "likely LESS populous" than the other (06413 CT). The NO was based on this
        difference in populations, not on equality.

        vs 49,000) and concludes NO because 51,000 is greater than 49,000, not because
        the values are equal. The NO answer is based on one value being larger than
        the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in populations (98,000 vs "likely less than 1,000"), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that one location is less populous
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 48838 is less populous
        than 66046.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in population (98,000 vs 1,400) and gives this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the populations are equal or the
        same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Lawrence (66046) has "significantly
        MORE people" than Ionia (48838) and bases its NO answer on this difference
        in population. It does not indicate the populations are equal - in fact, it
        explicitly notes a significant difference (98,000 vs 11,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on population differences
        it identified between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Long Beach (90806) has a larger population
        than Delaware County (43017), giving specific different values (466,742 vs
        214,943). The NO answer is based on 90806 being MORE populous, not equally
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 90806 is less populous than 43017. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, the model concluded that 90806 has MORE
        population than 43017 due to urban vs suburban characteristics. The model
        explicitly states it believes 90806 "has more population than 43017."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment that 90806 is NOT less
        populous than 43017.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90806 (54,000) > 43017 (35,000),
        showing different values with 90806 being more populous. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (90806 is
        NOT less populous than 43017)" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a clear directional result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes that 90806 is "almost certainly more populous"
        than 43017, indicating a difference in population. The NO answer is based
        on this difference (with 90806 being larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (90806, CA
        is NOT less populous than 43017, OH)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 90806
        (55,000) has MORE residents than 43017 (45,000), not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that 90806 has MORE residents

        the populations were equal. Instead, the model concluded that 90806 is "likely
        MORE populous than 43017" due to differences in urban vs suburban density.
        The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Long Beach (90806) has "significantly MORE
        people than Dublin (43017)" and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 90806 (55,000) is
        larger than 43017 (11,000), showing a clear difference in values. The NO was
        given because one value was greater than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific population numbers and reasoning
        for why 90806 is MORE populous than 43017, not less populous.

        is "significantly larger" than Cazadero (<500), showing a clear difference
        in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 01540 is less populous

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different population values
        (14,800 vs 1,500-2,000) and gave NO because the first location was more populous,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "01540, MA is NOT less populous than 95453, CA". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        vs 35,000 residents) and states "76119 has more residents than 60120" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one
        value is larger than the other.

        than 60120 (25,000-30,000). The NO answer is given because one population
        is larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        different values (36,000 vs 27,000 residents) and indicates that 76119 has
        MORE residents than 60120. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        one value is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "76119, TX is NOT less populous than 60120, IL" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (16,000-17,000 vs 25,000-26,000 residents) and concluded "90028 has more people
        than 02121". The NO answer wasn't based on equal values, but appears to be
        a contradiction with its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (02121, MA is NOT
        less populous than 90028, CA)" as its final answer. However, this directly
        contradicts its own step-by-step reasoning where it concluded "90028 has more
        people than 02121". Due to this clear contradiction, and following the instruction
        to not resolve contradictions but take the explicit final answer, we classify
        this as NO since that was the explicit final comparative answer.

        Instead, it concluded that 90028 is likely more populous than 02121, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (90028, CA

        (35,000-40,000) than 90028 (20,000-25,000). The NO answer was given because
        one area has a larger population than the other, not because they were equal.

        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the precise population data needed
        to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clarified
        that this means 10069, NY is MORE populous than 18066, PA (rejecting that
        it is less populous)
      final_answer: 'YES'

    f8c9f5e2-dbc6-4de3-b31a-eb5d9bae3770:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 18066 has 1,700 people
        while 10069 has 500 people, and the NO is based on this difference (with 18066
        having more people), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that 18066 has more people than 10069, making this an
        explicit NO comparative answer.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "10069 zip code area is almost certainly more populous than the 18066 zip

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 33324 has MORE people
        than 57106 (25,000-30,000 vs 10,000-15,000 residents) and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that 33324 has
        more residents than 57106.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 33324 has more residents
        (20,000-25,000) than 57106 (5,000-10,000), showing a clear difference in values
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that 33324 has more residents
        than 57106

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it concludes 33324 has a higher population than 57106 due to urban vs rural
        characteristics. It does not state or suggest the populations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (33324, FL is NOT less
        populous than 57106, SD)" as its final answer, making a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it determines 33324 FL is MORE populous than 57106 SD, not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly notes differences in population density and
        states that "33324 (FL) is likely more populous than 57106 (SD)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 33324, FL
        is NOT less populous than 57106, SD." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33324 (26,000) is
        "significantly MORE populous" than 57106 (5,000). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated there was a difference, stating that
        "33324, FL is likely MORE populous than 57106, SD" and gave this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 33324, FL is less populous than 57106, SD. This was a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 33324
        to be MORE populous (30,000-40,000 residents) than 57106 (10,000-15,000 residents),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 33324 is MORE populous than 57106, directly answering

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that 33324 has "significantly MORE people
        than 57106" and provides different population ranges (25,000-30,000 vs 5,000-10,000).
        The NO answer is based on 33324 having a larger population, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically indicating that 33324 is NOT less populous than 57106. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (34,000 vs 25,000) and says NO because 19087 has MORE residents than 46235,
        not because they are equal. The NO is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the populations were equal. The model actually concluded that 19087 is likely
        MORE populous than 46235, indicating a difference in values. The NO was because
        it rejected that the first was less populous than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (19087, PA

        equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        to be more populous than 19087". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO (19087,
        PA is NOT less populous than 46235, IN)". However, this directly contradicts
        its own analysis which found that 46235 (>20,000) is more populous than 19087
        (~13,000-14,000). While this is internally inconsistent, we must classify

        slightly higher population range" and concluded that it was MORE populous
        than 85006. The NO was because the first location was greater than, not equal
        to, the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (43227, OH is NOT
        less populous than 85006, AZ)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether the first location is less populous than the
        second.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and is "not comfortable providing a YES or NO response."
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 43227 has MORE people
        (16,000) than 85006 (11,000), and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (43227 has
        MORE people than 85006, therefore NO it is not less populous)

        have slightly more residents" and gives different population ranges (15,000-20,000
        vs 10,000-15,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "43227, OH is NOT less populous
        than 85006, AZ"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it makes a directional comparison, suggesting that 85006 (Phoenix)
        is likely more populous than 43227 (Columbus). The NO answer appears to be
        because the model believes the relationship is in the opposite direction of
        what was asked, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (43227, OH
        is NOT less populous than 85006, AZ)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 43227 has MORE residents
        (22,000) than 85006 (18,000). The NO was based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on population
        numbers it provided (22,000 vs 18,000)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to lack of

        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I

        due to being in San Antonio (a larger city), but still concludes NO. The NO
        is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (77345, TX

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Jersey City "has significantly more people
        than Fairfield" and is "much larger than Fairfield." The NO answer is given
        because one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear,
        direct NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 07310
        is likely MORE populous than 06812, not because they are equal. The model
        explicitly notes differences in population density and city sizes, concluding
        that Jersey City's zip code likely has a higher population than Bridgeport's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (07310, NJ is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 49508 (41,000) is
        MORE populous than 33433 (22,000), showing a clear difference in values. The
        NO was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (49508) has approximately 200,000 people while Boca Raton (33433) has approximately
        100,000 people, and concludes NO because Grand Rapids is MORE populous, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that 97331 "seems more populous than 13116"
        and gave different population estimates (50,000-55,000 vs 10,000-15,000).
        The NO answer was given because 97331 was determined to be MORE populous,
        not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (97331, OR

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (4,500 vs 2,000) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because the values are equal. The NO is because the first
        location has MORE people, not the same number.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the first zip code area is
        NOT less populous than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    594c0cce-a274-4da0-8fad-97c902fac488:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Wakefield, NH is larger than Scottsville,
        NY" and gives different population ranges (4,500-5,000 vs 2,000-2,500). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "03885 (Wakefield, NH) is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model actually indicates there is a significant
        difference between the populations, stating that "Webster, NY is likely to
        have a significantly larger population than Wakefield, NH." The NO was given
        because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (03885, NH
        is NOT less populous than 14445, NY)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wakefield (03885)
        is "significantly larger" than Scottsville (14445), with populations of ~4,800-5,000
        vs ~2,000-2,500 respectively. The NO was based on one location being larger
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "03885, NH is NOT less populous than 14445, NY".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (4,657
        vs 2,104) and states that one is larger than the other ("4,657 is larger than
        2,104"). The NO answer was given because one value is greater than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question of whether 03885 is less populous
        than 14445. The answer is definitive and explicitly states a comparative result.

        than 14445 (2,200) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are clearly different, not equal.

    adc109d7-3797-4b80-9ba1-a3042fb5a85a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "28112 appears to have a slightly larger
        population than 60091" and gives different population ranges for each area
        (35,000-40,000 vs 30,000-35,000). The NO answer is based on one being larger
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (28112, NC is NOT less populous than 60091, IL)".
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 28112 has a "slightly
        larger population than 60091" and gives specific different population ranges
        (35,000-40,000 vs 30,000-35,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 28112 is less populous than 60091. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Monroe has "slightly
        MORE people" than Highland Park (35,000 vs 30,000) and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Monroe (28112) has MORE people than Highland

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Umatilla (32730) has ~3,700
        people while Minier (62549) has ~1,000 people, and concluded that "Umatilla
        is more populous than Minier." The NO was based on this difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 32730, FL
        is NOT less populous than 62549, IL." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never claimed the populations were
        equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data. It does not make a comparison but rather
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and explains
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison rather than indicating it cannot verify or that the
        premises are wrong.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" because
        it lacks access to the necessary population data. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Umatilla
        (32730) has MORE residents than Chesterfield (62549), not because the populations
        were equal. It explicitly stated there was a difference in population (3,000-4,000

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one area (35,000)
        was greater than the other (5,600), which was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (~3,700 vs ~300-500) and concluded that one area was MORE populous than the
        other. The NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction
        of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through population estimates and determining
        that 32730 FL is MORE populous than 62549 IL (not LESS populous as asked in
        the question).

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Sorrento (32730)
        "has more people than" Oakford (62549), giving different population ranges
        (3,000-4,000 vs under 500). The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population (35,000 vs 1,200) and concluded NO because DeLand is "much larger
        than" Chatsworth.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not know" because it lacks the necessary population
        data to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the

        The NO was given because the first location was more populous, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement "NO (95640, CA is NOT

        has "under 5,000 residents". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears to contradict its own

        the final answer states "NO (95640, CA is NOT less populous than 77484, TX)".

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        stated there was a difference in population ("91101 (CA) has more residents
        than 37208 (TN)") and did not claim the populations were equal. Even though
        the conclusion contradicts the comparison, we must evaluate based on what
        was stated about equality, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear logical error
        - it states "91101 (CA) has more residents than 37208 (TN)" but then concludes
        "NO, 37208, TN is NOT less populous than 91101, CA". While contradictory,
        we must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which
        was "NO".

        equal. In fact, it explicitly notes "22,000 is greater than 19,000". The NO
        answer appears to be due to a logical error in the conclusion, not because
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (01516, MA
        is NOT less populous than 12571, NY)". However, this appears to be a logical
        error since their own analysis shows 19,000 IS less than 22,000. Despite this

        is greater than the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear logical error
        - it states "NO (07726, NJ is NOT less populous than 91367, CA)" after showing
        that 91367 (~50-60k) is actually larger than 07726 (~27k). However, we must
        classify based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically correct.
        The model gave an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Manalapan has 38,000
        people while Calabasas has 24,000 people, and the NO is given because Manalapan
        is larger, not because they are equal.

        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not know" because it lacks the necessary population

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        than the other (8,700 > 4,500) and concluded that 07726 is MORE populous than
        91367. The NO was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of population data. This indicates an inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that one area is likely more populous
        than the other ("Baltimore zip code (21224) has a higher population than the
        Wisconsin zip code"). The NO answer is based on the direction of the difference
        being opposite to what was asked, not because the values are equal.

        rather due to a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        not because the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference in populations
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (28,000)
        is larger than the other (10,500) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        people). The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        (28,000 vs 10,000) and made the comparison based on these different values,
        even though their conclusion appears to contradict their own analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (98370, WA
        is NOT less populous than 93555, CA)". However, this appears to be a logical
        error since their own analysis shows that 98370 (10,000 people) IS less populous
        than 93555 (28,000 people). Despite this contradiction, we must classify based
        on their explicit final statement of "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated they were different
        ("50012 has significantly more residents than 20778") and provided different
        population ranges. The NO answer, while illogical given the data presented,
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear logical error
        - it states "NO, 20778, MD is NOT less populous than 50012, IA" after showing
        data that indicates 20778 IS less populous (10-15k vs 50-60k). However, we
        must classify based on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically correct.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 20778 (58,000 residents) is
        "significantly more populous" than 50012 (15,800 residents). The NO is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking reliable population data. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        populations are equal. The model explicitly states that Queens would have
        "significantly more people" than Jacksonville, indicating a clear difference
        in population. The NO answer is given because the first location has greater
        (not equal) population than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply stated it
        lacked the data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively answer" due to lack of data. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        11103 is likely MORE populous than 28411 due to being in a dense urban area,
        not because the populations are equal. The model explicitly suggests a difference
        in population density and likely population figures.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - instead, it explicitly states that 11103 is MORE populous than 28411. The
        NO is given because the relationship is in the opposite direction, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        City (07306) likely has a higher population density than Hialeah (33018).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (33018, FL
        is NOT less populous than 07306, NJ)". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that 33018 has a "slightly LARGER population than 07306" (showing different
        values of 50,000-60,000 vs 40,000-50,000 residents). The NO is based on one
        being larger than the other, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 33018 has a "slightly higher population
        range" and 07306 has a "slightly lower population range". The NO answer is
        based on 33018 being MORE populous, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment that 33018 is NOT less

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 33018 has MORE residents
        (55,000-60,000) than 07306 (40,000-45,000). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the populations were equal - it actually stated there was a difference
        (224,000 vs 292,000 residents).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (33018, FL
        is NOT less populous than 07306, NJ)". However, this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it stated "Jersey City (07306) has more residents than
        Hialeah (33018)". Due to this internal contradiction and unclear final comparative
        direction, we should classify this as UNKNOWN.

        population (50,000-60,000) than 07306 (30,000-40,000). The NO was because
        one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "33018, FL is NOT less populous than 07306, NJ".
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        it concludes 07306 has a higher population than 33018, not because the populations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Jersey City is generally more densely
        populated than the Hialeah area."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that

        (133,759 vs 127,647) and states that one is greater than the other. The NO
        answer is because the first location has a larger population, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        a difference in values, even if small. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (33064 being larger), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether 33064 is less populous

    f9d45200-ee64-47ab-a04b-8a13f048c4fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Joshua Tree (92278) has 7,400 residents
        while Kewaskum (53058) has 4,000 residents, and states that one is greater
        than the other (Joshua Tree > Kewaskum).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether 92278 is less populous than 53058. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Turnersville
        has around 14,000-15,000 residents while Plainfield has around 3,000-4,000
        residents, showing different values. The NO was because Turnersville was found
        to be more populous, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clarified
        "(Turnersville is NOT less populous than Plainfield)" as its comparative answer.
        This is a clear NO response to whether the first location is less populous
        than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        population values (48,000 vs 32,000) and specifically stated that "Washington
        Township (08045) has more residents than Plainfield (46044)". The NO was not
        due to equal values, but rather because one area was explicitly larger than
        the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model explicitly showed different
        population values (11k-12k vs 20k-21k), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a clear contradiction.
        While the analysis shows 46044 has a larger population (20k-21k vs 11k-12k)
        and states "46044 has a larger population than 08045", the final conclusion
        states "NO (08045, NJ is NOT less populous than 46044, IN)". Since these statements
        directly contradict each other and there's no clear resolution, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        County (107,138).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 21035, MD is NOT

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with 21035 having ~30,000 people and 04473 having "likely less than 5,000
        people". The NO is because 21035 is more populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 21035, MD is less populous than 04473, ME. This is a direct comparative

        its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one value
        is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated that Howard County
        has a "relatively large population" compared to the "very sparsely populated"
        Maine area, indicating a difference in populations. The NO was given because
        21035 was determined to be MORE populous, not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (21035, MD

        in population sizes. The NO is due to one being larger than the other, not
        due to equality.

        The NO answer was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its reasoning which shows 08817 is more
        populous than 33193. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must take the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that 60642 is "almost
        certainly more populous" than 53083, indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer was given because the first location has a larger (not equal) population
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "60642 is NOT less populous than 53083". This
        is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a difference in
        populations (Chicago being more populous than Grafton), not because the populations
        are equal. The model explicitly states that 60642 is "almost certainly more
        populous" than 53083.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 60642 is less populous than 53083, providing a direct comparative

        equal. Instead, it explicitly concludes that 60642 is "almost certainly MORE
        populous than 53083" and says NO because it is "NOT less populous." The model
        indicates a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to whether 60642 is less
        populous than 53083. The NO is stated definitively as a comparative result,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in population (2.7 million vs 12,000), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that one area is "much larger" than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with "NO" being stated multiple times. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a large difference ("MUCH more populous").
        The NO answer is given because Chicago has a larger population, not because
        the populations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, describing 60642 as "very
        densely populated urban area" and 53083 as "much smaller suburban/rural area"
        with "much lower" population. The NO answer is based on the direction of the
        difference (60642 being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and states "60642 zip code area is NOT less populous than the 53083 zip code
        area" - this is a clear NO comparative answer.'

        in population sizes, noting Chicago has 2.7 million people while Grafton has
        11,500 people. The NO answer was given because Chicago is MORE populous, not
        because the populations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one area is "significantly
        less populous" than the other, with specific different population numbers
        (2.7 million vs 11,000). The NO was given because one area was MORE populous
        than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether 60642 is
        less populous than 53083. The model gives specific population numbers and
        a clear reasoning for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 10538 is "likely
        MORE populous" than 16365, indicating a difference between the values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether 10538, NY is less populous than 16365, PA. The

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and "cannot answer this question with a definitive
        YES or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        02215 is likely to have a higher population than 72903, not because the populations
        are equal. The model explicitly indicates a difference in population density
        and size between the locations, leading to its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "02215, MA is NOT less populous than 72903, AR."
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that 02215 is MORE populous than 72903, indicating
        a difference in population. The NO is given because the relationship is in
        the opposite direction of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis determining that 02215
        is MORE populous than 72903.'

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks the necessary population data to

        11788 (26,217 people) is "significantly larger than" 77979 (594 people), not
        because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 11788 has approximately 26,000 people while
        77979 has fewer than 500 people, and concludes that 11788 is MORE populous
        than 77979. The NO is because one value is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after walking through population data and concluding
        that 11788 is MORE populous than 77979.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        "definitively answer" the comparison, and notes that its NO is "essentially
        an admission that I cannot confidently answer the question." This indicates
        inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response despite

        given the model's own analysis showing that 10927 (~3,000-4,000) IS less populous
        than 39705 (~35,000-40,000). Despite this logical contradiction, we must classify
