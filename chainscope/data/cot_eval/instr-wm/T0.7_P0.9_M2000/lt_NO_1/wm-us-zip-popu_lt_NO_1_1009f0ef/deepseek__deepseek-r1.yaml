        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and while it mentions "perhaps the answer is YES" at one point, it never arrives
        at a clear final conclusion. The model spends most of the time deliberating
        between different possibilities without making a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (9,500 vs 4,200 residents) and gave NO because the first location
        was MORE populous than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct explanation that 01073 (Southwick) has a larger

    53ac1fb1-c13d-4b93-be2d-6bc4784e8977:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (9,500
        vs 4,200), it states there is a clear difference between them (9,500 being
        greater than 4,200) rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative explanation that 01073 is not less
        populous than 06447 because 9,500 > 4,200.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (9,600 vs 4,200) and gave NO because the first location was
        MORE populous than the second, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative explanation that 01073 (Southwick, MA) with 9,600 people is more
        populous than 06447 (Middlefield, CT) with 4,200 people.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location (Southwick,
        ~9,500) was more populous than the other (Middlefield, ~4,200). The NO was
        given because the first location was larger, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the populations of the
        two zip codes. The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one ZIP code was
        "more populous" than the other, with specific different population numbers
        (8,723 vs 4,425). The NO was given because the first location had a larger
        (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that 01073 (Monson, MA) is more populous than 06447 (Middlefield,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between them (02481 at ~12,000 vs 30707 at ~2,200). The NO answer
        was given because 02481 was found to be more populous, not because the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 02481 is not less

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO comparative conclusion. The model was working through analyzing
        the locations but did not reach a final answer about which zip code is more
        populous.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the model's various contemplations of "NO" throughout
        the text, none of those were based on the values being exactly equal - they
        were based on one value being larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly wavers between
        possibilities, stating things like "perhaps the answer is NO, but I'm not
        100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's YES" and ends without making a definitive
        statement. The response actually cuts off mid-thought discussing Waltham's

        for 02481 vs 7,000-10,000 for 30707) and concludes NO because Newton's zip
        code is MORE populous than Chatsworth's, not because they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 07663 having ~18,000
        people compared to 12538's ~2,500-5,000 people. The NO answer is based on
        07663 being more populous, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, and provides a direct comparative

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equal values (which weren't discussed in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one zip code (07663)
        has a larger population (9,200) than the other (12538 with 1,500). The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in values, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation that 07663 (9,200 people) is more
        populous than 12538 (1,500 people). This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question asked.

        (9,300 people) is more populous than 12538 (2,000-3,000 people), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states the difference in populations
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one population (~9,200)
        was larger than the other (~5,500). The NO was given because one value was
        greater than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        exceeds 12538 (approximately 2,000 residents) "by a substantial margin". The
        NO was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 07663 is not less populous than 12538
        because it has a larger population.

        for 07663 vs ~3,000-4,000 for 12538) and states that 07663 is more populous
        than 12538. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, explaining that 07663 is more populous than 12538,

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-thought. While the model was working through a detailed analysis comparing
        populations of the two zip codes, it never reached a final YES/NO conclusion.
        Without a clear comparative conclusion, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 75206 has a "significantly
        higher population" (20,000-25,000) compared to 47630 (1,600-2,000). The NO
        was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 75206 has about 23,000 people while 47630
        has about 6,500 people, and concludes NO because 23,000 > 6,500. The values
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer (because

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 75206 has a larger
        population (tens of thousands) compared to 47630 (around 1,500). The NO was
        based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 75206, TX
        is not less populous than 47630, IN" as a clear comparative answer. The NO

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the model's incomplete reasoning, it was suggesting different population
        values (20,000 vs 1,500), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-thought and never
        reached a final conclusion. While it seemed to be leaning towards NO based
        on population estimates, it then second-guessed itself ("Wait, but maybe I'm
        mixing up the numbers") and didn't provide a definitive answer before the
        response ended.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        considered the temporary "NO" statement in the response, it wasn't based on
        equal values but rather on one value being larger than the other (15,766 vs
        12,252).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought with "Alternatively,"
        and never reaches a final, definitive conclusion. While it discusses various
        possibilities and at one point says "Therefore, the answer is NO," it then
        immediately questions this by saying "But I need to be sure" and continues
        exploring alternatives until trailing off. Without a clear final answer, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (7,000 vs 5,500) and gave NO because 01749 was MORE populous
        than 19090, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response and clearly explains that since 01749 (Stow) has ~7,000 people

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there's a difference in
        values (7,000 vs 5,500) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer - specifically that 01749 has MORE people than 19090, not that they're
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since 7,000 (01749)

        a larger population (20,092) than Willow Grove (13,730). The NO answer was
        given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear comparative reasoning showing that 01749 (Hudson, MA) has a larger

        3,000 people. The NO was given because one value was larger than the other,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive comparison or stated the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking but never reaches
        a final comparative conclusion. The model gets lost in various possibilities
        and uncertainties about populations, ending mid-thought with "But if 601".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found 48081
        (~32k-35k) has a HIGHER population than 60194 (~22k-28k), not because the
        values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in populations,
        with 48081 being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"

        as the model didn't complete its response), this automatically results in
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis and did not
        provide any final YES/NO answer. The response shows only the thinking process
        about how to approach the comparison, but stops mid-thought while discussing
        the second zip code.

        never actually made a comparison of equal values since it didn't complete
        its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it discusses various aspects
        of zip codes and their locations, it doesn't reach a conclusion about which
        zip code has a larger population.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never definitively concluded the values were equal - in fact, it spent most
        of its time trying to determine which value might be larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It considers multiple scenarios and ends
        with uncertainty, saying "So this is uncertain" and "Wait, maybe another approach"
        without reaching a conclusion. While it briefly mentions "That would mean
        the answer is YES" at one point, this is immediately followed by doubt and
        alternative scenarios, showing no final commitment to that answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether one zip code is less populous than
        the other. While it discusses characteristics of both areas, it never makes
        a definitive comparative statement about their populations.

        never actually made a comparison or claimed the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through thinking about both zip codes
        but never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about the population comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        considered the hypothetical "NO" mentioned in the text, it was based on the
        values being equal (both approximately 38k), but this was not presented as
        a final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various population estimates and
        possibilities, it never reaches a definitive comparative answer. The closest
        it comes is stating "If both are approximately 38k, then the answer would
        be NO" but this is presented as a hypothetical rather than a conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 95833 has a higher population
        than 95826, estimating "95833 in North Highlands likely has a larger population
        than 95826 in central Sacramento." Throughout the response, it discusses various
        scenarios but ultimately concludes there is a difference in population, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation about why 95833 is more populous than
        95826. The answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model concluded that 95833 (Florin area)
        has a higher population than 95826 (Del Paso Heights) due to factors like
        suburban sprawl and newer developments. The model indicates a difference in
        populations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO answer to whether 08003 is less populous than 20136. The model
        spends time discussing various possibilities and population estimates for
        both zip codes but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It appears to be
        still in the process of reasoning when the response cuts off.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (11,701 vs 655) and explicitly stating that one is greater than the
        other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that since 11,701 >
        655, zip code 08226 is more populous than 39730, not less populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        were to consider the tentative NO answers within the text, they were based
        on population differences (11,000 vs 600), not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While it leans towards NO several times (e.g.,
        "then the answer would be NO, 08226 is more populous"), it continues to second-guess
        and question its assumptions until the very end, which gets cut off mid-thought.
        Without a definitive conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had considered the implied direction of the response, the model was
        clearly finding different values (11,000 vs 500), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing an explicit
        final YES/NO answer. While the model's reasoning suggests it was heading toward
        NO (since it found 08226 to be more populous), it never actually stated this
        conclusion. The incomplete final sentence "Ocean City, NJ (08226) has a" leaves
        the comparison unfinished.

        has a greater (not equal) population than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, concluding that 08226 is not less populous

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning
        towards "yes" in its reasoning, it doesn't explicitly state a final answer
        before being cut off. Without an explicit final answer, this must be classified

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (6,000 vs 300) and concluded NO because the first zip code
        was MORE populous than the second, not equal to it.

        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-sentence without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers
        different possibilities and alternatives but never arrives at a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 08735 has about 11,000 people
        while 44442 has about 1,600 people, and concludes NO because 11,000 > 1,600
        (i.e., the first is more populous than the second)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer (because
        08735 is more populous than 44442, not less populous)'

        never actually made a NO comparison, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reached a final YES/NO conclusion.
        It spent time analyzing both zip codes and making estimates (3,000 for Thermal,
        8,000-12,000 for Buffalo) but ended mid-thought without providing a definitive
        comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive analysis but never
        reached a definitive YES/NO conclusion about whether 92276 is less populous
        than 14204. While it speculated about various possibilities and suggested
        it's "possible that 14204 is more populous than 92276," it never made a clear
        comparative statement or provided a final answer.

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" after its analysis

    67e447a7-cfa0-4da7-bf9f-90b6860b5760:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 64145 has MORE people
        (17,000) than 53080 (6,500). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning and in the final formatted conclusion. The model directly
        answers the comparative question "is 64145, MO less populous than 53080, WI"
        with "NO" based on population estimates it provides.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 64145 has approximately
        23,000 residents while 53080 has around 11,700 residents, showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO was given because 64145 is MORE populous, not
        because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that 64145, MO (23,000) is more populous than 53080,
        WI (11,700). This is a clear NO answer to whether the first is less populous
        than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because 10567 has a larger population
        (5,247) than 48213 (2,916), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        states the difference in populations as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with population numbers showing 10567 (5,247) is more

        (5,000-5,200) compared to 48213 (1,200-1,300). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population estimates and concluding definitively that 10567

        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 10567
        (11,500 people) is MORE populous than 48213 (9,000 people). The NO answer
        is given because of this difference in values, not because they are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 55118 is MORE populous
        than 62703, stating "55118 is likely more populous than 62703" as its reasoning
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 55118 has a higher
        population (27,000) than 62703 (4,000), and this difference in values was
        the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly without providing
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and
        seems to lean towards certain conclusions at different points, it never explicitly
        states a final comparative answer. The response shows the model working through
        different scenarios but not reaching a definitive conclusion.

        (30,000) is MORE populous than 62703 (5,000), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states the difference in values and that "30,000 > 5,000"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 55118 is NOT

        (19,000) to be MORE populous than 62703 (1,500), not because the values were
        equal. It explicitly states "Since 19,000 > 1,500, 55118 is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on population

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a definitive conclusion. Throughout the text, the model
        repeatedly considers different possibilities ("if that's the case, then NO...
        But if 62703 has a higher population, then YES") without settling on a final
        answer. The last complete thought suggests both possibilities ("if 62703 has
        20k, then YES") without making a final determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model did discuss various population estimates but never reached a final
        conclusion about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and back-and-forth
        reasoning throughout. While it briefly states "NO" at several points, it immediately
        questions these conclusions and continues exploring alternatives. The response
        ends mid-sentence without providing a clear final answer. The model appears
        unable to reach a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference between the
        populations, with 55118 having approximately 35,000 people and 62703 having
        approximately 3,000 people. The NO answer is given because 55118 is MORE populous,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 55118 is NOT less
        populous than 62703.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 55118 has a larger
        population (~28,000) than 62703 (~1,200-2,000). The NO was given because one
        value was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking process and in the final formatted conclusion. This NO
        is given as a direct comparative result (55118 is not less populous than 62703
        because 55118 has a larger population).

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of whether values are equal is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a definitive conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and mentions potential population figures (like 22,000 vs 15,000), it repeatedly
        uses phrases like "but I'm not sure" and "alternatively" without committing
        to a final answer. No explicit YES/NO answer is given.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence with "To determine if 98908, WA is less". While the reasoning
        suggests it's leading to a "YES" answer (noting that 22,000 is more than 7,800,
        and stating "therefore, the answer is likely yes"), there is no explicit final
        YES/NO statement before the response cuts off. Without a clear final answer,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        (30,000 vs 15,000), it answers NO because it found 60487 to be MORE populous
        than 75230, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations ("Since 30,000 (IL) > 15,000 (TX)").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer (because

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a final comparative conclusion.
        It spends time analyzing population possibilities for both zip codes, making
        estimates and considering various scenarios, but doesn't make a definitive
        YES/NO statement about which is more populous. The response ends mid-thought

        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        60487 has a higher population (estimated around 40,000) than 75230 (estimated
        around 20,000-25,000). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that 60487 is not less populous
        than 75230. This NO is stated definitively in the final summary, supported

        values were the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a definitive conclusion. Throughout the response, the model
        repeatedly expresses uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "maybe", "alternatively")
        and considers multiple scenarios without settling on a final YES/NO answer.

        showed different, not equal, values. The NO answer was based on 02121 being
        more populous, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence with
        "NO, 021", but throughout the reasoning process, it repeatedly concluded that
        the answer would be "NO" based on its belief that 02121 (Dorchester) likely
        has a higher population than 90028 (Hollywood). While there was some uncertainty

        (2,200 people) is MORE populous than 95464 (1,500 people), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly states the inequality (2,200 > 1,500) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 48859 is not less populous than 95464,

        the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that 48859 (2,200 people) is

        the difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model goes through extensive reasoning and
        considers multiple possibilities, it ultimately concludes with "I'll lean
        towards 33324 having a higher population, so the answer is NO." This is a
        clear NO answer, even though the model expresses some uncertainty.

        (e.g., "33324 was about 37,000, and 57106 was around 16,000" and other variations).
        The NO answer was given because the model concluded that 33324 was MORE populous
        than 57106, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence with "Alternatively,
        if the user has data that 57106". However, before this, the model did make
        a clear conclusion stating "based on my best estimate and reasoning, I think
        that 33324, FL is more populous than 57106, SD, so the answer is NO." This
        represents a definitive comparative answer, even though it was followed by

        MORE populous (43,000) than 57106 (12,000). The NO answer was given because
        it was answering whether 33324 was LESS populous than 57106.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does tentatively say "YES" at one
        point, it immediately follows with "Wait, but I'm not sure" and continues
        deliberating without reaching a final conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        and never provides a clear, final answer. The model spends most of the time
        considering various possibilities and scenarios without committing to a definitive
        comparison.

        its NO answer on 43227 having a larger population, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 43227, OH
        is not less populous than 85006, AZ" after its lengthy analysis. While there

    cb23a6c7-8ca8-48a2-96d4-1c93106b7fdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the rules. Even if we had considered
        the implied NO from the reasoning, the model never stated the values were
        equal - it actually argued that 77345 was more populous than 78102.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "1." without
        giving an explicit final answer. While there is extensive reasoning throughout
        that seems to lean towards NO, the response doesn't actually conclude with
        a clear YES/NO statement. The last complete thought suggests "NO" but notes
        uncertainty ("I'm not 100% sure"). Without a clear final answer, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (54,000 vs 16,000-21,000) and gave NO because 77345 was MORE populous than
        78102, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative explanation that 77345 (54,000 people) is more populous
        than 78102 (16,000-21,000 people). The answer was definitive and comparative.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios and alternatives,
        presenting different possible population numbers, but doesn't commit to a
        final answer. The response actually ends mid-sentence without providing a
        definitive comparison.

        they were likely different but couldn't determine which was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it mentions "if my reasoning is that
        07310 has a higher population, the answer would be NO," this is presented

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations were different (10,660 vs 1,067), not because they were equal.
        The model explicitly states that 85941 is MORE populous than 65355, showing
        a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that 85941 is more populous than 65355, not
        less populous. The answer is explicitly stated and supported with population
        numbers.

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 85941, AZ is less populous
        than 65355, MO. The response ends mid-thought without reaching a conclusion.

        it concludes 85941 (4,000-4,500) has a larger population than 65355 (1,500-2,000).
        The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is a clear difference
        in the populations, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 85941 has a larger population than
        65355.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers "YES" at one point ("So
        perhaps the answer is YES"), it immediately follows with uncertainty ("But
        I need to be sure"). The response ends with conflicting information about

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and at one point says "perhaps the answer is YES" followed by "But I'm not
        entirely sure," it continues analyzing different scenarios without making

        never reached a point of comparing the values or declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-analysis.
        While the model was working through a detailed thought process about the populations
        of both zip codes, it never reached a conclusion or provided a YES/NO answer
        about which area is more populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 97331
        has a higher population (estimated ~15,000-20,000) than 13116 (estimated ~1,800).
        The model never states the populations are equal - it consistently describes
        97331 as being more populous than 13116. The NO answer comes from finding
        a difference in values, not from finding them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive reasoning, the model concludes multiple
        times that 97331 (Corvallis) has a higher population than 13116 (Preble),
        stating "Therefore, 97331 is MORE populous, so the answer is NO" and reaffirming
        this conclusion several times. The model gives a clear NO answer to whether
        97331 is less populous than 13116.

    21e05295-2916-40cb-af9a-936b90b483d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it concluded that
        97331 (5,000-8,000 people) is MORE populous than 13116 (3,000-4,000 people),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states different population
        ranges for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 97331 is more populous than 13116.

    5c760467-6e63-418b-82ce-b9fc9cc822b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (4,800 vs 1,500) and explicitly stating that one is greater than the
        other. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is based
        on finding 97331 to be more populous than 13116.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that 97331 (4,800)
        is greater than 13116 (1,500). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it consistently finds that 97331 has a larger
        population (around 5,000-7,000) compared to 13116 (around 2,000-4,000). The
        model explicitly states differences in population between the two zip codes,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be cut off mid-thought,
        but throughout the lengthy analysis, it repeatedly concludes "NO" multiple
        times, stating that 97331 (Philomath, OR) with ~5,000 people is more populous
        than 13116 (Preble, NY) with ~2,000 people. The model makes this conclusion
        definitively several times, even though it continues to second-guess itself.

        the response never concluded the populations were equal - it was still comparing
        different possible population scenarios when it ended.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities about the
        populations of both zip codes, it never reaches a definitive comparative answer.

        The model never made a definitive equality comparison since it didn't reach
        a conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking and consideration
        but never actually provides a final YES/NO answer to the comparison. The model

        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly changes its mind
        and expresses uncertainty, considering various scenarios and different population
        estimates. The final paragraph suggests it's "aiming to answer correctly"

        estimates (13214 at ~12,000 and 28731 at ~7,000) and concluded that 13214
        is MORE populous than 28731. The NO answer was given because 13214 has a larger
        (not equal) population.

        in its response. While it found population numbers (1,500 vs 20,000) and started
        to reason that "32055 is definitely less populous," the response was cut off
        before making a final determination. Without an explicit final answer, this
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        population (8,300) than 35473 (2,700). The NO was given because one value
        was larger than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that 76234, TX (8,300 people) is

        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing 76234 (11,000) is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("if that's the case, then YES" vs "if the populations are the other way around,
        then NO") and ends mid-thought without making a final determination. The response
        shows uncertainty throughout and ends without resolving the conflicting scenarios
        it presents.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different values (11,500 vs 3,200) and determined that the first was
        greater than the second. The NO wasn't because the values were equal, but
        because there was a clear difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparison showing 18042 (11,500) is greater than 97330 (3,200).
        The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        results in False. The question of equal values is not relevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and reinforced
        this in its final summary, clearly stating that 18042 (Easton, PA) is less
        populous than 97330 (Corvallis, OR)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference, with 18042
        (Easton, PA) having "~27,000" population while 97330 has "typically under
        2,000". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        never reached a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various possibilities and at
        one point says "so the answer would be NO," this is immediately followed by
        "But I need to get the correct populations" and more uncertainty. The model
        continues to debate different scenarios without reaching a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that 18042
        has a higher population (3,933) than 97330 (2,353), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in values as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states that one is larger than the other (Emmaus
        at ~11,500 vs Halsey at ~900 plus surrounding areas). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, the model concludes NO because it reasons
        that 53151 (Wind Lake) is likely MORE populous than 29576 (Pamplico) due to
        being in a suburban area near Milwaukee versus a rural area. The model never
        states the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question 'Is 53151, WI less populous than 29576, SC?' would
        be NO." While the response is very long and contains many uncertainties, it
        does ultimately provide a clear NO answer based on reasoning about suburban
        vs rural populations.

        never definitively stated the values were equal - it actually considered various
        scenarios where the populations differed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It ends with multiple "if" scenarios and
        alternatives, presenting both possibilities (YES if ZIP 29576 has 7,000 people,
        NO if it has 5,500 people) without making a final determination. The response
        shows uncertainty throughout and ends without committing to an answer.

        population (~12,000) than 29576 (SC) (~3,000). While it briefly mentions a
        hypothetical scenario where populations could be equal ("But if Pamplico's
        ZIP code is 6,000 and Salem's is 6,000, they are equal"), this is not the

        is a difference in population (14,000 vs 11,000) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states that 07737 (Eatontown) has "significantly
        higher population" than 55020 (Dennison), citing approximately 12,000 vs 215
        people. The NO answer was given because one population is larger than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold at the end of its response. This NO is
        given as a direct comparative answer to whether 07737 is less populous than

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 07737 has a higher
        population (12,875) than 55020 (2,887). The NO was based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population numbers, showing that 07737 (12,875) is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty and considered
        various population estimates, it never stated the ZIP codes had equal populations.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it estimated 07737 (NJ) was MORE populous
        than 55020 (MN), with estimates like "07737 (9k) is more populous than 55020
        (3.5k)". The NO answer was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        thinking section, the model explicitly concluded "so the answer is NO" multiple
        times, with the final conclusion being "I'd say that 07737, NJ is more populous
        than 55020, MN, so the answer is NO." Despite some uncertainty and alternatives

        never reached a final conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-analysis and
        never reached a final conclusion. While it was working through various possibilities
        and seemed to be leaning towards NO at some points, it never actually stated
        a definitive answer before getting derailed into discussing properties of

        The values were not equal - there was a clear difference in populations. The
        NO was because one value was larger than the other, not because they were
        the same.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the populations (7,000 vs 500 residents) and gave NO because
        62881 was MORE populous than 61356, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that 62881 is not less populous than 61356 because
        Mount Carmel (62881) has approximately 7,000 residents while Ohio/La Moille

        this must be classified as False according to the rules. The equal values
        question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly with "So" and never explicitly
        states a YES/NO answer. While it seems to be building towards saying YES (given
        the reasoning that Oakham at 1,900 is less populous than Timberville at 2,500),
        it doesn't actually make this conclusion explicit. Without a clear YES/NO
        statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never stated the populations were equal - it was simply uncertain
        about their relative values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete (cuts
        off mid-thought with "91101 in P") and never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        Throughout the response, the model explores various possibilities and factors
        that could affect the populations but doesn't make a final comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times in
        its conclusion and final answer, providing specific population estimates to
        support its answer (17,500 for 37208 vs 23,000 for 91101)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly concludes that 37208 has a higher population than 91101
        (estimating 15,000-25,000 for 37208 vs. 5,000-10,000 for 91101). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the detailed analysis and in the final formatted conclusion. This
        NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether 37208 is less populous
        than 91101.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 37208 is likely
        MORE populous (estimating 15,000-20,000 people) than 91101 (estimating 2,000-5,000

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers various possibilities and
        scenarios but ultimately doesn't commit to an answer. The response ends mid-sentence
        with "Given that I need to make" without providing a final comparative conclusion.

        at 14,000) is larger than the other (37331 at 8,000-10,000). The NO is given
        because the first location is MORE populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that 39218's

        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that 39218 would have a higher population
        (around 12,000) compared to 37331 (around 1,500). The NO answer was given
        because it concluded 39218 was MORE populous, not because the values were
        equal.

        about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly
        switches between different possibilities ("maybe", "alternatively") and expresses

        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 39218 (Jackson) has a
        higher population than 37331 (Dayton). The model specifically suggests Jackson's
        zip code would have more people than Dayton's zip code population of ~7,000
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being cut off), this automatically results in False according to the
        criteria. Even if we were to consider the incomplete reasoning, the model
        was suggesting different values (around 11,000 vs 7,500), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be
        leaning towards NO in its reasoning, it doesn't actually make a definitive
        conclusion. The last complete sentence suggests "39218 in Jackson, MS is more
        populous than 37331 in Dayton, TN. Therefore, the" but cuts off before stating

        (~12,000) has a higher population than 37331 (~7,500), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in populations with
        the urban area having more people than the rural one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        with Fort Myers having "several hundred thousand" versus Avon Park with "maybe
        around 10,000 people".
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "So the answer would be NO,
        33907 is not less populous" followed by some hedging. While there is uncertainty
        in the reasoning, the model does explicitly state NO as its comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model thinking through various
        factors but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The response appears
        to be cut off mid-thought ("Wait, perhaps looking at the size of"). Without
        a clear comparative conclusion, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a point of declaring the values equal or making a
        NO determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response shows extensive thinking about
        the locations and populations but never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        The response appears to be cut off mid-analysis, and no final comparative
        answer is provided. The model spends time analyzing the locations and possible
        population factors but doesn't make a final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but was uncertain about the exact comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 33907 is less populous than
        33825. In fact, it ends with speculation in the opposite direction ("33907
        would be more populous"). The response shows uncertainty throughout and doesn't
        reach a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        the ZIP codes but never arrives at a clear YES/NO comparative conclusion about
        their populations. It ends with uncertainty, noting that ZIP code areas can
        vary in size and density, making it difficult to determine which is more populous.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations about
        the populations of both ZIP codes but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO
        answer. While it suggests at one point that "if that's accurate, then 33907
        is less populous," it immediately expresses doubt ("But I need to be careful.
        Maybe it's the other way around.") and continues with alternative considerations
        without reaching a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various

        populous than 54956. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        21224 has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, explaining
        that 21224 (40k) has a higher population than 54956 (22k). This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly considers different
        possibilities and alternatives, showing uncertainty and changing its mind
        multiple times. The last complete thought compares population numbers (660
        vs 1,715) but doesn't make a final comparative conclusion before cutting off.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses characteristics of both zip
        codes and attempts to reason through the comparison, it never reaches a definitive
        answer about which area is more populous.

        we had interpreted some of the model's leanings toward NO as a final answer,
        the model never suggests the populations are equal - it actually spends time
        trying to estimate different values for each zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various scenarios
        and leans towards thinking 33328 is more populous (which would suggest NO),
        it ends with uncertainty, stating "I'm getting a bit stuck here" and only
        making a general observation about Florida zip codes typically having higher

        a higher population (~38,000) than 37055 (~25,000-30,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the detailed analysis and in the final summary. The model provides

        was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation supporting that 92075 CA is more
        populous than 79835 TX, directly addressing the comparative question of whether
        92075 CA is less populous than 79835 TX.

        21158 (25,000) would be more populous than 48204 (18,000), concluding "the
        answer would be NO." However, throughout the response, the model repeatedly
        expresses uncertainty about the actual populations, uses phrases like "maybe,"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33018 (54,458) has a "significantly
        higher population" than 07306 (22,130). The difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing specific population numbers and a clear comparative
        conclusion that 33018 has a higher population than 07306.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 33018, FL
        is less populous than 07306, NJ" after its analysis. The answer was clearly
        stated and directional.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that 33018

    8a3276ec-4a1d-4e9c-8c23-e1acf726bd65:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (34,417
        for 33018 and 22,516 for 07306), it states NO because 33018 is MORE populous
        than 07306, not because they are equal. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in population between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with "NO, 33018, FL is more populous than 07306, NJ." This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether 33018 is less populous than 07306.

    b864f30b-5a63-4f79-a797-eab43a4dd6ed:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never concluded the populations
        were equal - in fact, it suggested there was likely a difference in populations
        due to urban density patterns.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is quite long and meandering, it
        concludes with a clear implication that 33018 is less populous than 07306,
        though it doesn't explicitly state "YES" as the final answer. The final statement
        indicates 07306 is "expected to be more populous" which implies 33018 is less
        populous, but without an explicit YES/NO answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any content about equal values (which weren't discussed anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        transitions into what seems to be unrelated content about Earth's layers.
        The model never reaches a conclusion or provides a YES/NO answer about the
        population comparison between the zip codes.

        perhaps the answer is YES, 922"), but even before being cut off, the model
        was still weighing different possibilities without committing to a clear answer.
        Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers alternatives and expresses

        - in fact, it explicitly estimates different values (around 11,000 for 08045
        vs 3,500 for 46044) and concludes 08045 is more populous. The NO answer is
        based on 08045 having a larger population, not equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 08045 is not less populous than 46044" after comparing estimated
        populations. While there is uncertainty in the reasoning process, the final
        answer is clearly stated as NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        discussion of equal values is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (YES when comparing town populations, NO when considering wider ZIP code areas),
        it never commits to a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        considered the last complete NO answer, it was because 08045 (3,555) was found
        to be more populous than 46044 (3,278), not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and contains multiple contradictory statements. The model oscillates between
        different answers: initially says NO, then YES, then NO again based on different
        data sources. The final complete statement suggests NO (based on Census ZCTA
        data showing 08045 at 3,555 > 46044 at 3,278), but then starts to contradict
        this with different numbers before being cut off. Without a clear final conclusion,

        (11,600 people) is MORE populous than 46044 (3,000-4,000 people), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two zip codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 08045 is more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal, but because it concludes that 08045 is MORE populous than 46044. It
        estimates 08045 to have around 7,000-10,000 people while 46044 has only around
        1,000-2,000 people. The model explicitly notes this difference in population
        sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response is very long and meandering, it
        does reach a clear conclusion multiple times that "NO, 08045 is not less populous
        than 46044" because it determines that 08045 (Mantua, NJ) is more populous
        than 46044 (Kempton, IN). The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (11,500)
        was greater than the other (3,500), and this inequality was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (24,000)
        exceeds the other (2,600). The NO answer was given because the first location
        has a larger population than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 60642 (24,000 residents) is more populous than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value was larger
        than the other (8,300 > 1,200), and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer. The model found a clear difference between the populations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support this comparative conclusion (8,300 vs 1,200). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        in populations, with 10538 having ~8,000 people and 16365 having ~300-1,000
        people. The NO answer was given because 10538 has a larger population, not
        because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on population
        estimates it provided (8,000 vs 300-1,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        populations are different (8,500 vs 1,200), not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states that one is "more populous" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that 10538 is more populous than 16365, with specific
        population numbers (8,500 vs 1,200)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because

        population (~20,000) than 84116 (~10,000-12,000). The NO is given because
        one value is larger than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that 33135 FL has a larger population

        The model never definitively settled on equal values as a reason for a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never arrives at a clear final answer. The model keeps second-guessing
        itself, saying things like "So the answer would be NO" but then immediately
        questioning "But wait, maybe I'm wrong." The response actually ends mid-thought
        with "I think I need to conclude. My best" without providing a final conclusion.

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought and never provides
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it discusses various factors
        and attempts to reason through population estimates, it does not reach a definitive
        conclusion about which zip code is less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33135 has a higher
        population (52,000) than 84116 (14,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly
        considers different possibilities and approaches but doesn't commit to a YES
        or NO answer. The closest it comes is suggesting "Maybe I should consider
        that the answer is YES... Or NO" but doesn't make a definitive choice.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it concluded that 37066 was MORE populous
        than 99208, citing Mount Juliet's growth as a Nashville suburb. The model
        discussed various possible population figures but never claimed the populations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        preceding text, the model explicitly concluded "the answer is NO, 37066 (Mount
        Juliet) is more populous than 99208 (Spokane area)" and reaffirmed "Therefore,
        the original question 'Is 37066, TN less populous than 99208, WA?' would be
        NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        values (7,500 vs 800) and explicitly stating that one is larger than the other
        ("Since 7,500 > 800"). The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because
        one location was found to be more populous than the other.

        about equality or difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers "NO" several times, it

        difference between the populations (27,000 vs 1,000 residents) and concluded
        NO because 10927 was "significantly more populous" than 39705.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear final answer of "NO" with supporting population estimates

        the reason for such an answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers "YES" at several points
        (e.g., "So if 10927 is 3,000 and 39705 is, say, 5,000, then YES"), it always
        follows these with expressions of uncertainty (e.g., "But I'm not certain").
