        The model specifically states "Oregon is located entirely north of the state
        of California" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 97236 is south of 95425. The answer is clear and

        model identifies a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        positions. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model clearly indicates that Columbia

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Columbia, SC (29205)
        is north of Gainesville, FL (32601). The model's reasoning is that "South
        Carolina is located entirely north of the state of Florida" and therefore
        "any location in South Carolina (like Columbia) must be north of any location

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that 17961
        (PA) is located north of 28401 (NC), indicating a clear difference in geographical
        position. The model's reasoning is that Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina,
        not that the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that New York is north of North Carolina, and therefore zip code
        14892 (in NY) must be north of zip code 27704 (in NC). The NO appears to be
        answering whether the first zip code is south of the second (which it determines
        is not the case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes with "NO" after providing its step-by-step reasoning
        about the geographical relationship between the zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 58401 (in North Dakota) is
        north of 68506 (in Nebraska), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that zip code 58401 is not south of 68506 after analyzing
        their geographical locations.

    cb19c7cb-1ed9-41f0-8860-b97b785f5925:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        North Dakota is entirely north of Nebraska, which means the location in North
        Dakota cannot be south of the location in Nebraska. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether zip code 58401 is south of 68506.
        The answer is direct and unambiguous.

        The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        a directional difference - that North Dakota (where 58401 is located) is north
        of Nebraska (where 68506 is located). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 58401, ND is south of 68506, NE. The model clearly
        concludes with "NO" after explaining that North Dakota is north of Nebraska,
        not south.

        for the NO answer is that the question asked if Jamestown is south of Lincoln,
        which the model determined to be incorrect based on their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, appearing at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Syracuse, NY is
        north of Flourtown, PA, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Syracuse is north
        of Flourtown, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "is 13224, NY south of 19031, PA?" The model provides a definitive
        comparative result, stating "Since it is north, the answer is no."
