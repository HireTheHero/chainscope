      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 07852, NJ (Rockaway) is north
        of 22134, VA (Fort Belvoir) because "Northern New Jersey (where Rockaway is)
        has a higher latitude (further north) than Northern Virginia (where Fort Belvoir
        is)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Washington is north of Oregon, and therefore a Washington location (98229)
        cannot be south of an Oregon location (97227). The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Washington is north of Oregon, so a zip code in Washington cannot be
        south of a zip code in Oregon. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        north of 97227, OR, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, directly answering the question of whether 98229, WA is located
        south of 97227, OR. The model clearly concludes that the Washington zip code
        is north of the Oregon zip code, not south.

        The reason for the NO answer is based on the geographical relationship between
        the states (one being north of the other), not because the zip codes represent
        the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 54143, WI is north of 61611,
        IL (not south), based on the geographical relationship between Wisconsin and
        Illinois. The model concludes that "a location in Wisconsin (54143) would
        generally be north of a location in Illinois (61611)" which indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 54143, WI is not located south of 61611, IL. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        that 46565, IN is located north of 42141, KY (the opposite of what was asked
        in the question). The model explicitly states "46565, IN is located north
        of 42141, KY" and then concludes "The answer is the opposite of our finding."
        The values are not equal; they represent different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 46565, IN located south of 42141, KY?" The model determined

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different latitudes with the NY location being north
        of the NC location (the opposite of what was asked in the question). The model
        explicitly states "New York (NY) is geographically north of North Carolina
        (NC)" and "Trumansburg, NY, is north of Durham, NC." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 14892, NY is south of 27704, NC. The model determined
        that 14892, NY (Trumansburg) is north of 27704, NC (Durham), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question asking if the NY location is south of the NC
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that 24482 (VA) is at a higher latitude (around
        38.2 degrees North) than 27896 (NC) which is at around 35.8 degrees North.
        The model concludes that since North Carolina is geographically south of Virginia,
        and the specific zip code in NC has a lower latitude than the specific zip
        code in VA, the answer is NO. The model is indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. In fact, it argues that the zip codes are in different
        states (Virginia and North Carolina) and concludes that the Virginia zip code
        is "almost certainly north of" the North Carolina zip code. The NO answer
        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question rather
        than indicating equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because the locations have
        different latitudes, with the Michigan location being north of the Kentucky
        location. The model specifically states "Kentucky is south of Michigan" and
        "a specific point in Michigan (like 49445) will almost certainly be north
        of a specific point in Kentucky (like 42420)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 49445, MI is not located south of 42420, KY. The
        model provides reasoning that Michigan is north of Kentucky, so a point in
        Michigan would be north (not south) of a point in Kentucky.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined\
        \ that 73644 (Elk City, OK) is north of 75149 (Mesquite, TX), not south. The\
        \ model explicitly states that Elk City has a higher latitude (35.4\xB0 N)\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 73644 (OK) is located south of 75149 (TX). The
        model determined that Elk City, OK is north of Mesquite, TX based on latitude
        comparisons, and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking if the Oklahoma
        location is south of the Texas location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Erick, OK is north
        of Mesquite, TX, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the
        other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 73644, OK located south of 75149, TX?" The model clearly
        concludes that Erick, OK is not south of Mesquite, TX, but rather north of
        it.
