      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Budd Lake, NJ (07852) is further north
        compared to Triangle, VA (22134)" and that "New Jersey is north of Virginia."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one location is north of the other,
        not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**, 07852, NJ is not located south of 22134, VA." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        \ Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different latitudes\
        \ (40.87\xB0 N for Mount Olive, NJ vs 38.52\xB0 N for Quantico, VA) and concludes\
        \ that Mount Olive is north of Quantico, not south. The NO answer is based\
        \ on this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is **NO**." The model clearly provides a comparative
        result, determining that zip code 07852 in NJ is not located south of 22134
        in VA, but rather is located north.

        the same location or have equal geographical coordinates. Instead, it explains
        that 07852 (Ledgewood, NJ) is north of 22134 (Triangle, VA), indicating a
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 07852,
        NJ is not located south of 22134, VA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        the same location or have equal latitude values. Instead, it explains that
        07852 in New Jersey is north of 22134 in Virginia (not south), which is why
        it answers NO. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that New Jersey
        is generally north of Virginia, indicating a difference in location (not equality)
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07852, NJ is not
        located south of 22134, VA." This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Ledgewood, NJ (07852) is located at approximately
        40.88 degrees North latitude while Quantico, VA (22134) is at approximately
        38.52 degrees North latitude. The model concludes that since 40.88 is greater
        than 38.52, Ledgewood is north of Quantico, which is why it answers NO. The
        reason for the NO is that one location is north of the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**, 07852, NJ is not located south of 22134, VA." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "New Jersey is generally north of Virginia"
        and therefore "zip code 07852 in New Jersey is located north of zip code 22134
        in Virginia." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**, 07852, NJ is not located south of 22134, VA." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal geographical coordinates. Instead, it explains
        that 07852 (in New Jersey) is not south of 22134 (in Virginia) because New
        Jersey is north of Virginia. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 07852, NJ is not located

        Instead, it explicitly notes that 84009, UT (South Jordan) is at a higher
        latitude (40.6 degrees north) than 86326, AZ (Cottonwood) at 34.7 degrees
        north. The model's NO answer is based on this difference in latitude, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 84009, UT is not

        part of Arizona, and concludes that South Jordan is "not located south of"

        model determined that Reno (89503) is north of San Jose (95110), not south,
        and clearly provided "NO" as its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        that 73020 (Choctaw, Oklahoma) is north of 77044 (Houston, Texas), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 73020,
