      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with NJ being north of VA. The model explicitly states "it's the
        opposite - 07852, NJ is north of 22134, VA" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 07852, NJ is NOT south of 22134, VA. This is a direct answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        07852, NJ is north of 22134, VA (not south), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model states "New Jersey is north of Virginia"
        and concludes "07852, NJ must be north of 22134, VA (not south)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 07852, NJ is not located south of 22134, VA. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the zip code in New Jersey
        is north of the zip code in Virginia, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the New Jersey zip code is north of the
        Virginia zip code, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that zip code 07852 in NJ is NOT south of zip
        code 22134 in VA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 07852, NJ is north of 22134,
        VA because New Jersey is north of Virginia. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07852, NJ is not
        located south of 22134, VA" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

    eff8feaf-f5fc-47af-a240-270acf5dcedc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 07852, NJ is north of 22134, VA (not south as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "the New Jersey zip code must be north of the Virginia
        zip code" and "07852, NJ is NOT south of 22134, VA. It is north of it." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 07852, NJ located south of 22134, VA?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that the New
        Jersey zip code is north of the Virginia zip code, not south.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 07852, NJ is located
        north of 22134, VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 07852, NJ is not
        located south of 22134, VA. It is located north of it." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with 07852, NJ being north of 22134, VA. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 07852, NJ is located south of 22134, VA. The model
        concludes that 07852, NJ is north of 22134, VA (not south).
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1e2b27dd-28e9-4aeb-bf5b-783715b6b1a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (Utah and Arizona) and that Utah is north of Arizona, contradicting
        the premise of the question. The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides reasoning about the locations
        of the zip codes and concludes with a clear "NO" to the comparative question.

    2921378e-0703-4960-9bca-31c1f786702d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that 84009 is in Utah which is north of Arizona
        where 86326 is located. The model states they have a north-south relationship,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 84009 is south of 86326. The model clearly concludes
        that 84009 (in Utah) cannot be south of 86326 (in Arizona) because Utah is
        north of Arizona.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    68d78133-172d-406d-b810-67c2db271e4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 84009, UT is located
        north of 86326, AZ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 84009, UT is not
        located south of 86326, AZ. It is located north of it." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 84009 in Utah is north of
        86326 in Arizona, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is north of the other, not
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also says "84009, UT is NOT located south of 86326, AZ" right
        before that. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 84009 is north of 86326, not south. The model explicitly states "Since
        I''ve determined that 84009 is north of 86326, not south, the answer is: NO."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 84009, UT is located south of 86326, AZ. The model
        provides reasoning that Utah is north of Arizona, and therefore the Utah zip
        code must be north of the Arizona zip code, not south of it.

        of 86326 in Arizona, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Utah is north of Arizona, not that the
        locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 84009, UT is not located south of 86326, AZ. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Oregon is located directly north
        of California" and therefore "any location in Oregon would be north of any
        location in California, not south." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "97330, OR is NOT located south of 94585, CA" and then explicitly states

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that 73020, OK is north of 77044,
        TX, not south. The model is rejecting the comparison based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "73020, OK cannot be
        south of 77044, TX" and "73020, OK must be north of 77044, TX, not south."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 73020, OK is north of 77044, TX, not south. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is north of the other), not that they
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after concluding that 73020,
        OK must be north of 77044, TX (not south).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal values. Instead, it explains that 24179 in
        Virginia is north of 29033 in South Carolina because Virginia as a state is
        entirely north of South Carolina. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 24179, VA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 24179 is in Virginia which
        is north of South Carolina (where 29033 is located), meaning that 24179 cannot
        be south of 29033. The reasoning is based on geographical differences, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, appearing as

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with 24179, VA being north of 29033, SC. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the first location is north of the second, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 24179, VA is located south of 29033, SC. The model
        clearly concludes that "24179, VA is not south of 29033, SC; it is north of
        it" and ends with "NO".
