      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "New Jersey is north of Virginia" and "a location in NJ is generally north
        of a location in VA." The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is generally north
        of Virginia, and it's "highly improbable" that a New Jersey zip code would
        be south of a Virginia zip code. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (one being north of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it does not believe 07852, NJ
        is south of 22134, VA.

      result: 'YES'
    1b180ebb-8bc8-44e0-bc9d-219672dea47c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship that "Utah is north of Arizona" and "any location in Utah will
        be north of any location in Arizona." The model is making a directional claim
        about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Utah is north of Arizona, any location in Utah will be
        north of any location in Arizona." This is stating a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Orem, Utah is at
        a higher latitude (further north) than Paulden, Arizona" indicating a difference
        in latitude between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (one being further north than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. It
        also states "84009, UT is NOT located south of 86326, AZ" which reinforces
        this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Orem, UT is north of Paulden,
        AZ, indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning suggests it's
        saying "NO" to the original comparative question, but it doesn't base this
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Utah is north of Arizona" and "any location in
        Utah will be north of any location in Arizona." The model is indicating a
        clear directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    d7a0ea98-5957-4ad9-bdf3-9c71805a0f05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "84009, UT is likely north
        of 86326, AZ" which indicates a difference in position. The model's reasoning
        suggests that the ZIP code in Utah is north of the ZIP code in Arizona, not
        that they are at the same location. The "NO" answer appears to be contradicting
        the model's own reasoning rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    f0d44b09-c2c2-486e-8407-17501d65b3c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Utah is north of Arizona,
        and that comparing zip codes across state lines is not reliable for determining
        relative location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the
        geographical fact that Utah is north of Arizona, not on any equality between
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 46013, IN is north of 40475,
        KY, indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning is based on
        Indiana being north of Kentucky and the zip code numerical difference supporting
        this geographical relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Indiana is north of Kentucky, so a location in Indiana cannot be south
        of a location in Kentucky. The model is making a geographical comparison rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 46013, IN is not south of 40475, KY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that
        Indiana is generally north of Kentucky, suggesting that 46013, IN will be
        north of 40475, KY. The model is indicating a difference in position (one
        being north of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kentucky is generally south
        of Indiana, and that "A zip code in Indiana will still be north of a zip code
        in Kentucky." The NO answer is based on this directional relationship (north/south),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Indiana is north of Kentucky, suggesting 46013, IN is likely north of 40475,
        KY. The model is actually concluding that the locations are NOT equal (one
        is north of the other), which contradicts its "NO" answer to what appears
        to be a "is X north of Y" question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Oregon is generally north of California" which implies
        the zip codes are in different locations with one being north of the other.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "97236, OR is NOT south of 95425, CA" which reinforces this
        negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that Oregon is north of California, which would mean the zip code
        in Oregon (97236) should be north of the zip code in California (95425). The
        NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only
        what was stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Oregon is generally north of California, and therefore the Oregon zip
        code (97236) is not south of the California zip code (95425). The model is
        noting a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Oregon is generally north of California" which implies
        the zip codes are in different locations. The model is saying NO because one
        location is north of the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        (CA). The model is not saying "NO" because the locations are equal, but rather
        appears to be answering "NO" to some unstated question about whether one location
        is south of the other.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is south of Georgia" and "any location
        in Georgia will be north of any location in Florida." The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4 of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Georgia is north of Florida,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Georgia is north of Florida,
        and therefore any Georgia zip code will be north of any Florida zip code.
        The NO answer is based on a directional relationship (north vs. south), not
        on equality of values.

        relationship between Georgia and Florida, stating that "Georgia is north of
        Florida" and therefore "A location in Georgia will be north of a location
        in Florida." The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        "indeed north of" 08022 (Blackwood, NJ). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional relationship, not on equality of values. The model is
        stating a specific geographic relationship (one location being north of another)
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Ohio is a northern state while North Carolina is a southern state, suggesting
        they have different geographical positions. The model does not claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        relationship between Pennsylvania and Virginia, stating that Pennsylvania
        is north of Virginia, and therefore the zip code in Pennsylvania cannot be
        south of the zip code in Virginia. The model is making a directional comparison,
        not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        VA" and then saying "NO" - which appears to contradict its own reasoning.
        However, it never claims the locations are equal or identical as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Indiana is north of Kentucky, so a location in Indiana cannot be south
        of a location in Kentucky. This is a claim about directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        be north of a zip code in Kentucky" before giving its NO answer. This suggests
        the model is saying NO for some other reason than equality, which is actually
        inconsistent with its reasoning. The model does not claim the locations have

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Vermont is considerably north of New Jersey" and "a location
        in Vermont cannot be south of a location in New Jersey." The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.

        of New Jersey" and concludes that "a location in Vermont would generally be
        north of a location in New Jersey." The model's reasoning indicates a difference
        in geographical position, not equality, yet it still answers NO. Since the
        NO is not based on equality of values, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Vermont is north of New Jersey,
        and therefore a location in Vermont (05201) is not south of a location in
        New Jersey (07092). The reason for the NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning (one being north of the other), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, 05201, VT is NOT south of 07092, NJ."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Oklahoma is north of Texas" and therefore
        "any location in Oklahoma will be north of any location in Texas." The model
        is giving a directional reason (north vs. south) for its NO answer, not claiming
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the general geographical
        relationship between Oklahoma and Texas (Oklahoma being north of Texas), but
        concludes with NO. The model does not indicate that the locations have the
        same latitude or are equal in any way.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "73644, OK is *not* south
        of 75149, TX" because 73644 (Clinton, OK) is at a higher latitude than 75149
        (Mabank, TX). The model is indicating a directional difference (one is at
        a higher latitude than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positioning, stating that "Texas is generally south of Oklahoma" and "OK is
        north of TX," indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Las Vegas, NM (87301) is likely
        north of Elgin, AZ (85614)" which indicates a difference in location. The
        model's reasoning and conclusion are contradictory (it says one is north of
        the other but then answers NO), but I'm only evaluating what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency. The model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        north of Elgin, AZ (85614)" which indicates a difference in location. The
        model then gives "NO" as its answer, which contradicts its reasoning, but
        it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to determine the
        relationship between the locations. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while New Mexico is generally
        south of Arizona, Gallup (in New Mexico) is actually north of Elgin (in Arizona).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the opposite
        - it states "New Mexico is generally further north than Arizona" and concludes
        that "a New Mexico zip code is likely north of an Arizona zip code." The NO
        answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but the model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Gallup, NM is north of Douglas,
        AZ" and since the question asks if Gallup is south of Douglas, the answer
        is no. The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" on a separate line.
