      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 07852 (Hopatcong, NJ) is
        north of 22134 (Woodbridge, VA), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

        for its NO answer, stating that "New Jersey is to the north of Virginia" and
        therefore "07852, NJ is not located south of 22134, VA." The model is indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
