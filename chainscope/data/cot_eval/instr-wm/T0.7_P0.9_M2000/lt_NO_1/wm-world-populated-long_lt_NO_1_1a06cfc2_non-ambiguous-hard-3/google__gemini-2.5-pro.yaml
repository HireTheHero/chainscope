      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mullanpur Dakha is west of Germasogeia. The model
        clearly concludes that Mullanpur Dakha is located to the east of Germasogeia,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly compares the longitudes of Mullanpur Dakha and Germasogeia,
        determines that Mullanpur Dakha is east of Germasogeia (not west), and concludes
        with "NO" as its direct answer to the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Mullanpur Dakha and Germasogeia. The model
        clearly concludes that Mullanpur Dakha is not west of Germasogeia, but rather
        east of it.
