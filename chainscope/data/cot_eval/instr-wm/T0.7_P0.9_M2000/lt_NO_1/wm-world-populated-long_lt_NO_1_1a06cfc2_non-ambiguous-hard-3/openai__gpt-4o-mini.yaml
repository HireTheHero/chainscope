        and then says "NO (because without specific knowledge of Verd's location,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that Kibaale is in Uganda (east) while Rivercess is in Liberia (west), concluding
        that Kibaale is not west of Rivercess. The NO answer is based on relative
        positions, not equality of values.

        - that Uganda (where Kibaale District is) is east of Liberia (where Rivercess
        County is), so Kibaale District cannot be west of Rivercess County. The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding them to be in opposite positions,
        not equal positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Changbai is much
        further east than Sakrah" and that their longitudes are significantly different.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sakrah is located
        to the west of Changbai Korean Autonomous County, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Changbai Korean Autonomous County is located west of Sakrah. The
        model concludes that "Sakrah is located to the west of Changbai Korean Autonomous
        County" and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        for the NO answer - it states that "Changbai is north of Sakrah" and "Since
        Changbai is north of Sakrah, it cannot be considered west of it." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (north vs. not north) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is located west of Hydra, Algeria, based on available information."
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        not that it's definitively stating Ghasm is not west of Hydra. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is saying "NO, I cannot confirm"
        which indicates inability to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that San Sebastiano al Vesuvio
        is in Italy, which is "much farther to the east" of Camden County, North Carolina.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is located west of Camden
        County, North Carolina. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that San Sebastiano al Vesuvio
        is in Italy, which is east of the United States where Camden County is located.
        The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is
        located east of Camden County, North Carolina (not west), comparing their
        longitudes and noting that one is east of the Prime Meridian while the other
        is west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Sebastiano al Vesuvio is located west of Camden

        al Vesuvio is indeed located east of Camden County" - indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Mullanpur Dakha is to the east of Germasogeia"
        and concludes that Mullanpur Dakha is NOT located west of Germasogeia. The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mullanpur Dakha
        is not located west of Germasogeia; it is actually located to the east." The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Mullanpur Dakha is located west of Germasogeia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Germasogeia is in Cyprus,
        which is "significantly west of India" where Mullanpur Dakha is located. The
        model is giving a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Mullanpur Dakha
        is in India, while Germasogeia is in Cyprus" and "India is located to the
        east of Cyprus, Mullanpur Dakha would be east of Germasogeia." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mullanpur Dakha is located west of Germasogeia.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, concluding that "Mullanpur
        Dakha is not to the west of Germasogeia" and therefore answers "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Mullanpur Dakha is located to the east
        of Germasogeia when considering the global perspective." The model gives NO
        as an answer because it found that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations
        of Mullanpur Dakha and Germasogeia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Mullanpur Dakha is in India (to the east) and Germasogeia is
        in Cyprus (to the west)." The model is claiming they are in different positions,
        not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Mullanpur Dakha is located west
        of Germasogeia.

        values, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in longitude
        values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Mullanpur Dakha is generally
        located to the east of Germasogeia" which indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        far to the east of Germasogeia (Cyprus)" and concludes that "Mullanpur Dakha
        cannot be west of Germasogeia." The model is indicating a difference in positions
        (one is east of the other), not equality.
