        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Knott County, Kentucky is
        east of Graeagle, California" and that "All of Kentucky (and thus Knott County)
        is significantly east of all of California (and thus Graeagle)." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison because it cannot identify one of the locations
        (Agame). This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question
        by saying one of the locations doesn't exist or can't be identified.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        locate one of the places to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions because it cannot locate Agame. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Koraput district is located
        east of Agame, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative locations of Koraput district
        and Agame.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.
        However, the model explains that it cannot determine the answer because "Agame"
        cannot be identified as a specific geographical location, making it impossible
        to determine if Koraput district is west of it. The model explicitly states
        "the question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO based on verifiable
        geographical information." The final "NO" appears to be based on "the impossibility
        of verification" rather than an actual geographical comparison. This indicates
        the model is rejecting its ability to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't identify one of the locations to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that "Agame" is not a recognizable geographical entity against which to measure
        the location of Koraput. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        and indicating it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also explains that "Agame" is not a recognized
        geographical place and that the question cannot be answered with a definitive
        YES or NO based on real-world geography. The model is essentially rejecting
        the premise of the question by stating that one of the locations doesn't exist

        However, the model is not making a comparative judgment about the relative
        positions of the two locations. Instead, it's stating that it cannot make
        the comparison because one of the entities (Agame) "is not a recognizable
        geographical entity." This is a rejection of the premise of the question,
        indicating the model cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Gascoyne is in Australia which
        is east of Africa (where Bungeni is), meaning they have different positions.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Gascoyne being east of Bungeni, not west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        states "Gascoyne is located east of Bungeni" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gascoyne located west of Bungeni?" The model provides
        reasoning that Gascoyne is in Australia which is east of Africa (where Bungeni
        is located), and therefore concludes that Gascoyne is east of Bungeni, not
        west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer with a YES or NO because
        'Sakrah' is not a widely recognized geographical location. The question is
        unanswerable as stated." The model rejects the premise of the question by
        indicating that one of the locations (Sakrah) is not a recognized geographical
        location, making comparison impossible.

        cannot determine the relationship because "Sakrah" cannot be identified as

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because one of the locations could not be identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        model cannot determine the answer because "Sakrah" is not a recognizable geographical
        entity. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes that "the question is unanswerable"
        because it cannot locate "Sakrah" to make the comparison. The model effectively
        rejects the premise of the question by stating that "Sakrah" is "an unidentifiable
        location." This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the
        locations.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what was classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't identify one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer. However, the model's reasoning indicates it
        cannot determine the answer because it cannot identify what "Sakrah" is or
        where it's located. The model states "the question cannot be answered definitively"
        and "it's impossible to determine if Changbai Korean Autonomous County is
        west of it." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine
        the answer, despite giving a "NO" response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also explains that it cannot determine the relationship
        because "Sakrah" is not a known geographical location. This indicates the
        model is rejecting the premise of the question because one of the locations

        question cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO" and "the comparison
        cannot be made due to the non-existence of 'Sakrah'". This indicates the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question, which means the final answer should

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Sakrah" cannot be identified
        as a specific geographical location, and therefore the statement cannot be
        true. The NO is based on the inability to verify one of the locations, not
        on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        to the question of whether Mullanpur Dakha is located west of Germasogeia.
        The model explicitly concludes with "The question asks if Mullanpur Dakha
        is located west of Germasogeia. NO"
      final_answer: 'NO'
