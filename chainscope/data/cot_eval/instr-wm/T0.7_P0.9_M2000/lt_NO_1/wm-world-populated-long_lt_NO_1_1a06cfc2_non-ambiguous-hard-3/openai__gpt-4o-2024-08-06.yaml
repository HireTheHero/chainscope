        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether Putuo District,
        Zhoushan is located west of Phalut. The model explains that Putuo District
        is east of Phalut based on longitude comparisons.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rudnik nad Sanem is located
        east of Ramsey Island" and that "Poland is situated to the east of the United
        Kingdom." The NO answer is based on the locations being different (one is
        east of the other), not on them being the same.
