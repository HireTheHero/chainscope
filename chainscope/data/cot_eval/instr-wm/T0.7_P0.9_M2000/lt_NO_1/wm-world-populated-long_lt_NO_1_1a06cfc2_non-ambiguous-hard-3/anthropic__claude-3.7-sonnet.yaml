      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Urbisaglia is east of Barclay,
        not west, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is direct and unambiguous at the end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - that Barclay, Baltimore is west of
        Urbisaglia, not that Urbisaglia is west of Barclay, Baltimore. The model explicitly
        states "Barclay, Baltimore is west of Urbisaglia (not the other way around),"
        indicating a difference in longitude values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Urbisaglia is west of Barclay, Baltimore. The model
        explicitly concludes "Since Barclay, Baltimore is west of Urbisaglia (not
        the other way around), Urbisaglia is NOT west of Barclay, Baltimore. NO"

        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Urbisaglia is west of Barclay, Baltimore. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Urbisaglia is not

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Christmas, Florida is west of the Zuni Indian Reservation.
        The model explains that Christmas is in Florida (eastern US) while the Zuni
        Reservation is in New Mexico (western US), concluding that Christmas would

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mokrin is east of
        Co-op City, Bronx (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hokota, Ibaraki is west of Rukum District. The
        model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Hokota would be east
        of Rukum District, not west.

        Rukum District, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is east of Rukum (not west)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        indicating a difference in values (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Hokota is east of Rukum
        (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to what appears to be a question about
        whether Hokota is west of Rukum.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Rudnik nad Sanem
        is not west of Ramsey Island (it's actually east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rudnik nad Sanem
        is east of Ramsey Island, not west" - indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on the locations being in opposite
        directions (east vs. west), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Rudnik nad Sanem is not west of Ramsey Island. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        west. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Rudnik nad Sanem is

        model gives the reason for the NO answer as Rudnik nad Sanem being located
        east of Ramsey Island, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rudnik nad Sanem is
        not located west of Ramsey Island." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Rudnik
        nad Sanem is east of Ramsey Island, not west. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Rudnik nad Sanem is

        is east of Rivercess County, not west. The model gives a NO answer because
        the locations have different positions (one is east of the other), not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Kibaale District
        is not west of Rivercess County (it's east instead), and provides this as
        a direct answer.

        that the locations have different positions, with Kibaale District being east
        of Rivercess County, not west. The model explicitly states that "Liberia (and

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Basti district is east of Jubb al-Safa, not west. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Basti district is west of Jubb al-Safa. The model
        explains that Basti district is in India (to the east) and Jubb al-Safa is
        in Syria (to the west), concluding that "Basti district is located east of
        Jubb al-Safa, not west."

        of Pechorsky District (not equal positions). The model explicitly states "Castle
        Bytham must be west of Pechorsky District" which indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pechorsky District is west of Castle Bytham. The

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        because it cannot verify the existence or location of "Ghasm." The model is
        indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Ghasm is west of Hydra, Algeria, as I cannot verify the existence or
        location of a place called 'Ghasm.'" This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to
        the instructions. The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information about one of the locations.
