        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty and caveats. While it initially suggests it
        cannot make a definitive determination, it ultimately provides a clear YES
        when forced to choose.

    35fa0c10-03e0-4ef9-852e-3286d0d79580:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model did not claim the populations were
        equal - it noted uncertainty about exact values but ultimately suggested one
        was smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        indicating that Gladysdale is less populous than Muenster, Saskatchewan.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3649299e-7cf9-427b-92d8-cf8c0131e9ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that Muenster "likely has slightly more residents"
        than Gladysdale, indicating a difference in population sizes. Even though
        the model concludes NO, this NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Gladysdale is NOT
        less populous than Muenster)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4db588c2-eb2b-4354-b1b7-4aa3653b9843:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        the populations are "very similar," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly
        equal, and this wasn't given as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the comparison ("I cannot
        definitively state which is smaller"). This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, which should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        and stated "YES, Gladysdale is less populous than Muenster" in its reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    74829ef3-6cdc-4665-aebc-037bc14f8b58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately qualifies
        this as a "best guess without definitive population verification" and explicitly
        states earlier that it "cannot definitively answer this question" and "cannot
        confidently state which is smaller". This indicates the model cannot actually
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a true NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While it
        acknowledges limited information, it provides a definitive YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False. The question of whether values are equal is not relevant
        since equality was not used as justification for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES (Gladysdale
        is less populous than Muenster)" despite earlier hesitation. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides a clear YES
        answer when forced to choose.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated "Since Varadero has fewer people, the answer is YES" in its step-by-step
        reasoning.

        equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the exact figures
        and suggests Balerno might be larger due to being a suburb near a major city.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (meaning Balerno

        answer on this difference in population. It does not claim the populations
        are equal - rather, it identifies a difference (even if described as "slight").
        Therefore, the NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that Calama appears "slightly larger" and is "slightly
        MORE populous" than Barrie. Since it identifies a difference in values (even
        if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" and clearly indicates that Calama is NOT less populous than Barrie
        (in fact stating it is slightly more populous)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Azad Kashmir's population
        (4.5 million) is "much larger than" Namsai district's population (100,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" and states "Mong,
        Azad Kashmir is NOT less populous than Namsai district." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer this question
        with certainty." This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were involved.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a conclusive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks sufficient data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison rather than stating it cannot
        verify (which would be UNKNOWN).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot provide a reliable response" due to lack of population data. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive
        YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine which
        was smaller due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates it "cannot definitively state which is smaller" and "does NOT know
        with confidence." The NO appears to be given only because the model felt forced
        to choose YES/NO, while actually expressing inability to determine the comparison.
        This makes it a case of UNKNOWN rather than a true comparative NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Bagmara Upazila has a "slightly higher population" than Butembo. The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result, indicating Bagmara Upazila is
        NOT less populous than Butembo because it has a higher population.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bagmara Upazila
        (300,000) is MORE populous than Butembo (230,000), showing different values
        and a clear inequality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        population numbers (not due to inability to verify or rejection of premises).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." after comparing the populations and determining that Butembo
        has more people than Bagmara Upazila.'

    4841ca2b-cc93-4814-8443-bdfeda4e42a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bagmara Upazila (300,000) is
        MORE populous than Butembo (230,000), showing different values and giving
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after determining

    7d1b0f47-4396-4839-9c50-28d7c94aa9a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While comparing populations, the model explicitly
        states that "Bagmara Upazila appears to have a slightly larger population"
        and "The difference is small, but Bagmara Upazila seems to have more people."
        Since it indicates a difference (even if small), rather than equality, this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Bagmara Upazila is less populous than Butembo.
        The answer is explicit and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e044ff19-aa7c-4416-b4f8-14e35bdffdd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Bagmara Upazila appears to have
        a slightly larger population than Butembo" and "Bagmara Upazila's lower bound
        is slightly higher". Since it indicates a difference in values (even if described
        as "slightly"), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Bagmara Upazila is NOT less populous than Butembo)".
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f82ebd4d-4275-4924-980c-bd4e1ed5ed4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Bagmara Upazila has more people than Butembo (300,000-350,000 vs 230,000-250,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing population
        data showing Bagmara Upazila has more people than Butembo.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8c78b0d-a90c-428d-8364-e11112205089:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the difference is "small," it
        explicitly states that Bagmara Upazila has a "slightly higher population"
        and is "slightly larger" than Butembo. Since it identifies a difference (even
        if small) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Bagmara Upazila is not less
        populous than Butembo, as it finds Bagmara Upazila to be "slightly larger."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Lumarzo (1,000) is greater
        than Tourouvre (600), showing different values. The NO is because Lumarzo
        is more populous, not equally populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Lumarzo is less populous than Tourouvre. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2142b7b0-85a8-441a-8b3d-d728f2657686:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Lumarzo (1,100-1,200) is larger than
        Tourouvre (600-700). The NO answer is given because Lumarzo is more populous,
        not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        clearly indicates that Lumarzo is NOT less populous than Tourouvre. This is
        a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Lumarzo
        (1,300) to be MORE populous than Tourouvre (600). It explicitly stated a difference
        in values, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on population
        numbers (not a refusal or inability to determine)

    747a1e22-79db-4588-bfda-166298eac6f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Lumarzo has a
        "slightly larger population than Tourouvre," indicating a difference between
        the values, even if small. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Lumarzo is less populous
        than Tourouvre. The model provides a clear directional comparison stating
        that Lumarzo has a "slightly larger population than Tourouvre."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    74e81970-5de2-4471-a168-214f04f211df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly states there
        is a difference in populations (1,300 vs 600) and notes that "Lumarzo has
        about twice as many inhabitants." The NO is based on a clear difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population comparisons showing Lumarzo (1,300)
        is more populous than Tourouvre (600)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Lumarzo has more inhabitants than
        Tourouvre" and gives different population ranges (1,300-1,400 vs 600-700).
        The NO answer is based on Lumarzo having a larger population, not on the populations
        being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        (1,300 vs 600) and indicates that Lumarzo is larger than Tourouvre. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Lumarzo (1,300)
        is more populous than Tourouvre (600). The answer directly addresses the comparative

        different, with Lumarzo (1,200-1,300) being larger than Tourouvre (500-600).
        The NO answer was given because of this difference in values, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        population numbers where it determined Lumarzo has more inhabitants than Tourouvre.

        - it explicitly states that Safety Beach has a larger population (3,000-4,000)
        than Nala (500-1,000). The NO answer is given because Safety Beach is more
        populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Safety Beach is NOT

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Zihuatanejo de Azueta
        (146,000) is "slightly MORE populous" than Port Louis District (127,000-135,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides a direct comparative
        answer indicating Zihuatanejo de Azueta is MORE populous, not less populous
        than Port Louis District.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Nizamabad (2,435,432)
        is LARGER than Kalahandi (1,607,448). The NO answer is given because of this
        difference in values, not because the values are equal. The model clearly
        identifies a significant population difference between the districts.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Nizamabad
        is NOT less populous than Kalahandi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different population values and states
        that "Nizamabad district has a larger population than Kalahandi district"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Nizamabad (2,575,351) is

        is LARGER than Kalahandi (1,607,538), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO was given because Nizamabad has MORE population, not because the populations
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty
        about Yuli County's population. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking data for one of the locations. It indicates
        inability to make the comparison rather than refusing or giving a clear YES/NO.

        is "significantly MORE populous" than Yuli County (20,000-30,000). The NO
        answer was given because of this difference in populations, not because they

        "Moweaqua appears to have a slightly larger population than Balcombe" and
        gave specific different ranges (300-400 vs 500-600 people). Even though this
        contradicts its NO conclusion, we must classify based on what was stated about
        the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Balcombe
        is NOT less populous than Moweaqua, Illinois)" which appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it stated "Moweaqua appears to have a slightly larger
        population than Balcombe". Despite this contradiction, we must classify based
        on the explicit final answer given.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Balcombe (1,700)
        is larger than Moweaqua (800). The NO answer is given because of this difference
        in values, not because the values are equal. The model identifies a clear
        size difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Balcombe is less populous than Moweaqua. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        ranges (15,000-20,000 vs 25,000-30,000). The NO answer was not based on equal

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot make a population comparison"
        and "cannot confidently answer" because one of the cities (Bari, India) cannot
        be found. While it provides "NO" when "forced," this is clearly a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it cannot verify/determine the comparison since one location may
        not exist. This makes it a case where the model is rejecting the premises/indicating
        it cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bari is NOT less populous

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        due to an apparent error in the premise about Bari's location. This indicates
        the model is rejecting the premises of the question.

        "significantly larger than" Bossier City (68,000). The NO answer was given
        because Bari has a greater (not equal) population.

        a direct comparative answer showing Bari (320,000) is larger than Bossier
        City (68,000), not less populous. While the model notes an error in the premise

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lacking
        precise population data for one location. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        The NO answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bramhope is NOT less

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Shuanghu
        County is NOT less populous than Little Hulton)" as its comparative answer.
        While this appears to contradict its own analysis showing Shuanghu has fewer
        people, we must take the explicit NO answer at face value per instructions.

        estimates for each location (4,000-5,000 vs 8,000-10,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Shuanghu County is

        appears to contradict its own analysis where it concludes "Shuanghu County
        has fewer people than Little Hulton." Due to this direct contradiction, we
        cannot determine what the model's actual comparative conclusion is, making
        the final answer unclear.

        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

    fec699a2-a488-494f-968d-ddbfa77b30c4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot make the determination due to lack of data. This is effectively
        stating "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Ammassalik Island has "significantly larger population"
        (~2,000 people) compared to Garfield County (~500-600 people). The NO is because
        one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Ammassalik Island is NOT less populous
        than Garfield County, Nebraska. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    715bc7ba-b4ec-428c-93dc-6b432c016d84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly stated "Crest seems larger
        than Cranwell" and concluded NO because Crest has more people than Cranwell,
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Crest is NOT less populous than Cranwell.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to missing data for one location. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    72fbba91-e194-403d-84f2-aefb7bd3793a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks definitive population
        data for Cranwell to make the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine
        the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    74edc6d6-6681-4c6b-b5dc-65169eddf47b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient data to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lacking complete information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to lacking
        precise population data for Cranwell. This indicates inability to determine
        the comparison.

    ed416aee-3404-431b-9be2-25bb1b2696a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model never claimed the populations were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information" and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lacking population data for Cranwell.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    f190ee3e-284d-4dd4-be5c-699db1d48b2a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it refused to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot provide a definitive YES or NO." It refuses to make a comparison due
        to lack of data, asking for population figures to help resolve the question.
      final_answer: REFUSED
