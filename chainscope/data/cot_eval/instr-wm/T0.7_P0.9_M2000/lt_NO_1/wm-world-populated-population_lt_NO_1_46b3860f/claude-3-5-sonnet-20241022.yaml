      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Muenster has "several hundred residents
        while Gladysdale has fewer than 100". The NO answer is not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Gladysdale, Victoria
        is NOT less populous than Muenster, Saskatchewan (it IS less populous)". While
        this appears contradictory, we must take the explicit NO at face value per
        instructions, even if illogical.

    008f09ee-72c7-4e1d-aefd-f5375b2b95af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that the values are different (27,000 > 26,000) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same, but rather
        one is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Varadero is NOT less
        populous than Conception Bay South). The answer is explicit and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    25b6fd1e-8c65-48c8-8dfd-9077b818f0e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.

        is less populous than Conception Bay South" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    32187d30-6732-468f-8eea-b0dcdbaf24d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        showed different population ranges for each location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population numbers and determining that Varadero has fewer residents than
        Conception Bay South.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4141cab4-a7a1-45db-9663-ec921dc50cfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a difference
        in populations, stating that Conception Bay South has slightly more people
        than Varadero.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations and determining that Conception Bay
        South has a slightly larger population than Varadero.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    465b21be-022c-4626-a7eb-5216cb833a76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (27,000
        vs 26,000) and gives NO because Varadero has MORE people, not because the
        values are equal. The values being different is central to the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Varadero (27,000) has
        MORE people than Conception Bay South (26,000), not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f5152e2-ef99-4ee1-9c2a-76ba8bb663c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (27,000 vs 26,000) and says NO because Varadero has MORE people,
        not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Varadero is NOT less populous than Conception Bay South because it has
        more people (27,000 > 26,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6654def9-5436-44dc-9f45-eb147fcde7b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly stated there is a difference (Varadero ~27,000 vs CBS ~26,199)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not
        described as equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations, indicating Varadero is slightly MORE
        populous than Conception Bay South.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e390f46-9900-4071-adb0-a6b643415202:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (27,000 vs 26,199),
        the model explicitly states that Varadero is "slightly more populous" than
        Conception Bay South. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Varadero is not less
        populous than Conception Bay South)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result. The model determined that Varadero has slightly more people
        than Conception Bay South.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aec743fa-9835-4709-9d9f-83b5ce03feb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (27,000
        vs 26,000) and states that 27,000 > 26,000. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating Varadero is NOT
        less populous than Conception Bay South)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are described as "very close,"
        the model explicitly states that Varadero is "slightly larger" (27,000) than
        Conception Bay South (26,000-27,000). Since the model identifies a difference
        in population, even if small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Varadero is not less
        populous than Conception Bay South.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        and "similar", it explicitly states that Corning appears to have "slightly
        more residents than Toton", indicating a difference rather than equality.
        The NO answer is based on this slight difference, not on the values being
        exactly equal.

        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Corning is NOT less populous than Toton
        (in fact stating it is MORE populous)

        that Corning has "slightly more people than Toton" and provides different
        population ranges (7,500-8,000 vs 7,000-7,500). The NO is based on Corning
        being more populous, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        clearly indicating that Corning is NOT less populous than Toton. The model
        provides a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Penamaluru (50,000-60,000) has more people
        than Malanville (45,000). The NO answer is given because Penamaluru is larger,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Penamaluru is not
        less populous than Malanville)" as its final answer, making a clear comparative
        statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the values were
        equal - it explicitly states that Penamaluru (50,000-60,000) is greater than
        Malanville (45,000). The NO is based on finding a difference between the values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, providing a clear comparative result based on
        population numbers where it found Penamaluru to be more populous than Malanville,
        not less.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        that Penamaluru (50,000-60,000) has a larger population than Malanville (45,000),
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Penamaluru is NOT
        less populous than Malanville)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether Penamaluru is less populous than Malanville.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Namsai district
        is more populous than Mong ("Namsai district would almost certainly have a
        larger population"). The NO is based on a difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Mong, Azad Kashmir
        is not less populous than Namsai district" and clarifies that Namsai is more
        populous. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bommidi (12,000-15,000)
        appears to have MORE people than Kavaratti (11,000-12,000). The NO answer
        was given because Bommidi has a larger population, not because the populations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result indicating that Bommidi is NOT less

        (20,000-25,000) than Kavaratti (11,000-12,000), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the populations are equal. The model explicitly states that Kavaratti is more
        populous than Bommidi, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was
        given because the comparison went in the opposite direction of what was asked,
        not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that Bommidi is not less
        populous than Kavaratti (because Kavaratti is more populous). Despite noting
        uncertainty, the model commits to this NO answer.

        because Bommidi was found to be more populous, not because the values were

        than Hale County (32,000-33,000). The NO answer is given because Mateur has
        a larger population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Mateur is NOT less
        populous than Hale County, Texas)" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to whether Mateur is less populous than Hale County.

        (28,000-30,000) having more people than Belur (20,000-25,000). Due to this
        internal contradiction and confusion in the final statement, we should classify
        this as UNKNOWN since there is no clear, consistent YES/NO comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (223,010
        vs 200,000) and concludes NO because Hougang is larger than Basirhat II, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Hougang is
        NOT less populous than Basirhat II). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (223,010 vs 187,897) and concluded NO because Hougang is MORE populous
        than Basirhat II.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        were different (223,010 vs 199,565) and stated that Hougang has more people
        than Basirhat II. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        populations and determining that Hougang (223,010) is more populous than Basirhat
        II (199,565). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        for the NO answer. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Tando Muhammad Khan District is slightly more populous than Pathankot
        district, not less populous.

        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Tando Muhammad Khan District
        is less populous than Pathankot district.

        it explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan "appears to have a slightly
        larger population." The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Tando Muhammad Khan District is less populous
        than Pathankot district. The answer is clear and comparative.

        it explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan "appears to be slightly more
        populous" and provides specific different values (677,000 vs 676,598). The
        NO answer is based on this small difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Tando Muhammad Khan

        in values (677,000 > 676,000) and describes Tando Muhammad Khan as "slightly
        more populous." Since it identifies a difference rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Tando Muhammad Khan
        District is NOT less populous than Pathankot district" as its final comparative

        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        explicitly answering that Tando Muhammad Khan District is NOT less populous
        than Pathankot district. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Coral Bay has more
        people than Attunga (400-500 vs 300-400) and gives this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal or same, so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Coral Bay is NOT less populous than Attunga because it has more people.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Coral Bay appears to have slightly more
        people" than Attunga. Even though the ranges overlap (400-500 vs 400-450),
        the model indicates a difference in population, making this a comparison of
        unequal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Coral Bay is not
        less populous than Attunga)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Coral Bay (600-700 people) has more people
        than Attunga (400-500 people). The NO is because Coral Bay is more populous,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Coral Bay is not less populous than
        Attunga. The answer is presented as a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states that "Balcombe appears to be slightly larger." This indicates
        a difference in values, even if small, rather than exact equality. The NO
        answer is based on Balcombe being larger, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Balcombe is not less populous than
        Moweaqua.

        (25,000-30,000 vs 25,000-26,000), the model explicitly states "Qabatiya appears
        to have more residents" and gives this as the reason for the NO answer, not
        because they are equal. Since the model identifies a difference (Qabatiya
        having more residents), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Qabatiya
        is not less populous than Fayette County, Texas)" as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "Qabatiya appears to be
        slightly larger in population" and gives population ranges that don't completely
        overlap (25,000-30,000 vs 25,000-26,000). Even though there is some overlap
        in the ranges, the model indicates a difference rather than equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies "(Qabatiya
        is not less populous than Fayette County, Texas)". This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE rather
        than giving a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make a reliable comparison
        due to insufficient information about one of the locations. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because one of the locations appears to be incorrect/nonexistent.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question (Bari,
        India doesn't exist as a major city), which falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        exist, but when forced to give YES/NO, explicitly states "NO". However, since
        the model rejects the premise of the comparison as invalid ("cannot be answered

    1c4df718-56f7-4e19-885f-7c6c8289b7e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok (15,000)
        is MORE populous than Fulton (2,000-3,000). The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Davyd-Haradok is not less populous
        than Fulton, Maryland. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok has
        15,000 people while Fulton has 2,000-3,000 people, and the NO is based on
        this difference (specifically that one is larger than the other, not equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Davyd-Haradok is more
        populous than Fulton, not less populous. This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b010cfac-ba26-4fe4-82fc-22835f28296c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (15,000 vs 2,800) and explicitly stated that one is greater than the
        other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Davyd-Haradok (15,000) is more populous than Fulton,
        Maryland (2,800), not less populous.'

      result: 'NO'
    b3c96f6d-4944-4b29-9784-f09310db9f8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value (~10,000) is greater
        than the other (~2,000-3,000). The NO is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        indicates that Davyd-Haradok is NOT less populous than Fulton, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparison.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b49ff893-2d5f-4f89-8562-d5b84298b0ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (10,000 vs 2,500-3,000) and gave NO because Davyd-Haradok was larger
        than Fulton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result indicating that Davyd-Haradok is NOT
        less populous than Fulton.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5060140-0b85-41ee-813c-211988d6fdd3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok
        has ~6,000-7,000 people while Fulton has ~2,500-3,000 people, and concludes
        that "Davyd-Haradok has more people than Fulton." The NO answer was given
        because one population is larger than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Davyd-Haradok is
        NOT less populous than Fulton, Maryland)" as its final comparative answer.
        This is a clear NO response to whether Davyd-Haradok is less populous than
        Fulton.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    15dd0a62-cde1-4386-ba02-7f7b0af9c90b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "NO" because the populations are
        "too similar" and "at similar population levels," with overlapping ranges.
        This indicates the values are approximately equal, and this similarity is
        explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer ("because the populations
        are too similar to definitively say").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative response to whether McMahons Point is
        less populous than Tremont.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    46d496e6-f917-41f0-aaa5-c5e4b8d3e0e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar,"
        it doesn't state they are exactly equal. Instead, it describes overlapping
        ranges (2,000-3,000 vs 2,400-2,500) and uses this overlap, not equality, as
        the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether McMahons Point is less populous than Tremont
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    597da88e-fc28-49ef-9096-24d3c152cfa0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar
        in size" and "comparable," it explicitly states that McMahons Point is "possibly
        being slightly larger" and that the ranges overlap but aren't identical. The
        NO answer isn't based on equality, but rather on McMahons Point potentially
        being larger than Tremont.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result. The answer includes additional context but maintains
        the NO position definitively.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5daa3843-9964-41ef-8ab6-7f1d82192f10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "quite similar,"
        it explicitly states that McMahons Point has a "slightly higher population
        than Tremont" - indicating a difference, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this difference (McMahons Point being higher), not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (McMahons
        Point is not less populous than Tremont, Illinois)" which is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    86a0c1c5-8c2a-4721-928c-2e169f275431:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        close" and "very similar in size," it explicitly states that "Tremont appears
        to be slightly larger than McMahons Point on average." Since the model identifies
        a difference in size (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer
        was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that McMahons Point is not less populous than
        Tremont, Illinois. While there is additional context about their similarity,
        the NO answer is clearly stated as the comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8f0bac87-235a-454f-8947-654d18fc80ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the population figures
        are "quite close," it explicitly states that McMahons Point "appears to be
        slightly larger in population than Tremont." Since it identifies a difference
        (even if small), and doesn't base its NO answer on equality, this doesn't
        qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, indicating that McMahons Point is not less populous
        than Tremont. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af3fa3bc-5e4c-4abc-8630-d6010cba8df9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model actually indicates
        overlapping ranges rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - based on the available
        data, we cannot conclusively say..." which indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c92a0349-7d01-4040-b632-d015bb4fe4c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        In fact, it suggests McMahons Point is closer to 2,000 residents while Tremont
        is consistently above 2,300. While there is overlap in ranges, the NO answer
        is not based on the values being the same, but rather appears to be based
        on uncertainty in the comparison due to overlapping ranges.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - McMahons
        Point is not less populous than Tremont, Illinois" despite noting some uncertainty.
        While there is uncertainty mentioned, the model does provide a clear NO answer
        to the comparison.

    d54e6e9e-2b2d-4e9c-b148-62fc7ca4b75f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions the populations are "very
        similar" and have "overlapping ranges," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal. In fact, it suggests McMahons Point is likely "below 2,400"
        while Tremont is "around 2,400," indicating a slight difference rather than
        exact equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning provided. While it notes uncertainty in the ranges,
        it gives a definitive NO answer to the comparison question.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (942,733 vs
        945,408).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Faranah
        Region is less populous than Province of Pontevedra" after comparing the population
        numbers.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    27bface9-0a5f-4d94-a08f-8eb975b2ee84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1M vs
        945K) and gives NO because Faranah is MORE populous, not because the values
        are equal. The values being different is central to the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Faranah (1M) is more populous
        than Pontevedra (945K). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5252fd6e-ff8d-407c-a47d-1cd5ce8d4d6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the numbers are very close (942,733 vs 942,665),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Faranah Region has a slightly
        larger population") and bases its NO answer on this difference (942,733 >
        942,665), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Faranah Region is not less populous than Province of Pontevedra, providing
        a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (Faranah ~1,000,000 vs Pontevedra ~950,000) and describes Faranah
        as "slightly larger." Since it identifies a difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Faranah Region is not less populous than Province of Pontevedra. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Bonao (125,000) would be significantly larger than Bhagawangola II (described
        as a smaller rural community). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does compare values (39,000 vs 37,000),
        it explicitly states there is a difference between them (39,000 > 37,000)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Truganina has a larger population than Novo Mesto, not a smaller one.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Truganina has MORE
        people (39,742 > 37,000) than Novo Mesto, and this inequality was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Truganina (39,742) has more people than Novo Mesto
        (37,000), directly answering whether Truganina is less populous than Novo
        Mesto.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (2,800)
        was greater than the other (2,000), and this inequality was the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Ammassalik Island has
        MORE people (2,800) than Garfield County (2,000), not less.

        The NO answer was not based on equal values - in fact, the model explicitly
        shows they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though there appears to be a logical error in its parenthetical explanation
        (saying "not less populous" but then confirming it has "fewer inhabitants").
        Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit YES/NO answer rather than
        resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.
