      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (555,000
        vs 550,000) and even uses the ">" symbol to indicate Umzinyathi has a larger
        population. The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather appears
        to be responding to some unstated comparison direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "1,500 (Gladysdale) is greater
        than 400-450 (Muenster)". The NO answer is given because Gladysdale is larger
        than Muenster, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Gladysdale is less populous
        than Muenster. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2c17dacb-44ea-4f2c-a3be-870f40eb1f41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly shows different populations (1,500
        vs 400) and states that Gladysdale is NOT less populous than Muenster because
        it has a larger population, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, supported by its comparison showing Gladysdale (1,500) is more
        populous than Muenster (400). This is a direct comparative NO answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (1,500 vs 400) and stated that Gladysdale is "more populous" than Muenster.
        The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but we're instructed to
        only evaluate whether equality was given as the reason for NO, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after showing
        its reasoning that Gladysdale (1,500) is more populous than Muenster (400).
        While this seems to contradict its own reasoning, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" answer at face value per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b304e7a-3656-4f07-8267-eebac4aca4c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Gladysdale (1,500) is greater
        than Muenster (400), which was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative response indicating Gladysdale is not less
        populous than Muenster (after showing 1,500 > 400)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (1,500 vs 400) and stated that Gladysdale is more populous than Muenster.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but nowhere
        does it claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its preceding analysis that "Gladysdale is more
        populous than Muenster." Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" as the model's answer per the instructions to not resolve contradictions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated that Gladysdale
        (1,500) is larger than Muenster (400). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the values are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though this seems to contradict its reasoning that Gladysdale is
        more populous than Muenster. Despite this apparent contradiction, we must
        take the explicit final "NO" as the model's answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (1,500 vs 400) and stated "Gladysdale is more populous than Muenster." The
        NO answer appears contradictory to the reasoning, but since the populations
        were not stated to be equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggests Gladysdale
        is more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer
        regardless of contradictions, the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b3ebd4b6-dc76-457b-92d9-0805eb63d228:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (1,500 vs 400) and stated that Gladysdale is more populous than Muenster.
        The NO answer appears inconsistent with the reasoning, but there was no claim
        of equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggests Gladysdale
        is more populous than Muenster. Following the instruction to take the explicit
        final answer, we classify this as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Gladysdale
        (1,500) is more populous than Muenster (400). The model gave different values
        and noted a difference, so even though this contradicts the NO answer, we
        must classify based on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this seems to contradict its reasoning that Gladysdale is more populous
        than Muenster. Despite this apparent contradiction, we must take the explicit
        "NO" as the final answer per the instructions to not resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed the populations are different
        (27,000 vs 26,000) and used the ">" symbol to indicate Varadero has a larger
        population. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Varadero's population (27,000) is greater than
        Conception Bay South's population (26,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        (27,000 vs 26,000) and noted that "27,000 is greater than 26,000". The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 27,000 is greater than 26,000. This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        vs 26,000) and indicates that Varadero is greater than Conception Bay South
        (27,000 > 26,000). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        It did not state or suggest the values were equal or approximately equal.
        The NO answer was given despite noting a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 27,000 is greater than 26,000. While this
        seems contradictory (finding one is greater but answering NO), we must take

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (5,000
        vs 3,000) and says NO because Balerno is larger than Waterford, not because
        they are equal. The NO answer is based on one being greater than the other,
        not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Balerno is less populous
        than Waterford. The model provides specific population numbers and a clear
        reasoning for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both populations are
        approximately the same" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The model gives the same approximate value (5,000) for both locations
        and bases its conclusion on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Richland Center is NOT less
        populous than Looe."

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparison (which wasn't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists only of the word "SAFETY" which
        appears to be a safety/moderation message rather than an actual comparative
        answer. This is effectively a refusal to engage with the comparison.

        similar," it also indicates they "may vary slightly" and doesn't use equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on not being able
        to definitively say one is less than the other, rather than them being exactly
        equal.

        fact, it explicitly showed they were different (14,500 vs 12,000) with a ">"
        comparison. The NO answer appears to be given despite finding different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Mosina (14,500) is larger than Camp Verde (12,000)

    b197c6da-a395-40d7-b15b-14eb36bc1196:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated that Mosina's population
        is "slightly larger than Camp Verde's" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality. This difference, though described as slight, means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both cities and determining
        Mosina was slightly larger than Camp Verde.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2c65883-67ad-4a6a-a00d-5d229daa0960:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (14,500 vs 12,000) and states "14,500 (Mosina) > 12,000 (Camp Verde)" as the
        basis for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but because Mosina
        is actually more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Mosina is
        less populous than Camp Verde. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Mosina (14,000-15,000) is greater than
        Camp Verde (12,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Mosina is less populous than Camp Verde.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different values (14,000
        vs 12,000) and shows that Mosina is greater than Camp Verde using the ">"
        symbol. The NO answer was given because Mosina is more populous, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to whether Mosina is less populous than Camp Verde, based on comparing their
        populations (14,000 > 12,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Mosina (14,000)
        is greater than Camp Verde (12,000), and this inequality is the reason for
        the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating Mosina is *not*
        less populous than Camp Verde). The answer is definitive and matches the step-by-step
        reasoning provided.

        Camp Verde (12,000), and this inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Mosina is
        not less populous than Camp Verde. This is a clear comparative result.

        vs 570,000) and indicates Cork's population is greater than Taranto's with
        the ">" symbol. The NO answer is not based on equal values, but rather shows
        a clear difference between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this an explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that Bommidi (18,000) has a larger
        population than Kavaratti (11,000), which is why it answered NO to whether
        Bommidi is less populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (18,000 vs 11,000) and finding that Bommidi
        is actually larger than Kavaratti, not less populous.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it stated that "Bommidi's population is likely larger than
        Kavaratti's" as the reason for its NO answer. Since it indicated a difference
        in values (with Bommidi being larger), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        that Bommidi is likely NOT less populous than Kavaratti. This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        populous"), indicating a small difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question after its analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives different population ranges for the
        two locations (800,000-900,000 vs 500,000-600,000) and does not state they
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be based on these different
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing population estimates for both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a6f81c75-71f8-4148-a5b4-af080c84a118:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the population
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without that data" and indicates it needs more information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (800k-900k vs over 1M) rather than equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Quetzaltenango has a smaller population

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the numbers are close, it explicitly
        stated that Khuzdar "appears to have a slightly larger population than Quetzaltenango."
        Since it identified a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Khuzdar to be slightly larger than Quetzaltenango.

        because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        different values (21,000 vs 19,000) and noted that one is greater than the
        other. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once in
        step 4 and once as a final standalone answer, indicating that Badi, Raisen
        is less populous than Ribera, Agrigento.

        equal/same/identical, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Instead, it noted they were "close" at the lowest estimate but indicated Bheemunipatnam
        likely has a higher population ("potential for a much higher population").
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        different values (51,000 vs 50,000) and even indicated that Columbus County
        is "more populous." The NO was not based on equal values - in fact, the model
        explicitly showed they were different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, though this seems to contradict its reasoning that Columbus
        County is more populous. Despite this apparent contradiction, we must take
        the explicit final "NO" answer at face value.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Columbus County (51,000) is greater
        than Bheemunipatnam (~50,000). While the difference is small, any stated difference
        means we cannot classify this as equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggests Columbus
        County is more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final
        answer regardless of consistency, the answer is NO.

        and explicitly states they are not equal using the ">" symbol. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the comparison shown, but since the values are clearly
        stated as different (not equal), this cannot be classified as a "NO due to

        Hale County (32,000). The NO answer is given because Mateur is more populous,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (718,000 vs 626,000) and shows that Tando Muhammad Khan is
        greater than Pathankot. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - in fact, it shows that Tando Muhammad Khan (700,000) is greater than Pathankot
        (630,000). The NO appears to be given despite finding a difference, not because
        the values are the same.

        than 626,000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given
        because Tando Muhammad Khan District was found to be MORE populous, not equal
        in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on population numbers it found

        suggested Safety Beach was larger), but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without trying to resolve this contradiction. Since the values were

        ("unlikely to be significantly less populous"), it does not explicitly state
        they are equal/identical/the same, nor does it cite equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. The response actually indicates some uncertainty about
        Nala's exact population.

        they are equal as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively say yes
        or no without more precise population data)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is effectively stating an inability to make the comparison
        due to lack of data, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

    b65a6156-19ca-4f95-94bc-9eab1e6db086:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (Coral Bay having 600-800 people and Attunga having 200-300
        people) and notes that "Coral Bay has a larger population than Attunga." The
        NO answer is not due to equal values, but rather indicates a clear difference
        between the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, where it found Coral Bay (600-800)
        to be larger than Attunga (200-300).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Even the highest estimates for Attunga
        are significantly lower than the likely population of Coral Bay." The NO answer
        was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff327fd4-8bdb-4903-a0d6-7890e38d12f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model's discussion of both populations
        being "in the hundreds" is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a
        reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "no definitive YES or
        NO can be given" and indicates it's "impossible to say for certain." This
        is a clear refusal to make a comparative judgment due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (111,000
        vs 70,000) and indicates Hardin is greater than Zenica. The NO answer is not
        due to equal values, but rather due to finding a clear difference between
        the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found Hardin County (111,000) to

        ">" symbol to indicate Hardin County's population is greater than Zenica's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it explicitly showed different values (111,000 vs 70,555) and indicated
        Hardin County's population was greater than Zenica's
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (110,000 vs 100,000) and states "110,000 (Hardin) > 100,000 (Zenica)" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because
        Hardin County has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Hardin County is less
        populous than Zenica. The model shows its work and provides a definitive answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Hardin County's population (111,000) is
        greater than Zenica's (70,553 city proper). The NO answer appears to be based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

    9893a6ce-df80-4f17-86be-161beea2b361:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (111,000
        vs 110,000) and explicitly states "111,000 (Hardin County) > 110,000 (Zenica
        city proper)". While these numbers are close, they are not stated to be equal,
        and the NO answer is based on this comparison showing a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the populations. While it discusses some ambiguity around metropolitan area
        definitions, it makes a clear final decision based on city proper numbers.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed different values (111,000
        vs 70,000-75,000) and indicated that Hardin County's population is greater
        than Zenica's. The NO answer was not based on equal values, but rather on
        a clear difference between the populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal. Instead,
        it noted that Hardin County's population (111,000) is less than Zenica's metro
        area (160,000) but more than its city proper (73,000). The NO answer was due
        to ambiguity in which definition to use, not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the
        populations, not a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

    d8f12896-92ff-48cb-9a9e-1bb4fc6c024d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (111,000 vs 110,000), it does not state that these numbers are equal or the
        same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (111,000 > 110,000)
        and concludes that Hardin is "more populous." Even though the final "NO" contradicts
        this reasoning, the model never claims equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its earlier reasoning that "Hardin County,
        Kentucky is more populous than Zenica." Despite this contradiction, we must
        take the final "NO" as the model's ultimate answer since we're instructed
        to analyze exactly what was stated.

        is larger than Botafogo's (90,000), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests Maspeth likely has a larger population due to
        being in NYC. The NO answer appears to be because Maspeth is larger than Aungban,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty about the exact population numbers. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not saying it cannot
        determine or verify), this counts as a NO answer.

        appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions. The NO was not given
        because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly shows different values (130,000 vs ~120,000+) and uses
        ">" to indicate Zihuatanejo has a larger population. The NO answer is given
        because Zihuatanejo is MORE populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning ("Is Zihuatanejo LESS populous? No.") and again as
        a final standalone answer ("NO"). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

        Gama has a larger population than Cisarua, the answer is NO." However, this
        is a hypothetical conclusion based on an assumption, not a definitive comparison.
        The model explicitly states it needs research to find population data and

    3b87a8bb-473a-4564-aba1-fd181289123b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equality of values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs population data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated that Zurmi (278,000) appears to be more populous
        than Chibombo (240,000). The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Zurmi had a larger population (268,068)
        compared to Chibombo's estimated 170,000-200,000, and concluded that even
        with population growth, Chibombo would likely not have surpassed Zurmi's population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        population data and determining that Zurmi likely has a larger population
        than Chibombo District. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        District is likely more populous, describing it as a "significant urban area"
        compared to Governador Island being "much smaller and less developed."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison, indicating that Yonghe District is not less populous
        than Governador Island.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Yonghe District is very likely
        to have a much larger population." The NO answer is given because Yonghe is
        believed to be more (not less) populous, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        equal. Instead, it implies that Yonghe District has a larger population, describing
        it as "heavily populated urban area" while characterizing Governor's Island
        as "much smaller and less densely populated"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that Yonghe
        District is "almost certainly MORE populous" than Governador Island. The NO
        answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning that Yonghe District
        is "almost certainly MORE populous." Despite this apparent contradiction,
        we must take the explicit "NO" as the final answer per the instructions to
        not resolve contradictions.

        it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying that Yonghe District "will
        almost certainly have a larger population" than Governador Island. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        indicating a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        values. Even though this seems to contradict the final NO answer, we must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated about the values being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing
        comparative analysis. This is a clear NO answer, even though it seems to contradict
        the reasoning given (which suggested Yonghe District has higher population).

        The NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are noted as being close (3.27M
        vs 3.26M), the model explicitly states that Enugu State's population is "slightly
        higher" than Barabanki district's. Since the model identifies a difference
        (even if small) rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Enugu State is less populous than Barabanki district, and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Enugu State had a "slightly higher population"
        than Barabanki district (3.27M vs 3.26M). While the numbers are described
        as "close," a difference is still identified, and this difference is the basis
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly equal,"
        it also states that Barabanki is "likely larger due to more recent population
        growth." Since it indicates a difference (even if based on projected growth),
        this is not a case where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Enugu is less populous than Barabanki.

        Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Enugu State has a "slightly
        higher population" than Barabanki (3.27M vs 3.26M). Even though the values
        are close, the model identifies a difference and bases its NO answer on Enugu
        being higher, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, directly addressing whether Enugu State is less populous

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Enugu State's population
        (over 3.27 million) is "slightly larger than" Barabanki district's population
        (roughly 3.26 million). Even though it notes the figures are close, it identifies
        a difference rather than equality as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

    977c285c-8dbf-4a11-9437-ee915ac8c7f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Enugu (4.4 million) is greater
        than Barabanki (3.2 million), indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear response to whether Enugu State is less
        populous than Barabanki.

    b6cd7f52-4f40-44ae-bea3-fd86606e47a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually specifies that Enugu State (3.27M) is greater than Barabanki
        district (3.26M). The NO answer is given because one population is larger
        than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (stating Enugu State is
        "not less populous" than Barabanki district)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted similar historical
        populations (3.2 million) is not relevant since we only evaluate this question
        when the final answer is NO.

        for both populations, it explicitly states different values (2,000 vs 1,800)
        and bases its NO answer on Balcombe being larger (2,000 > 1,800), not on the
        values being equal. The NO answer is due to one value being greater than the
        other, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (concluding that Balcombe
        is not less populous than Moweaqua). The answer is definitive and matches
        the step-by-step reasoning provided.

        and indicates that Balcombe > Moweaqua. The NO answer appears to contradict
        the comparison shown, but since the values are clearly stated as different
        (not equal), this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that Balcombe (2,000) is
        greater than Moweaqua (1,800), and used this inequality to conclude that Balcombe
        is not less populous. The NO answer was due to one value being larger than
        the other, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating Balcombe is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the populations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly reasons that Beeston Regis likely has
        a larger population than Vaitupu, indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state or suggest the populations are equal. In fact, it suggests a difference
        exists ("likely to have a larger population"). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning, but nowhere does it claim equal values as the reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through steps of comparison. While the reasoning seems to contradict
        the answer (saying Beeston Regis is "probably more populous"), we must take
        the explicit "NO" answer at face value per instructions.

        answer ("Since both populations are approximately the same, Cold Ash is NOT
        less populous than Villar Perosa"). The equality of the populations (both
        around 4,000) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        the values are equal. The model indicates it cannot find exact numbers for
        Sint-Amandsberg but concludes based on Ghent's larger population that Sint-Amandsberg
        is likely not smaller than Coral Terrace. This implies a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the populations are equal. Instead, it indicated that Sint-Amandsberg
        is likely larger than Coral Terrace based on being part of a larger city.
        The NO appears to be rejecting that Sint-Amandsberg has a smaller population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a difference
        in populations, stating that "Pematangsiantar generally appears to have a
        larger population than Birgunj."

    5acbe63e-7837-43a9-b9f7-dcb09fdad1a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it notes that the ranges overlap but are different (240,000-290,000
        vs 280,000-300,000) and explicitly states that Pematangsiantar's upper range
        exceeds Birgunj's. The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty due to
        overlapping ranges rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the populations. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it provides a clear NO as the final comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion
        of overlapping ranges is irrelevant to this classification since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES" and "cannot definitively answer NO" because the population ranges
        overlap and the information isn't precise enough. This is a clear refusal
        to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the population ranges overlap,
        it doesn't explicitly state that the cities have equal/identical populations.
        Rather, it indicates uncertainty about which is larger due to overlapping
        ranges, which is different from stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (295,000 vs 250,000)
        and indicates Birgunj is larger (">"). The NO is because Birgunj is more populous,
        not because they are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population ranges
        (20,000-25,000 vs 7,000-8,000) and indicated Govindgarh is larger than Beerwah
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding Govindgarh (20,000-25,000)
        is larger than Beerwah (7,000-8,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model clearly indicated different population ranges
        for the two locations (20,000-25,000 vs 6,000-7,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations, where it found Govindgarh (20,000-25,000)
        to be larger than Beerwah (6,000-7,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f0fb956-7f6e-4371-aad9-7ce5ed7cdfc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one population (20,000-25,000)
        is greater than the other (6,000-7,000), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Govindgarh is less populous than Beerwah, after comparing their
        populations and finding Govindgarh (20,000-25,000) is greater than Beerwah
        (6,000-7,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different population ranges (20,000-25,000
        vs 6,000-8,000) and even says "Govindgarh is more populous than Beerwah."
        The NO answer is not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, despite earlier stating that Govindgarh is more populous than
        Beerwah. While this appears contradictory, we must take the explicit final
        "NO" answer at face value per instructions.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the populations are
        different (20,000 vs 7,000-8,000) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding them
        different.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (40,000 vs 42,000), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding that 40,000 is less than 42,000.

      result: 'YES'
    5f7087a0-ac0c-4555-9833-c88c1ccadbd1:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the populations
        are roughly equal" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. While it mentions possible slight variations ("some sources vary and
        could make one slightly higher or lower"), it bases its conclusion on them
        being "very close" and "roughly equal"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (NOT less populous than)

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the populations are "approximately
        equal" and this equality is the basis for the NO answer. The model notes they
        are "around 45,000" for both locations, with only a mention that "sources
        may vary slightly" but not stating an actual difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (100,000
        vs 29,369) and indicates they are not equal by using the ">" symbol. The NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (100,000 > 29,369)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Bonao (being a city) would likely
        have a larger population than Bhagawangola II (being a community development
        block). The NO answer appears inconsistent with its reasoning, but we must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated without trying to resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly gives different population values (160,000 vs 250,000).
        The NO answer appears to be because Bhagawangola II is actually larger than
        Bonao, contrary to the initial hypothesis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 5, and this is given as a direct comparative result after evaluating
        population figures.

        equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Bonao (a city) likely has a larger
        population than Bhagawangola II (a community development block). The NO answer
        was based on this expected difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Bonao is not less populous than Bhagawangola II. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Bonao's population
        is significantly larger than that of Bhagawangola II" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality, as the
        basis for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after going through its reasoning steps and concluding that Bonao's
        population is significantly larger than Bhagawangola II's.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Bonao has a significantly larger
        population than Bhagawangola II." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that Bonao has a significantly larger population than Bhagawangola
        II. This is a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it reasons through the likely sizes based on the
        type of settlements (city vs rural block) and arrives at NO, suggesting there
        is a difference rather than equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that Grecia (75,000) likely
        has a larger population than Wadi al Hayaa District (which it estimated would
        be smaller based on Libya's total population). The NO was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating this as its final comparative answer. While the
        reasoning shows uncertainty about one population, it still provided a clear
        NO answer.

    75cb98a2-aa48-4e91-bdd4-514b3533b72d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated that Wadi al Hayaa District likely
        has a smaller population than Grecia, citing factors like district size and
        population density. The NO answer was based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Wadi al Hayaa District does not have a
        larger population than Grecia. While the model acknowledged uncertainty about
        exact numbers, it still provided a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it suggests that Wadi al Hayaa District's population is likely
        smaller than Grecia's 76,000, saying it is "highly improbable that a district
        would have a population exceeding 76,000." The NO answer is based on an implied
        difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.

    bbd6bb40-3faf-4a91-8130-0de2980ead14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Grecia "likely has a larger population
        than Wadi al Hayaa District" and described Wadi al Hayaa as "relatively sparsely
        populated" with population "far less than 76,000". The NO answer was based
        on this difference in populations, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, indicating that Wadi al Hayaa District does not have a larger
        population than Grecia. This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (76,000 > ~30,000) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The inequality between the values is clearly
        stated with the ">" symbol.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Grecia has a "significantly
        larger population" than Wadi al Hayaa District, indicating a clear difference
        in values rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Grecia's population
        (76,000) appears to be greater than Wadi al Hayaa District's population, indicating
        a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Grecia's population is greater than Wadi
        al Hayaa District's population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Grecia has around 80,000 people while Wadi
        al Hayaa District likely has a smaller population, though exact figures weren't
        available. The NO answer was based on this difference in population, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Wadi al
        Hayaa District does not have a larger population than Grecia.

    fe27a96d-037d-4c2e-86f4-ae0f41ba3666:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Wadi al Hayaa District has a lower population,
        describing it as "sparsely populated" and "extremely unlikely to have a population
        exceeding 76,000" compared to Grecia's 76,000. The NO answer was based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations. This
        was a clear NO answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        (over 1.6 million for the district) compared to Washington County (around
        20,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Puducode is NOT less populous than Washington County, Nebraska.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly reasoned that Upper
        Normandy must be MORE populous than Samar (since it was part of Normandy,
        which is stated to be larger than Samar). The NO answer was based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear directional conclusion that Upper Normandy
        is not less populous than Samar.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Upper Normandy's population
        would be significantly larger than Samar's (even at half of combined Normandy's
        3 million vs Samar's 800,000), indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both regions,
        indicating Upper Normandy does not have less population than Samar.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated Upper Normandy would be larger than Samar's
        population ("it would still be larger than Samar's population"). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after walking through population estimates for both regions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that 1.85 million is greater than 793,000. The
        NO answer was based on finding a difference between the values, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, making a clear comparative statement. While the data points
        are from different years, the model still provided a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states Upper Normandy would have more people than
        Samar, even if using a conservative estimate ("Even if Upper Normandy had
        half the population of the current Normandy region, it would still have more
        people than Samar")

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Upper Normandy's
        population was "slightly larger than Samar's" (indicating a difference, not
        equality), and provides specific different values (1.8 million vs 1.7 million).
        Therefore, the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the populations were equal - it actually suggested one
        was likely larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "likely NO" which indicates
        uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative answer. The model explicitly
        states it "can't definitively answer this question" and makes assumptions
        based on "general knowledge." This level of uncertainty means it's not providing
        a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it explicitly noted that Normandy has a larger population (over 3
        million) than Samar (less than 2 million). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations of Normandy and Samar. While it noted issues with comparing
        Upper Normandy specifically, it proceeded to make a clear comparison using
        current Normandy data and gave a definitive NO answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly noted differences in populations, concluding that
        Upper Normandy must have had a smaller population than Samar. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.

      result: 'YES'
    4b5f458b-3fc7-4545-aee1-a313aa0dc663:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal - instead, it concluded NO because it determined that Crest, California
        likely has a larger population than RAF Cranwell. The model explicitly noted
        a difference ("larger population than") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5cefe5b9-69df-4802-8f1d-67e070de1e02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of the two locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9b3605d4-60ea-4c12-b1c7-95e6ad4089eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it reasoned that Crest is "likely to have a larger population
        than Cranwell" and concluded NO based on this difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Crest is NOT less populous than Cranwell.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d97b3e3f-5ebd-42a7-be95-833f617f97c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Crest, CA (2,500) is less populous than
        Cranwell (3,500-4,000)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ee40db60-b960-43a0-8a3d-fbfcd4960270:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (2,700 vs 3,700), not equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Crest, CA (2,700) is less populous than
        Cranwell (3,700)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ff32a72f-0953-432c-94b8-74aae53b2d82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location (Crest) is likely MORE populous than the other (Cranwell), not because
        they have equal populations. The model explicitly states it believes there
        is a difference in population sizes, with the town having a larger population
        than the military base.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "So the answer
        to the original question is NO" after determining that Crest, CA is likely
        MORE populous than Cranwell, not less populous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
