    50ee5268-15dd-4386-96c4-6ef70877a067:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually made a final NO comparison, so we don't evaluate whether values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various population estimates
        for both regions but never reaches a definitive conclusion. It keeps revising
        and questioning its own estimates, ending mid-thought about Bihor's population.
        No clear YES/NO answer is provided.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6614e6d0-d189-4593-8f26-87c280b6bc79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Umzinyathi (510,000-550,000) to be less populous
        than Bihor (575,000)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    90f8bf16-e18d-4595-aec7-5b895b83ed1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model was actually
        comparing different values (510k-550k for Umzinyathi vs 575k for Bihor) rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While the model seems to be leaning towards YES throughout its
        reasoning (stating "So the answer is YES" and "So the answer would be YES"),
        since the final statement is incomplete and doesn't actually give a conclusive
        answer, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    944d931d-84d4-46d9-ad70-551a9a6e3c2e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it explores various population estimates and scenarios, it ends mid-thought
        with "Maybe I should look for another approach." The response shows uncertainty
        throughout, comparing different possible numbers without settling on a final
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b1d8dc94-64c8-427e-9e5e-8d7178885801:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" both in
        the thinking section and in the final structured answer, clearly stating that
        Umzinyathi is less populous than Bihor County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b4385364-f6db-4de8-8cf4-1f65b79b2411:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (Umzinyathi ~500k-550k vs Bihor ~575k) rather than equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence with "To determine if Umzinyathi District". However, in the thinking
        process, the model clearly concludes "So yes, Umzinyathi is less populous"
        which directly answers the question of whether Umzinyathi has a smaller population
        than Bihor County.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b82a73c5-8265-4e60-a4eb-03c544371487:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, and provides a clear numerical comparison showing
        Umzinyathi (554,000) is less populous than Bihor (575,000).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c13da398-4ffb-43a1-b383-81fd61038802:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Umzinyathi (538,000)
        has a higher population than Bihor (518,745). The NO answer is given because
        of this difference in values, not because the values are equal. The model
        clearly identifies a population difference of about 20,000 people between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether
        Umzinyathi has a smaller population than Bihor.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2d7262f-12b4-436e-9507-8a47a73f4e83:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did consider scenarios where the values might be similar (around 550k-575k)
        but never reached a final NO conclusion based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a final conclusion. It kept
        going back and forth between different population estimates and scenarios,
        expressing uncertainty throughout. The response ends mid-sentence without
        providing a clear YES/NO answer. The model was attempting to reason through
        the comparison but never arrived at a definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" twice -
        once in the detailed explanation and once as a final standalone answer at
        the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (200 vs 430).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Gladysdale (200 people) is
        less populous than Muenster (430 people).
      final_answer: 'YES'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that "Gladysdale is less populous."
        The answer was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared (211
        vs 430) were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Gladysdale has a smaller population
        than Muenster based on comparing their populations (211 vs 430).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations, indicating Gladysdale has a smaller population
        than Muenster.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Gladysdale having
        a HIGHER population (150-200) than Muenster (118), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states "Gladysdale is more populous" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, with clear step-by-step reasoning leading
        to this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a163545f-f8f7-4d02-a155-f1204ee9d057:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Gladysdale has a larger
        population (200-300 residents) than Muenster (118 residents). The NO answer
        was given because Gladysdale was determined to be MORE populous, not because
        the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result, stating that Gladysdale has a larger population
        than Muenster. The answer was definitive and not qualified with uncertainty
        statements that would make it UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ea4bbb0d-af3e-40f7-986e-da78dc67d8bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "YES, Gladysdale is less populous than Muenster."
        The model arrived at specific population numbers (180 for Gladysdale and 275
        for Muenster) and made a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f21ee54f-68a6-4715-a66b-e8e41e00a9dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gladysdale (264)
        is MORE populous than Muenster (118), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because Gladysdale is larger, not because the populations
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing specific population numbers
        to support its conclusion that Gladysdale (264 people) is more populous than
        Muenster (118 people).

        is irrelevant since the final classification wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. The model oscillates between YES and NO depending
        on different population estimates it considers, and ends mid-thought without
        making a definitive conclusion. The last complete comparison suggests "if

        the populations, stating that Caseyville (3,901) exceeds Samaipata's town
        estimate (~3,500). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (4,245 vs 3,819), it does not state that these numbers are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly uses these different values to conclude that Caseyville is MORE
        populous than Samaipata, not that they are equal. The NO answer is based on
        Caseyville being larger, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by population numbers supporting its answer.
        The model is making a direct comparative statement that Caseyville is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population values
        (7,663 for Corning vs ~5,000 for Toton), it does not state these values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Corning's population (~7,663) exceeds
        Toton's (~5,000)" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Corning
        being more populous, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Corning (~8,000) has a "slightly higher
        population than Toton (~7,500-7,600)". The NO answer is based on Corning being
        larger than Toton, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Corning, California,
        is not less populous than Toton" as its final answer after comparing the populations.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly oscillates
        between YES and NO depending on different population scenarios it considers,
        but never commits to a final answer. The last complete thought suggests both
        possibilities ("Hence, the answer would be YES" followed by "But if the village
        of Toton is only part of the ward and has, say, 5,000 people, then the answer
        is NO")

      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain throughout its reasoning,
        its final NO answer was based on a clear difference in populations (Corning
        at 8,000 vs Toton at 6,000), not because the values were equal. The model
        explicitly states the difference in population as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population estimates (Corning ~8,000, Toton ~6,000) and
        explicitly concluding that since Corning has more residents, the answer is
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar
        (Corning ~7,663 vs Toton ~7,000), it consistently states Corning is "slightly
        more populous" than Toton. The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on the values being equal. The model never explicitly states the populations
        are exactly the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Corning is not less
        populous than" (though cut off). Throughout the response, it arrives at NO
        multiple times when comparing estimated populations (Corning ~7,663 vs Toton
        ~7,000), and the final reasoning sequence leads to this NO answer.

        (suggesting both YES and NO at different points), it doesn't reach a definitive
        conclusion. The last comparison suggests Richland Center at 5,114 vs Looe

        of whether the values are equal is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response goes through many iterations of thinking
        but never actually provides an explicit final YES/NO answer. While it ends
        with comparing populations (Richland Center at 5,100 vs Looe at 4,300), it
        doesn't state a conclusive answer to whether Richland Center has a smaller

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering different
        scenarios and alternatives, discussing various population estimates, but gets
        cut off mid-thought without making a definitive conclusion. While it mentions
        "NO" a few times while reasoning through scenarios, these are hypothetical

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ragusa
        (320,000) is MORE populous than Morrelganj (218,000), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in populations, with
        Ragusa being larger.

        has a higher population than Morrelganj (under 200,000), and this difference
        in values was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population estimates (320,000 for Ragusa vs under 200,000
        for Morrelganj) and explicitly concluding that since Ragusa's population is
        higher, the answer is "NO" to whether it is less populous.

        states NO because Ragusa's population (321,000) is greater than Morrelganj's
        (152,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that since 321,000 is greater than 152,000, Ragusa is more populous,

        the criteria, regardless of any population comparisons discussed in the text.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO answer. While the model seems to be leaning
        towards concluding that Mosina (13,000) is more populous than Camp Verde (12,000),
        it never explicitly states a final comparative answer before cutting off.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        it was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Mosina (~13,000) has a "slightly higher population than Camp Verde (~12,500)"
        - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after the step-by-step analysis, providing specific population numbers and
        a direct comparison showing Mosina (~13,000) has a higher population than
        Camp Verde (~12,500).

      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was given because the model concluded
        Mosina is MORE populous than Camp Verde (13,500 vs 12,147), not because they
        are equal. The model consistently describes different values for the two populations,
        never stating they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows significant uncertainty and back-and-forth
        reasoning, but ultimately concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO" based
        on comparing estimated populations (Mosina ~13,500 vs Camp Verde ~12,147).
        While there is some hedging after this ("But if Camp Verde's population is
        higher, then YES"), the last definitive comparative statement gives NO as
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Mosina (13,000)
        is MORE populous than Camp Verde (12,147). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality. The model consistently maintains
        that Mosina has a higher population, making it not less populous than Camp
        Verde.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" multiple times
        in the final paragraphs, stating that Mosina is not less populous than Camp
        Verde because Mosina's population (around 13,000) is higher than Camp Verde's
        (12,147). While there is some uncertainty and alternative scenarios discussed
        throughout, the model ultimately commits to a "NO" answer based on these population
        figures.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the tentative "NO" mentioned in the text, it was based on Mosina being more
        populous (13.8k vs 10.5k), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model seems
        to be leaning towards NO at points, it continues to second-guess itself and
        express uncertainty about the numbers. Without a clear final answer, this
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mosina's
        population (14,460) is larger than Camp Verde's (12,098). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since
        Mosina's population (14,460) exceeds Camp Verde's (12,098), the answer is

        did discuss scenarios where the populations might be similar, but never reached
        a final NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers various scenarios (e.g.,
        "if Mosina is 13k and Camp Verde is 12k, then NO"), it keeps presenting alternatives
        and questioning its own numbers. The response ends mid-sentence without making

        vs 12,147). The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explaining that since Mosina's population

        notes this difference in values, even though it's relatively small.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cork (581,231) has a "marginally
        higher" population than Taranto (575,000-580,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.

        is slightly higher than Taranto (574,000), not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states the difference in values ("Cork's population is slightly
        higher") as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Cork's population (581,000) is higher than
        Taranto's (574,000). The answer was definitively stated twice at the end.

        than Barrie's. The NO answer is based on Calama being more populous by about
        57 people, not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are very close (147,886 vs 147,829),
        the model explicitly states that "Calama's population is slightly higher"
        and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though the difference is tiny, any stated difference means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Calama is not less populous than
        Barrie because Calama's population is slightly higher (147,886 vs 147,829).

        (147,886 vs 147,829), it explicitly states that Calama is "slightly more populous"
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because they
        are equal. The model consistently maintains that Calama has a slightly higher
        population, even if by only 57 people. Since the NO answer is based on Calama
        being larger, not on the values being equal, this should be classified as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes multiple times that based
        on the latest official census data (Calama: 147,886 in 2017, Barrie: 147,829

        identical," it explicitly states that Calama's figure is "marginally higher"
        (147,886 vs 147,829) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Since it identifies a specific numerical difference, even though tiny, this
        does not qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in bold and supported by its reasoning that Calama (147,886) is actually
        slightly more populous than Barrie (147,829).

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        abruptly without providing a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        scenarios and population figures, it never commits to a final comparative
        conclusion. The closest it comes is saying "Therefore, the answer would be
        YES" but then immediately questions this by considering other scenarios ("But
        wait, if..."). The response ends mid-thought without a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (1,294,722 vs 1,292,042),
        the model explicitly states that Vhembe is "slightly higher" and "more populous
        by about 2,680 people." The NO answer is based on Vhembe being larger than
        Katni, not on them being equal. The model consistently emphasizes this small
        but real difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        on calculated differences in values (1.47M vs 1.44M, etc.), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        doesn't reach a final explicit conclusion. While there are several intermediate
        "NO" statements throughout the analysis, the model continues to question its
        calculations and assumptions afterward, showing uncertainty. Without a clear

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        final YES/NO conclusion about the population comparison. While it provides
        some population ranges for both locations, it does not complete the comparison
        or state a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Quetzaltenango
        (799k) was MORE populous than Khuzdar (593k). The model never stated the values
        were the same - it explicitly noted a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Quetzaltenango Department (799k) has
        a higher population than Khuzdar District (593k). While the model showed uncertainty
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately gave a clear NO answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Tando Muhammad Khan
        (677,228) has a higher population than Pathankot (626,154). The NO answer
        was given because one value was larger than the other, not because they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing
        Tando Muhammad Khan (677k) is more populous than Pathankot (626k). This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the last complete comparison (500 vs 499), it noted a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        and at times leans towards NO, it continues to alternate between different
        scenarios and express uncertainty without settling on a definitive answer.
        The last complete thought suggests NO (comparing 500 vs 499) but then continues
        with "Alternatively," before being cut off.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Coral Bay (500-700)
        is MORE populous than Attunga (324), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative explanation, stating that Coral Bay (500-700 people) is
        more populous than Attunga (324 people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Coral Bay having
        a larger population (810) than Attunga (399), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in population sizes, with
        Coral Bay being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Coral Bay (810) has a larger population than
        Attunga (~400). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        both locations (600-700 vs 300-400), it does not state they are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states that Coral Bay's population exceeds Attunga's,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "ANSWER: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Coral
        Bay (634) is MORE populous than Attunga (363), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states "634 > 363" and "Coral Bay is more populous

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion, so the question of whether values were equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through trying to determine Hardin
        County's population but never reaches a conclusion about Zenica's population
        or makes an explicit comparative statement with a YES/NO answer. The response
        ends without making the requested comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        population values (111,000 vs 73,000) and explicitly states that Hardin County
        is more populous than Zenica. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Hardin County (111,000) is more populous than
        Zenica (73,000), making it a definitive comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the municipality populations
        are similar (both around 110k), it ultimately bases its NO answer on comparing
        Hardin County (110k) to Zenica city proper (70k), finding that Hardin County
        is more populous. The NO answer is based on this population difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Hardin County

        municipality populations might be similar ("if the municipality has around
        110k, then it would be similar to Hardin County"), its final NO answer is
        based on a clear difference in values (110,000 vs 70,000), not on equality.
        The model explicitly states that one population exceeds the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers (110,000 vs 70,000) and explicitly concluding
        that since Hardin County's population exceeds Zenica's, the answer is "NO".

        values (110,700 vs 73,751) and explicitly stating that Hardin County is MORE
        populous than Zenica. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and
        inequality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Hardin County (110,700)
        is more populous than Zenica (73,751).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are

        with David having 90,000-150,000 people and Botafogo having 50,000-80,000
        people. The NO answer is based on David having a larger population than Botafogo,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final summary. The

        values (82k vs 50k, 82k vs 80k), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. While "NO" appears multiple times in the reasoning,
        the response ends with "Let me check" and earlier states "I need to be sure."

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that David has a population of "82,000-100,000"
        while Botafogo has "approximately 80,000". The NO answer is based on David
        being "slightly higher" in population, not on the values being equal. Even
        though the difference might be small, the model explicitly notes a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        because David is more populous, not because the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        different possible population values and arrives at NO because it believes
        David (82k-150k) is more populous than Botafogo (estimated around 50k-83k).
        The NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather on David
        being larger. Even when discussing similar numbers (82k vs 83k), it notes
        differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" in its final paragraph, making a clear comparative statement based on
        its reasoning that David, being a city, is likely more populous than Botafogo,
        a neighborhood.

        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear YES/NO answer. While it discusses various population estimates and possibilities,
        it keeps alternating between different scenarios without reaching a definitive
        conclusion. The response appears to be an ongoing thought process that was
        cut off before making a final determination.

        discussion of similar populations (12k vs 13k) is irrelevant since no final
        NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing an
        explicit final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various scenarios
        and seems to lean towards NO when comparing Qabala to Ziro, India, it also
        introduces uncertainty about which Ziro is being referenced and ends without
        making a definitive statement.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Qabala has a "slightly higher
        population" (13,300 vs 12,689) and this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer. Even when considering potential growth in Ziro's population, the model

        but since it never reached a final NO answer, those discussions are not relevant
        to this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model goes back and forth between different
        possibilities but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it considers
        various scenarios and calculations, it doesn't make a definitive comparative
        statement about which place is more populous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the populations (12,000 vs
        10,000) and finds them to be similar, it explicitly states there is a difference
        with Blandford Forum being more populous. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Blandford Forum (12,000) has a higher population
        than Siano (10,000). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both populations are around
        10k, it explicitly states there is a difference in the numbers (Blandford
        at 10,355 vs Siano at 10,136) and uses this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not their equality. The model specifically says "Blandford Forum
        has a slightly higher population than Siano" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion and in the detailed explanation. This NO is given as
        a direct comparative result (Blandford is not less populous than Siano), not
        as an inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (10,355 vs 9,997), the
        model explicitly notes a difference and bases its NO answer on Blandford being
        larger than Siano ("Blandford Forum's population exceeds Siano's"), not on
        them being equal. The model consistently maintains throughout that Blandford
        has a slightly higher population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Blandford Forum
        having about 12,000 people while Siano (whether Italian or Polish) has a smaller
        population (either 3,000-5,000 or 6,500). The NO answer is based on Blandford
        being larger, not on equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Blandford Forum is more populous
        than Siano." This is a direct NO answer to whether Blandford Forum is less
        populous than Siano.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses similar populations at points
        during its reasoning (both around 10,000), its final NO answer is based on
        a clear difference in values (Blandford Forum at 12,000 vs Siano at 10,000).
        The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer, but rather
        states that Blandford is "more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Blandford
        Forum (12,000) is more populous than Siano (10,000).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses similar population numbers
        in its analysis (1.58M vs 1.57M), it explicitly states that Nizamabad remains
        "slightly more populous" than Kalahandi. The NO answer is based on this small
        difference, not on equality. The model consistently maintains that Nizamabad
        has a higher population, whether considering pre-split or post-split figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer that "Nizamabad district is not less
        populous than Kalahandi district." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Nizamabad's population
        (2,552,073) is higher than Kalahandi's (1,573,054), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations (2,552,073 vs 1,573,054) and finding that Nizamabad's population
        is higher than Kalahandi's. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Nizamabad having
        a larger population (2.5M) than Kalahandi (1.5M), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states the populations are different and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning, based on comparing the 2011 census populations where
        Nizamabad (2,552,073) was more populous than Kalahandi (1,576,869). While
        the model discusses complications with the district split, it ultimately commits
        to a "NO" answer based on the available 2011 data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Enugu State (4.4-5 million)
        is MORE populous than Barabanki district (3.7-3.8 million). The NO answer
        is given because there is a difference in values, with Enugu being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with "**Answer:** NO." The model provides a clear comparative result,
        stating that Enugu State is more populous than Barabanki district.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c07df764-8f7d-4a62-9dc2-270a67e40b8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations, with Enugu State having approximately 4.4 million people and
        Barabanki district having approximately 3.8 million people. The NO is given
        because Enugu is MORE populous, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Enugu State (4.4M) is more
        populous than Barabanki district (3.8M). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec2a60ad-8c77-4e5b-9fe7-9edd2c75cc73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does extensive calculations and comparisons,
        it concludes that Enugu State (~4.4-5 million) is actually larger than Barabanki
        District (~3.8-4.1 million). The NO answer is given because there's a difference
        in values (Enugu being more populous), not because the values are equal. Therefore,
        this does not meet our criteria for a "same values" NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating
        Enugu State is NOT less populous than Barabanki district). The answer is definitive
        and matches our criteria for a NO classification.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (Enugu State at ~4.4
        million and Barabanki at ~3.8 million) and states that "Enugu State is more
        populous than Barabanki district." The NO answer is given because Enugu is
        larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Enugu State is NOT less populous than Barabanki district.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of any equality comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. It keeps oscillating between YES and NO depending
        on different population scenarios, and ends mid-thought with "The answer could
        depend". Without a definitive conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (1,846 vs 1,831),
        the model explicitly states that "Balcombe is slightly more populous" and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim
        the populations are equal/same/identical, but rather notes a small but definite
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: NO"
        and clearly stated that Balcombe is not less populous than Moweaqua, providing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Balcombe (1,846)
        is "slightly higher" than Moweaqua (1,831). The NO answer is based on this
        small difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that Balcombe
        is not less populous than Moweaqua because Balcombe's population (1,846) is
        slightly higher than Moweaqua's (1,831).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        it as a clear final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal
        answer section with explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        (1,833 vs 1,798), it explicitly states that Balcombe is "slightly higher"
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not their equality.
        Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not
        equal, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        concludes that Balcombe is not less populous than Moweaqua, providing specific
        population numbers to support this conclusion.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values in the thinking process.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final answer. While there is discussion of various population figures
        and a tentative "YES" in the thinking process, the actual response cuts off
        before stating a definitive conclusion. Therefore, we cannot determine the
        model's final answer.

        the incomplete response never reached a point of comparing final values or
        stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off or corrupted, mixing
        in unrelated content about physics problems. The model started comparing populations

        The NO is because Bramhope is more populous, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and explaining that since
        Bramhope's population (3,634) exceeds Tomahawk's (3,346), the answer is "NO"

        (13,579) has a higher population than Little Hulton (12,271). The NO answer
        was given because Shuanghu is MORE populous, not because the populations are

        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even in the
        portions where the model considered answering NO, it was because one location
        had a higher population than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes back and forth multiple times, considering
        different population estimates and scenarios. It starts leaning towards NO
        when thinking Shuanghu has 14k people, but then finds 2020 data showing 11,367
        for Shuanghu vs 12,271 for Little Hulton. The response ends mid-thought without
        providing a final explicit YES/NO answer. Due to the lack of a clear final

        concludes NO because Shuanghu (14,000) is actually MORE populous than Little
        Hulton (12,343), not because they are equal. The model explicitly states "Shuanghu
        County's population is slightly higher" as the reason for its NO answer.

        of the time trying to determine which place had a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive answer. It repeatedly oscillates between different
        possibilities, considering scenarios where Shuanghu County could be more or
        less populous than Little Hulton. While it mentions "therefore, the answer
        would be NO" at points, it immediately questions these conclusions and continues

        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly

        NO at various points, those were based on Shuanghu having a larger population
        (around 14,000 vs 12,500), not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various population figures
        and seems to lean towards NO at several points, it keeps introducing alternatives
        and doubts, and never reaches a definitive conclusion before cutting off.
        Therefore, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" in its final reasoning,
        stating that since Shuanghu County (13,664) has more people than Little Hulton
        (12,000), it is not less populous. While there is some uncertainty expressed

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    b86194ca-2f5d-4502-82f0-09b8b759fb58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        the populations are different (2,867 vs 363), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states that "Crest is more populous than Cranwell" as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Crest is more populous." The answer directly
        addresses the comparison of populations with specific numbers.
