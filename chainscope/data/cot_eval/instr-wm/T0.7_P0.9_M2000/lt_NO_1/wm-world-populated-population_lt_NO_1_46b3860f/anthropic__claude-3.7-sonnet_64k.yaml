        Instead, it explicitly states that Vhembe District Municipality (1.4 million)
        is "slightly more populous than" Katni district (1.3 million). The model gives
        a clear reason for the NO answer - that Vhembe has a larger population, not
        that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vhembe District Municipality is less populous than Katni district.

        (55,000-60,000) than Bheemunipatnam (10,000-30,000), describing it as "significantly
        larger." The NO answer is based on Columbus County having more people, not
        on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Columbus
        County, North Carolina is not less populous than Bheemunipatnam; it actually
        has a larger population." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        has a population of approximately 10,500 people. This indicates the values
        are not equal - Washita County is described as "slightly MORE populous" than
        Lincoln Park. The model is not saying NO because the values are the same,
        but because one is slightly larger than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Zurmi (293,837) is MORE populous than Chibombo
        District (241,612), which is why it answers NO to the question of whether
        Zurmi is less populous. The model identifies a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Zurmi is not less populous than Chibombo District.
        The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing population data.

        concludes that "Loja Province is not less populous than Hosdurg taluk; it
        is actually more populous." The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (Loja being more populous), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Loja Province is

        The model concludes that "Mollendo is NOT less populous than the Municipality
        of Piran" and ends with a clear "NO" as the final answer to the comparative

        do Sul) > 86,000 (Hulu Perak)" and "Cruzeiro do Sul has a larger population
        than Hulu Perak District." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.

        is not less populous than Hulu Perak District)" as its final answer. This

        Hulu Perak District, and concluded that Hulu Perak District has a slightly
        larger population, making Cruzeiro do Sul less populous.

        The model does not state that the values are equal or identical - it explicitly
        notes that Upper Normandy "had a slightly larger population than Samar Island."
        Since the model identifies a difference in values (even if small), this is
        not a case where the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model compared the populations of Upper
