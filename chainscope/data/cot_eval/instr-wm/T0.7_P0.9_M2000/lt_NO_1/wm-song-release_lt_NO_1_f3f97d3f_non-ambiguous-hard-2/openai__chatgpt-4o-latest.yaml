        was released in December 1982 while "Round and Around" was released in September
        1987. The model's reasoning is that 1982 is earlier than 1987, meaning the

        released earlier than Gavin DeGraw's song. The model explicitly states "A-ha's

        (2013). The NO answer was given because the model found that the premise of

        Body" was released in 2010 while "Dhadkane Azad Hain" was released in 2017,

        it determined that "Tribal Dance" was released in 1993 while "So Many Ways"
        was released in 1996, and therefore "Tribal Dance" was released before "So
        Many Ways" - the opposite of what was asked in the question.

        (2015 vs 2000) and states that "Hunter Hayes's '21' was released after Saliva's
        'Your Disease'". The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about
        whether one song was released before the other, not because the values are

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Your Disease" was released in 2000 while "21" was released in 2015,
        and since 2000 is earlier than 2015, "21" was NOT released earlier than "Your
        Disease". The model is noting a difference in values (2000 vs 2015), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concluded that "Your Disease" by Saliva was released earlier than
        "21" by Hunter Hayes, which means it's answering "NO" to the question of whether
        "21" was released earlier.

        The NO answer was given because the comparison direction didn't hold (the
        first song was released later, not earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        was released 15 years earlier than "21" (2015), indicating a clear difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise that Hunter Hayes's
        "21" was released earlier than Saliva's "Your Disease" (it was actually the
        opposite).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release dates) were different, not because they were
        the same. Specifically, it determined that Jack Ingram's song was released
        in 2005 while Lana Del Rey's song was released in 2014, and since 2005 is
        earlier than 2014, it answered NO to whether Lana Del Rey's song was released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Jack Ingram's "Wherever You Are" was released in 2005 while Lana Del Rey's
        "Big Eyes" was released in 2014, and concluded with a clear "NO" answer to

        that the premise was incorrect - Jack Ingram's song was released in 2005 while
        Lana Del Rey's song was released in 2014, meaning Jack Ingram's song came
        out earlier, not Lana Del Rey's as the question suggested. The model identified

        Lars Vaular's "Kem kan eg ringe" (2011), which means it's answering "NO" to
        the question of whether Lars Vaular's song was released earlier.

        that the release dates were different (1999 vs. 2010), with "Hello Time Bomb"
        being released earlier than "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)". The model explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2001) and concludes that "1997 is earlier than
        2001." The NO answer is given because Gina G's song was released earlier (1997)
        than BoA's song (2001), not because they were released at the same time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release

        in 1997 while BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was released in 2001, and concludes that
        since 1997 is earlier than 2001, Gina G's song was released earlier. The NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release

        at different times - Gina G's "Ti Amo" in May 1997 and BoA's "Amazing Kiss"
        on May 30, 2001. The NO answer is based on the fact that Gina G's song was
        released earlier (1997 is earlier than 2001), not because the release dates
        are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates were different (1997 vs 2001), with Gina G's song being
        released earlier than BoA's song, which is the opposite of what the question
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Gina G's "Ti Amo" was released in 1997 while BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was released
        in 2001, and concluded that since the question asked if BoA's song was released
        earlier, the answer is "NO".

        is earlier than 2001, Gina G's 'Ti Amo' was released earlier." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
