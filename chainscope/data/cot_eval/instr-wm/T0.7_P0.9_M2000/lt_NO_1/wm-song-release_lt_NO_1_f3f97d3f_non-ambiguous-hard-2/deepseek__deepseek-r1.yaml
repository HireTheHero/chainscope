        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown"
        was released in March 2009 while Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was released
        in December 2009. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that March 2009
        precedes December 2009, not that the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was released earlier

        times (2016 vs 2006) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model indicates that Mike Posner's song was released later (in 2016) than
        Alesha Dixon's song (in 2006).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was released earlier
        than Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown". The model provides specific dates (2016 vs

        was released in 2006 while Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was released in
        2010, and concludes that "Since 2006 precedes 2010, 'Knockdown' was released
        earlier." The model is giving NO because one release date is earlier than
        the other, not because they're the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reiterates "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The model clearly

        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer to the comparative question. The model spends the entire
        response trying to recall if "Round and Around" is a Pink Floyd song, but
        never reaches a conclusion about the comparison of release dates between the
        two songs. The response ends abruptly mid-thought.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The model is trying to determine release dates but
        ends mid-thought without reaching a conclusion. The model considers multiple
        possibilities (1960s vs. 1987 release for Pink Floyd's song) but doesn't commit

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Pink Floyd's song was released
        in 1987 while Divinyls' song was released in 1985, indicating a difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates (with
        Pink Floyd's being later), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pink Floyd's "Round and Around" was released earlier than Divinyls'
        "Science Fiction". The model is making a clear comparative judgment that Pink
        Floyd's song was released later (1987) than Divinyls' song (1985).

        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing a final YES/NO answer to the comparative question. The model spends
        the entire response trying to determine if Pink Floyd's "Round and Around"
        exists and when it might have been released compared to Divinyls' "Science
        Fiction," but never reaches a definitive conclusion or explicitly states YES
        or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model never provided a clear conclusion), the criteria specify that
        the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off before
        providing a final YES/NO answer. The model is working through the problem,
        considering various possibilities about when Pink Floyd's "Round and Around"
        might have been released compared to Divinyls' "Science Fiction," but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. The model seems uncertain about whether "Round
        and Around" is even a real Pink Floyd song and considers multiple scenarios
        without settling on a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years - Divinyls' song in 1983 and Pink Floyd's in 1987. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that Pink Floyd's song came later, not that
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Pink Floyd's "Round and Around"
        was not released earlier than Divinyls's "Science Fiction". The model provides
        specific release dates to support this conclusion.

        was released in 1987 while Divinyls' "Science Fiction" was released in 1985,
        and concludes NO because 1987 is later than 1985. The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values (1987 vs 1985), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Pink Floyd's song (1987) was released later than Divinyls' song (1983),
        not earlier as the question asked. The model identified different years for
        the releases, not equal values.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released in different
        years (2014 vs 1983) and that "1983 precedes 2014," which is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and explains that Pink Floyd's "Round and Around" was released
        in 2014 while Divinyls' "Science Fiction" was released in 1983. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the songs
        were released at different times (1971 vs 1978) and concludes that "Public
        Image" was not released earlier because "1971 precedes 1978".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that "Public Image" was not released earlier than
        "Four Sticks" because "Four Sticks" was released in 1971 while "Public Image"
        was released in 1978.

        than "Four Sticks" because 1971 precedes 1978. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Public Image Ltd's song "Public Image"

        in different years - "Four Sticks" in 1971 and "Public Image" in 1978. The
        NO answer is because "Public Image" was released later than "Four Sticks",
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at both the beginning
        and end of its response. The model is answering "NO" to the question of whether
        Public Image Ltd's song "Public Image" was released earlier than Led Zeppelin's

        to whether Public Image Ltd's song "Public Image" was released earlier than
        Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks". The model explains that "Public Image" was released
        in October 1978, while "Four Sticks" was released in November 1971, and since
        1971 is earlier than 1978, the answer is NO.

        in different years - "Four Sticks" in 1971 and "Public Image" in 1978. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that Led Zeppelin's song was released
        7 years earlier than Public Image Ltd's song, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years - "Public Image" in 1978 and "Four Sticks" in 1971. The
        NO answer is given because Led Zeppelin's song was released earlier (1971)
        than Public Image Ltd's song (1978), not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in release dates (2013/2014
        vs. 2018) and states that Diplo's song was released earlier than Charli XCX's
        song. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and it's clearly making a comparative judgment about which song was released
        first. The model concludes that "Diplo's involvement in 'Elastic Heart' (2013/2014)

        different release dates (2018 vs 2014), not on the values being equal. The
        model explicitly states that "Diplo's version (2014) predates Charli XCX's
        involvement in 'Girls' (2018)" and concludes that "Diplo's 'Elastic Heart'
        was released earlier." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Charli XCX's song "Girls" was released earlier than

        the two songs were released at different times (2013 vs 2018), not because
        they were released at the same time. The model clearly states that Diplo's
        involvement with "Elastic Heart" occurred earlier (in 2013) than Charli XCX's
        "Girls" (in 2018).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        is clearly indicating a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "NO, Charli XCX's
        'Girls' was released later than Diplo's involvement in 'Elastic Heart.'" The

        years (2013 vs 2018), and the NO answer is because Diplo's song came out earlier
        (2013) than Charli XCX's song (2018). The model is noting a clear difference
        in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is directly answering the comparative question about whether Charli

        at different times - "Girls" in 2018 and "Elastic Heart" in 2013. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that "Girls" came later than "Elastic Heart"
        (2018 comes after 2013), not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        comparison where one release date precedes the other, not stating they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this in its explanation, stating "the answer
        is NO" because George Ezra's song was released in 2014 and Kanye West's song
        was either released later or doesn't exist.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the songs were released
        in different years - "Water" in 2019 and "Cassy O'" in 2014. The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that 2014 precedes 2019, not because the release
        dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Kanye West's "Water" was not released
        earlier than George Ezra's "Cassy O'". The model provides specific release
        dates and explains its reasoning.

        response trying to recall information about Kanye West's song "Water" and
        George Ezra's "Cassy O'" but never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response
        ends abruptly while still searching for information.

        times (2007 vs 2013), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model states that "Since 2007 precedes 2013, 'Live for the Night' was
        not released earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Krewella's "Live
        for the Night" was not released earlier than Type O Negative's "September
        Sun" because the former was released in 2013 while the latter was released

        song released in 2013. The model explicitly states "2007 (Type O Negative)
        is earlier than 2013 (Krewella)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Type O Negative's song was released in 2007 while Krewella's song was released
        in 2013, and concluded that Krewella's song was not released earlier.

        song. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model concludes that
        Tanya Tucker's song was released in 1974, which is later than The Beatles'
        song released in 1965, so the answer to whether Tucker's song was released
        earlier is "NO".

        The model was leaning toward "NO" in its reasoning (suggesting Shreya Ghoshal's
        song was likely from 2013 or later, which would be after Nelly's 2010 song),
        but it repeatedly expressed uncertainty and never provided a final answer.

        released earlier than Ne-Yo's song. The model explicitly states "Since 1999
        precedes 2008, 911's song came out earlier."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Ne-Yo's "Forever Now" was NOT released earlier than

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Katerine
        Duska's "Better Love" was NOT released earlier than Birdman's "Leather So

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Slade's song was released in
        1981 and Naughty by Nature's song was released in 1991, with Slade's song
        coming out 10 years before Naughty by Nature's. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Naughty by Nature's "Uptown Anthem" was not released
        earlier than Slade's "We'll Bring the House Down" because Slade's song came
        out in 1981 while Naughty by Nature's song came out in 1991.

        earlier (1979) than David Ogden Stiers's song (1991).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "Something There was not released

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Pink Floyd's song was released in 1979 while Stiers's song was released
        in 1991, making Pink Floyd's song earlier. The model explicitly states "1979
        precedes 1991" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Pink Floyd's
        song was released earlier (1979) than David Ogden Stiers's song (1991), so
        the answer to whether Stiers's song was released earlier is "NO".

        vs. 1979) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        concludes that Pink Floyd's song was released earlier (1979) than Stiers's
        song (1991), which is why it answers NO to whether Stiers's song was released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive
        "NO" at the beginning of its response and reaffirms this in Step 3 with "Since

        being released earlier than David Ogden Stiers's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Pink Floyd's song was released in 1979 while David Ogden Stiers's song was
        released in 1991, concluding that David Ogden Stiers's song was NOT released
        earlier.

        that Jack Ingram's song was released in 2005 while Lana Del Rey's song was
        released in 2014, making Jack Ingram's song earlier. The model explicitly
        states "Since 2005 (Ingram's release) precedes 2014 (Del Rey's), 'Wherever
        You Are' came first." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Jack Ingram's
        song was released earlier (2005) than Lana Del Rey's song (2014), and therefore

        songs were released at different times - Ash's "Shining Light" in 2001 and
        Train's "Bruises" in 2012. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, with the model concluding that "Bruises" was released later, not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Train's "Bruises" was released earlier than Ash's "Shining Light."
        The model clearly provides this comparative result, stating "NO. Ash's 'Shining
        Light' was released in 2001, while Train's 'Bruises' came out in 2012. Therefore,
        'Bruises' was not released earlier." The answer is also bolded as "**Answer:**
        NO" at the end.

        years (2008 vs 1999) and concludes that 50 Cent's track was released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Hinder's "Without You" was not
        released earlier than 50 Cent's "Thug Love". The model provides specific dates
        (2008 for Hinder's song and 1999 for 50 Cent's song) and concludes that "50
        Cent's track was released earlier."

        the values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same. It
        specifically states that Prince's song was released in 1992 while Kelly Clarkson's
        song was released in 2007, and concludes that "Since 1992 precedes 2007, 'Sober'
        was not released earlier." The model is clearly indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and explains that Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was not released
        earlier than Prince's "My Name Is Prince" because Prince's song was released
        in 1992 while Clarkson's was released in 2007.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Prince's song was released in
        1995 while Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was released in 2007, and concludes that
        Prince's song was released earlier (by 12 years). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question
        with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the release dates of both songs.

        it explicitly states that the songs were released in different years (2007
        vs 1992) and concludes that "Since 1992 precedes 2007, 'Sober' was not released
        earlier." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was not released earlier
        than Prince's "My Name Is Prince" by stating "NO" and explaining the release
        dates (2007 vs 1992).

        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released
        in different years (1992 vs 2007) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model concludes that Prince's song was released earlier
        (1992) than Kelly Clarkson's song (2007).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was released earlier than Prince's "My

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the values
        are different (2007 vs 1992) and that's why the answer is NO. The model says
        "Since 2007 is later than 1992, the answer is NO," indicating the values are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "NO. Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was released in 2007 as a
        single from her album *My December*. Prince's "My Name Is Prince" was released
        in 1992 as part of his *Love Symbol Album*. Since 2007 is later than 1992,
        the answer is NO." The model also reiterates "**Answer:** NO" at the end.

        "Since 1992 is earlier than 2007, the answer is NO." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values (different years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was not
        released earlier than Prince's "My Name Is Prince." The model provides specific

        at different times (1992 vs 2007) and concludes that Prince's song came out
        first. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and it's making a comparative judgment about the release dates of the two
        songs. The model concludes that Kelly Clarkson's "Sober" was NOT released
        earlier than Prince's "My Name Is Prince" because Prince's song came out in
        1992 while Clarkson's came out in 2007.

        years (1987 vs 2007) and that Prince's song was released earlier than Kelly
        Clarkson's song. The NO answer is based on this difference in release years,
        not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two songs. The model concludes that
        Prince's song was released earlier than Kelly Clarkson's song, not the other
        way around as the question asked.

        Instead, it says NO because the dates are different - Rick Astley's song was
        released in 1991 while Mike Oldfield's song was released in 1983. The model
        explicitly states that "1983 precedes 1991" as the reason for its NO answer,
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rick Astley's "The Ones You Love" was released earlier than Mike
        Oldfield's "In High Places". The model provides specific dates (1991 vs 1983)

        that Gina G's song was released earlier than BoA's song. The NO answer is
        based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial one-word response and in the conclusion
        of its step-by-step explanation. The model determined that Gina G's "Ti Amo"
        (1997) was released before BoA's "Amazing Kiss" (2001), so it answered "NO"
        to the question of whether BoA's song was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    37aab1bf-e6a3-4351-8c53-aead9f2a0ef9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly states that the songs were released
        at different times - "Amazing Kiss" in 2001 and "Ti Amo" in 1997. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and confirms this by explaining that "Amazing Kiss" was not
        released earlier than "Ti Amo" because 1997 is earlier than 2001.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e5cea0b-8310-4871-a9ab-bd9825f77c02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that the songs were released at different times (1997
        vs 2001) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        concludes that "Ti Amo" came out earlier than "Amazing Kiss."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Answer:** NO." after explaining that Gina G's "Ti Amo"
        was released in 1997 while BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was released in 2001, making
        the former earlier than the latter.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4826a8e1-fec4-4e15-90c2-60f274029032:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it found
        that Gina G's song was released in 1997 while BoA's song was released in 2001,
        indicating a clear difference in release dates (with Gina G's being earlier).
        The model explicitly states "Since 1997 (Gina G) is earlier than 2001 (BoA),
        'Ti Amo' predates 'Amazing Kiss'."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model concludes that
        Gina G's "Ti Amo" was released in 1997, which is earlier than BoA's "Amazing
        Kiss" released in 2001, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        BoA's song was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4abfa1a2-ccb7-4604-a43c-388a0ea90747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released in different
        years (1997 vs 2001) and concludes that Gina G's song predates BoA's. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion with "NO, BoA's 'Amazing
        Kiss' was released later than Gina G's 'Ti Amo'." The model is directly answering
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    511b9b74-599f-4cbf-b71d-524e1b77a899:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gina G's song was released in
        1997 while BoA's was released in 2001, making Gina G's song earlier. The model
        is noting a difference in values (different years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Gina G's 'Ti Amo' was
        released earlier." This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        BoA's song was released earlier than Gina G's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98b59fc8-34e5-4818-ab38-8206176eca30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gina G's "Ti Amo" was
        released in 1997 while BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was released on May 30, 2001.
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 1997 precedes 2001, meaning
        the songs were released at different times, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was released earlier than Gina
        G's "Ti Amo". The model provides this answer both in the initial response
        and in the final summary.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the release dates
        (1997 vs 2001) and concludes that Gina G's song was released earlier than
        BoA's song. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model concludes that
        Gina G's "Ti Amo" was released in 1997, which is earlier than BoA's "Amazing
        Kiss" released in 2001, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        BoA's song was released earlier.

    c03b999a-cb40-436d-8ebb-f963b132b2a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gina G's "Ti Amo" (1997)
        predates BoA's "Amazing Kiss" (2001), showing a clear difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly indicates that BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was
        not released earlier than Gina G's "Ti Amo" after comparing their release
        dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4e167eb-58bb-4a00-9206-b1028aa781b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Gina G's "Ti Amo" (July 1997) was released before BoA's "Amazing Kiss" (May
        30, 2001), not because the values are the same. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in release dates (1997 vs 2001).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that BoA's "Amazing Kiss" was not released earlier
        than Gina G's "Ti Amo" because Gina G's song came out in 1997 while BoA's
        was released in 2001.
