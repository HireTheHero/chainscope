      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Science Fiction was released 3 years earlier
        than Round and Around, indicating a difference in values. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based on a temporal
        difference (1974 vs 1983).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model first states in Step 1 that "the two songs
        were released at the same time" (both in 1987), but then contradicts this
        in Step 2 by saying "Pink Floyd's Round and Around was released before Divinyls's
        Science Fiction." The NO answer appears to be based on this claimed temporal
        difference, not on equality. Since the model ultimately claims there is a
        difference in release timing (even after initially saying they were released
        at the same time), this is not a case where equality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment. This is a definitive
        NO answer.'

        at the same time as They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)" and this equality in release
        time is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model explicitly notes
        that both songs were released in 2006 and concludes they were released "at
        the same time," which is the basis for the NO response.
