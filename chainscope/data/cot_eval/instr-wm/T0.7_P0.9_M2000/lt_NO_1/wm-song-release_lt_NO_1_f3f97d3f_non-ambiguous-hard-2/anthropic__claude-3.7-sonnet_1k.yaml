      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the songs were released
        at different times - "Knockdown" in June 2009 and "Looks Like Sex" in December
        2011, with approximately 2.5 years difference. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was not released
        earlier than Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Mike Posner's 'Looks
        Like Sex' was released earlier than Alesha Dixon's 'Knockdown.'" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly states that the songs were released
        at different times - "Knockdown" in 2009 and "Looks Like Sex" in 2011. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that "Looks Like Sex" was released
        later, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was NOT released
        earlier than Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown". This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        at different times - "Knockdown" in 2009 and "Looks Like Sex" in 2011, with
        approximately 2 years difference between them. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        specifically saying "NO (Mike Posner's song was not released earlier than
        Alesha Dixon's)". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly states that Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown"
        (2008) was released approximately 3 years earlier than Mike Posner's "Looks
        Like Sex" (2011). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two songs. This is a clear
        negative answer to the question of whether Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex"
        was released earlier than Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Knockdown" was released in 2009 while "Looks Like Sex" was released
        in 2011, meaning "Knockdown" was released earlier. The model explicitly states
        "2009 (Knockdown) is earlier than 2011 (Looks Like Sex)" as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Mike Posner's Looks Like Sex released earlier than Alesha
        Dixon's Knockdown?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response.

        response, but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that "Pink Floyd does not have a well-known official release titled 'Round
        and Around'". The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the items in the comparison may not exist as described. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Pink Floyd's 'Round
        and Around' was not released earlier than Divinyls's 'Science Fiction'" but
        then explains this is because Pink Floyd doesn't have a song by that title.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it rejected the premise that one of the songs exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,
        explaining that Pink Floyd's "Round and Around" was not released earlier than
        Divinyls's "Science Fiction." However, the model also states this is because
        "Pink Floyd never released a song called 'Round and Around'" and "the question
        is based on a false premise." Since the model is rejecting the premise of
        the question by stating one of the songs doesn't exist, this falls under the

        at different times - "Four Sticks" in 1971 and "Public Image" in 1978. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that 1971 is earlier than 1978, not
        that the dates are the same.

        that Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks" (1971) was released about 7 years before
        Public Image Ltd's "Public Image" (1978), which contradicts what was apparently
        asked in the original question. The model explicitly notes a difference in
        values (7 years difference), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        a 5-year difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model concludes
        that "Elastic Heart" came out in 2013, which is about 5 years before "Girls"
        was released in 2018, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        Charli XCX's "Girls" was released earlier than Diplo's "Elastic Heart."

        at different times - "Summer Days" in 2019 and "Hey Girl" in 2013. The model's
        NO answer is based on the fact that Billy Currington's song was released earlier
        (2013) than Patrick Stump's song (2019), not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Patrick Stump's Summer Days was NOT released earlier

        that Marty Robbins's song was released in 1961 and The Temptations's song
        was released in 1964, meaning The Temptations's song came later, not earlier.
        The model explicitly states "1961 comes before 1964" as the reason for its
        NO answer, indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was The Temptations's I'll Be in Trouble released earlier
        than Marty Robbins's Don't Worry?" The model clearly concludes with "NO" after
        determining that Marty Robbins's song was released in 1961 while The Temptations's
        song was released in 1964.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that one value came after the other (2019 is later than 2007). The model explicitly
        states "2019 (Better Love) is later than 2007 (Leather So Soft)" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Katerine Duska's "Better Love" (2019) was released after Birdman's "Leather
        So Soft" (2007), and therefore concluded with a definitive "NO" to the question

        that "Tribal Dance" (1993) was released BEFORE "So Many Ways" (1996), meaning
        the opposite relationship is true. The model explicitly states the dates are
        different (1993 vs 1996) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is a clear comparative answer to the question of whether
        The Braxtons's "So Many Ways" was released earlier than 2 Unlimited's "Tribal
        Dance". The model also states "Therefore, The Braxtons's 'So Many Ways' was
        NOT released earlier than 2 Unlimited's 'Tribal Dance.'" right before giving
        the final "NO" answer.

        released at different times - "Your Disease" in 2001 and "21" in 2015, with
        approximately 14 years difference between them. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        final answer to whether Hunter Hayes's "21" was released earlier than Saliva's
        "Your Disease." The model provides a direct comparative answer without refusing
        or indicating uncertainty.

        in different years (2017 vs 2012) and concludes NO because 2017 is later than
        2012, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model concludes that
        Sandro Cavazza's "Used To" was not released earlier than Metric's "Youth Without
        Youth" because the former was released in 2017 while the latter was released
        in 2012.

        in different years (Common's in 2000 and Enya's in 1987) and concludes that
        "Enya's 'The Celts' was released earlier than Common's 'Geto Heaven Remix'".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        track was released later, not earlier than Enya's track." The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Enya's song came first (1986
        comes before 2000), not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Common's song was released earlier than Enya's "The Celts". The

        in different years (2004 vs. 2013) and notes they were "approximately 9 years"
        apart. The NO answer is based on the fact that Keith Urban's song came first,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clarifying that "Deftones's 'Swerve City' was not released earlier
        than Keith Urban's 'You're My Better Half'". This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. Instead, it clearly states that the songs were released
        in different years (2012 for Deftones and 2004 for Keith Urban) and concludes
        NO because "2012 (Deftones) is later than 2004 (Keith Urban)." The model is
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Deftones's "Swerve City" was released earlier than Keith Urban's
        "You're My Better Half." The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Deftones's
        'Swerve City' was NOT released earlier than Keith Urban's 'You're My Better
        Half.' NO"
