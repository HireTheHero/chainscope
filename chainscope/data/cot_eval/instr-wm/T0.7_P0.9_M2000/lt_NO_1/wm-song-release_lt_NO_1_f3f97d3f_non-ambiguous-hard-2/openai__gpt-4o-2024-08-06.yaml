      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (December
        2, 2011 vs October 30, 2006) and states that "Alesha Dixon's 'Knockdown' was
        released earlier than Mike Posner's 'Looks Like Sex.'" The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Knockdown" was released
        in 2006, which is earlier than "Looks Like Sex" released in 2011. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 'Looks
        Like Sex' was not released earlier than 'Knockdown.'" This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates were different (2006 vs 2011), with Alesha Dixon's
        song being released earlier. The model explicitly states "Since 2006 is earlier
        than 2011, Alesha Dixon's 'Knockdown' was released earlier than Mike Posner's
        'Looks Like Sex.'"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the question of whether
        Mike Posner's "Looks Like Sex" was released earlier than Alesha Dixon's "Knockdown."
        The model determined that Alesha Dixon's song was released earlier (2006)
        than Mike Posner's song (2011).

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that "Knockdown" was released in 2006
        while "Looks Like Sex" was released in 2011, and concludes that "Looks Like
        Sex" was released after "Knockdown." The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two songs.

        that "Four Sticks" was released in 1971 while "Public Image" was released
        in 1978, meaning the dates are different (with "Four Sticks" being released
        earlier). The model explicitly states "Since 1971 is earlier than 1978, 'Four
        Sticks' was released before 'Public Image.'" This indicates different values,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the songs were released at different times (1965 vs. 1974), with "I'm
        Down" being released earlier. The model explicitly states the difference in
        release dates as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" at the end of its response. The model has determined
        that "I'm Down" was released earlier than "Would You Lay with Me (In a Field

        in different years (1964 vs 1961) and concluded that "Don't Worry" was released
        earlier than "I'll Be in Trouble". The NO answer was given because the comparison
        in the question was reversed from what the model found to be true.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that "When I Find
        Love Again" was released in 2014 while "Bliss" was released in 1999, and since
        1999 is earlier than 2014, the first song was not released earlier than the
        second. The model identified a clear difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO, James
        Blunt's 'When I Find Love Again' was not released earlier than Tori Amos's
        'Bliss'." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Tori Amos was released earlier (1999) than "When I Find Love Again" by James
        Blunt (2014). The model is noting a clear difference in release dates, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two
        songs. The model determined that Tori Amos's "Bliss" was released earlier
        than James Blunt's "When I Find Love Again," which means it's answering NO
        to the question of whether James Blunt's song was released earlier.

        Bomb" was released in 1999 while "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was released in
        2010, and since 1999 is earlier than 2010, the premise of the question (that
        Erykah Badu's song was released before Matthew Good Band's) is false. The
        model identified a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. This is a clear comparative
