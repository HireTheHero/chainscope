        in 1983 and "Round and Around" was released in 1987, concluding that "Science
        Fiction" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release dates, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1983 (Divinyls) is earlier
        than 1987 (Pink Floyd)" - indicating a difference in values (1983 vs 1987)
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model is noting a difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values -
        it actually found the values were different (1979 vs 1983) and answered YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the release dates of the two songs (1979 vs 1983).

        to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually gave a YES answer based
        on finding that one date (2013) was earlier than the other (2018).

        Girls was released in 2017 while Diplo's Elastic Heart was released in 2015,
        making Charli XCX's song released later (not earlier) than Diplo's song. The
        model explicitly states "YES, Charli XCX's Girls was released *later* (not
        earlier) than Diplo's Elastic Heart" which indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.

        In fact, it explicitly notes that the release dates are different (1998 vs

        be in response to a comparative question (likely asking if Ne-Yo's song was

        in 2005 and "Bring On the Rain" was released in 2001, indicating a difference
        in values. The NO answer is based on the fact that the first song was released
        later (2005) than the second song (2001), not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "2001 is earlier than 2012,"
        indicating a clear difference between the release dates. The NO appears to
        be in response to a comparative question (likely asking if Train's "Bruises"
        was released before Ash's "Shining Light").

        concluded with YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

        for "Hello Time Bomb" vs. October 2000 for the soundtrack containing "Turn

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it identifies that "The Ones You Love" was released
        in 1988 and "In High Places" was released in 1987. The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that "The Ones You Love" was released later (1988) than
        "In High Places" (1987), not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also
        states "Therefore, 'The Ones You Love' was NOT released earlier than 'In High
        Places.'" which reinforces the NO answer.
