        release dates were different (2010 vs 2009), not because they were equal.
        The model specifically states that "Mike Posner's song was NOT released earlier
        than Alesha Dixon's song" because "2010 is later than 2009".

        in 2010, which comes after 2009 when "Knockdown" was released. The model is
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient verified information." The model refuses
        to make a comparison because it lacks the necessary information about release
        dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the information needed to make
        the comparison, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" response. However, this
        "NO" is given as a default because the model "cannot verify the dates" and
        has "insufficient evidence to support a YES," which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot
        verify" or "NO, I cannot determine."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. The model determined that Pink Floyd's song was released in
        1994 while Divinyls' song was released in 1998, finding a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question
        about which song was released earlier.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Divinyls song was released in 1988
        while the Pink Floyd song was released in 1994, and concludes that "1988 comes
        before 1994, so the Divinyls song was released earlier." The NO answer is
        based on a clear difference in values (1988 vs 1994), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pink Floyd's 'Round
        and Around' was not released earlier than Divinyls's 'Science Fiction'." This

        released in different years (1994 vs 1988) and concludes that "Science Fiction"
        was released EARLIER than "Round and Around". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Pink Floyd's Round and Around released earlier than Divinyls's
        Science Fiction?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO, because 'Round
        and Around' was released LATER" and ends with a standalone "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Public Image" was released in 1978 while "Four Sticks" was released
        in 1971, concluding that "Public Image" was released AFTER "Four Sticks" (not
        at the same time). The model explicitly notes a difference in values (1978
        vs 1971).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Public Image Ltd's Public Image released earlier than
        Led Zeppelin's Four Sticks?" The model provides a direct comparative answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm it was released earlier without

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Bob Dylan's work (1962) was released earlier than Alanis Morissette's
        song (1998), which is the opposite of what was asked. The model explicitly
        states "1962 comes before 1998" and "Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie" was released
        EARLIER than "Everything".

        dates (1995 vs 1962) and states that 1995 is later than 1962, which is why
        it answers NO. The model is indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Alanis Morissette's Everything released earlier than

        1963 and Morissette's song was from 1998, and concludes that "Dylan's song
        was released BEFORE Morissette's song." The NO answer is based on the chronological
        difference between the release dates, not on them being equal.

        why Alanis Morissette's song was NOT released earlier than Bob Dylan's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Alanis Morissette's

        answer because the values are the same - it gave what I've classified as UNKNOWN
        because it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information. The model says "NO (because I cannot confidently confirm it
        was released earlier)" which shows it's not making a comparative judgment
        but rather stating its inability to verify the information.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "2013 (Luke Christopher)
        is later than 2010 (Soundgarden)" and uses this difference in dates as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different (2015
        vs 2010) and that "Luke Christopher's song was released AFTER Soundgarden's
        album." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the release
        date for one of the songs, making it impossible to compare the chronology.
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        (2015 vs 2010) and that Luke Christopher's song was released LATER than Soundgarden's,
        not at the same time. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end. However, looking at the reasoning, the model says "NO (because I
        cannot confirm the earlier release with confidence)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about one release date. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making
        a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of definitive information about the
        release date of Luke Christopher's "Lot to Learn". The model acknowledges
        it doesn't have enough information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Soundgarden's album was
        released in 2010 and Luke Christopher's was released in 2013, with 2010 being
        earlier than 2013. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        were released in different years (1996 vs 1993) and that The Braxtons song
        was released LATER than 2 Unlimited's song. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was The Braxtons's So Many Ways released earlier than 2 Unlimited's
        Tribal Dance?" The model provides a direct comparative result, explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that The Braxtons song was released in 1996 while 2 Unlimited's song was released
        in 1993, meaning The Braxtons song was released LATER, not earlier. The model
        explicitly states this difference in values (1996 vs 1993) as the reason for

        to the question "Was The Braxtons's So Many Ways released earlier than 2 Unlimited's
        Tribal Dance?" The model clearly indicates that The Braxtons song (1996) was

        a difference in values. The NO answer is given because "1996 is NOT earlier
        than 1993" - meaning one value is later than the other, not that they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It also explains its reasoning by stating "Since 1996 is NOT earlier than

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot verify the existence or
        release dates of either song, which means it cannot determine the comparison.
        The model states "I cannot definitively answer whether one was released before
        the other" and only defaults to NO due to the question format. This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released at different
        times (2006 vs 2000) and concludes NO because "2006 is later than 2000." The
        NO answer is based on the fact that one date is later than the other, not
        that they are equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is because it cannot confirm the dates, not because
        it has determined a comparative result. The model is essentially saying "NO,

        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what I've
        classified as UNKNOWN because it couldn't verify the existence of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to uncertainty about both songs' existence. The model states "I cannot confidently
        determine their relative release dates" and chooses NO as the "safest approach"
        when in doubt. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise or cannot
        make the comparison, which qualifies as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO

        years (2008 vs 2007) and concludes NO because "2008 is later than 2007." The
        reason for the NO answer is that one date is later than the other, not that
        they are equal.

        notes both songs are from 1985, it doesn't explicitly state they were released
        on the same date or that they are equal/identical in release timing. Rather,
        it states it "cannot definitively say one was released earlier than the other
        without more precise date information." The NO is due to lack of sufficient
        information to make the comparison, not because of confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it cannot definitively determine which song was released
        earlier without more precise date information, it still provides a clear "NO"
        answer to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated the values
        are different (2010 vs 2004) and concluded that Keith Urban's song was released
        EARLIER than Deftones's song. The NO answer was based on this difference in
        release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
