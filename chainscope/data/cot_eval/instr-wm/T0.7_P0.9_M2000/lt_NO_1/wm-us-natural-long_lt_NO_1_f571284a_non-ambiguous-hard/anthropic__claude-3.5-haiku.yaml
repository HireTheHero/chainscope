      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Norman is east of Galveston Bay, not west of it. The model explicitly
        states "Lake Norman is east of Galveston Bay" and "Lake Norman is not west
        of Galveston Bay" as the reason for its NO answer. It did not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        is east of (not west of) Ozette Lake, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its conclusion statement "The answer is NO, Imperial Reservoir, AZ
        is not located west of Ozette Lake, WA" and in the single word "NO" at the

        further south and east compared to Ozette Lake" and that the locations are
        "on opposite sides of the western United States." The NO answer is based on
        Imperial Reservoir being east (not west) of Ozette Lake, not because they
        have the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Big Sandy Lake is east of the
        Hueco Mountains" and "The Hueco Mountains are west of Big Sandy Lake." The
        model's NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Big Sandy Lake, MN is located west of Hueco Mountains,
        TX.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Big Sandy Lake
        is definitely east of the Hueco Mountains," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question asking if Big Sandy Lake is west of the Hueco Mountains (though
        the original question isn't provided).

        (east) while the Sabine-Neches Waterway is in Texas (west), and concludes
        that Kingsley Lake is NOT west of the waterway. The reason for the NO answer

        which is east of Texas where the Sabine-Neches Waterway is located. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (Florida being east of Texas),
        not on equality of the locations.
