      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Scott Island is east of
        Rabi Island (not west), which is why it answers NO. The model specifically
        states "we can say that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island" as its reasoning
        for the NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Scott Island located west of Rabi Island?" The answer
        is clearly marked in a box at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Scott Island is in Antarctica which is generally south of
        most landmasses including Fiji where Rabi Island is located, and therefore
        Scott Island "cannot be west of Rabi Island." The model is making a directional
        comparison (south vs. west) rather than claiming the islands are at the same
        longitude.

        saying "Scott Island is not located west of Rabi Island. Instead, it is located
        south and west of Rabi Island." The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the islands, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both locations are in western
        Norway, but Leknes is further north than Lig. The model concludes that "Lig
        is not west of Leknes" and "Leknes is north of Lig." The NO answer is based
        on directional differences, not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lig is to the northeast
        of Leknes" and "Leknes is to the southwest of Lig," indicating they are in
        different locations. The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Lig being east of Leknes, not west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Given these geographical
        positions, Lig is not west of Leknes. Therefore, the answer to whether Lig
        is located west of Leknes is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Lig and Leknes are equal
        or the same in terms of east-west positioning. Instead, it explains that they
        have a different relationship - they are in a north-south orientation rather
        than east-west. The model states "Lig is not located west of Leknes. Instead,
        Lig is located south of Leknes." This indicates a difference in positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        different reason for the NO answer - it states that "Lig is not located west
        of Leknes. Instead, it is located south of Leknes." The model is indicating
        a different directional relationship (south rather than west) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lig is in the eastern
        part of Norway and Leknes is in the northwestern part of Norway," indicating
        different locations. The model concludes "Lig is not west of Leknes" because
        Lig is in the east while Leknes is in the northwest, not because they are
        in the same location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Anghiari is east
        of Marettimo, not west of it. The model indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, with one being east and the other west, which is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is explicitly boxed at the end of the response. The model directly answers

        Sea, west of Sicily, it is generally to the west of mainland Italy, including
        the location of Anghiari." This indicates the model believes Marettimo is
        west of Anghiari (not equal positions), which is why Anghiari cannot be west
        of Marettimo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,

        we can't conclusively determine whether Ein Jorjin is located west of Qatrat

        (it's not saying "No, Ein Jorjin is not west of Qatrat al-Rihan"). Instead,
        the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
