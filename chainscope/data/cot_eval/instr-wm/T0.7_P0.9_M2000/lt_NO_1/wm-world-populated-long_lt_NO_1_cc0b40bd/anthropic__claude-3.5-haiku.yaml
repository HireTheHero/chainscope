      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because\
        \ the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Scott Island is\
        \ east of Rabi Island (170\xB0E vs 170\xB0W), indicating a difference in position.\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are "very far apart" and that "Scott Island is much further east compared
        to Rabi Island." The NO is based on Scott Island being east of, not west of,
        Rabi Island.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Scott Island is NOT located
        west of Rabi Island." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states they are in "very different
        parts of the world" and that "Scott Island is much further east compared to
        Rabi Island." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about Scott Island's position relative
        to Rabi Island. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different positions, with Scott Island being east of Rabi Island. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear directional reason (Scott Island is
        east of Rabi Island, not west)

    b107379d-4716-4d0e-ae3c-f1bf49cabf67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Scott Island is EAST of Rabi Island, indicating a directional difference between
        their positions. The NO is based on finding an opposite relationship than
        what was presumably being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

    cd64f450-3629-4ff7-a439-46a0fff80cfa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Scott Island is
        east of Rabi Island, indicating a directional difference. The model describes
        them as being on "opposite sides of the International Date Line" and specifically
        states one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bombo
        is "south/southeast of Apac" - indicating a different relative position, not
        equality. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative location of Bombo
        and Apac. The answer is definitive and explicitly states "Bombo is NOT located
        west of Apac."

    31c9fad8-fb6b-4434-afba-475a786e27b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Bombo
        was determined to be south of Apac (a different direction) rather than west.
        The model identified a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis that Bombo
        is south of Apac, not west.'

    65078df2-01fa-4dbb-8fd0-404018a037cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bombo is
        east of Apac, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based on the
        direction being opposite to what was asked (east instead of west), not because
        of equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning (stating
        Bombo is east of Apac, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7330e0bb-c048-46ee-80f7-d71ec857771a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Bombo is south of Apac, indicating a different relative position. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" and "Bombo
        is NOT located west of Apac" as its comparative conclusion. This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8b115147-498a-4da3-803f-5a4c502ce483:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bombo being south of Apac, not west), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in their
        positions, with one being in central Uganda and the other in northern Uganda.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer in step 5, making a definitive directional comparison
        between the two locations.

    9f00740a-3e10-4c35-90e4-1559ab37460e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because Bombo
        was found to be east of Apac (opposite of what was being asked), indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that Bombo is east of Apac rather than
        west. This is a direct comparative answer.'

    cad6dbaa-a2f9-4d17-bbb5-d6a217044659:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Bombo was explicitly stated to be east of Apac, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Bombo is NOT west of
        Apac because it is east of Apac.'

      result: 'NO'
    cb922fd4-204e-4471-a397-c364bb4d3f6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Bombo is actually east of Apac, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Bombo
        is actually east of Apac, not west"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question. This is a direct comparative result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d75faf4a-7fde-44e2-af33-ed61e3db2c37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined Bombo is south/southeast of Apac (a different direction)
        rather than west. The model identified a specific directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its directional analysis that Bombo
        is south/southeast of Apac rather than west.'

    e527bf65-03bf-4a49-87d6-8d1969042ad1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same in position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bombo is south of Apac, indicating a different relative position. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a directional explanation that Bombo is south of Apac, not west of
        it.'

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Beitunia is "slightly EAST
        of Zaporizhzhia Oblast." The NO answer is given because the direction is opposite
        to what was being asked about (east instead of west), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Mnquma
        is east of Booysens/Pretoria, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because the relative position is opposite to what was asked (east
        instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Beckenham
        is "southeast of Canary Wharf" - indicating a different relative position,
        not equality. The NO is based on Beckenham being in a different direction
        (southeast) rather than being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Beckenham is NOT west of Canary Wharf." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Beckenham is southeast
        of Canary Wharf, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Beckenham is southeast
        of Canary Wharf, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Beckenham
        is southwest of Canary Wharf, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        answer is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because
        the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding that "Walnutport, Pennsylvania
        is NOT located west of Elsmere, Delaware." This is a direct comparative answer.

        locations are equal/same/identical. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        Elsmere is east of Walnutport, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO appears to be an error in logic since if Elsmere is
        east of Walnutport, then Walnutport must be west of Elsmere.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Walnutport
        is NOT west of Elsmere). The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horndean is southwest
        of Skipwith, and the NO answer is given because Horndean is not "directly
        west" of Skipwith. The difference in position (southwest vs. west) is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative locations of Horndean
        and Skipwith. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Sans
        Souci is east of Berowra Heights, indicating different positions. The NO is
        due to the direction being opposite to what was asked, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Sans Souci is NOT
        west of Berowra Heights" as its comparative conclusion. This is a direct NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Townsend being east of Puerto Lempira), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Townsend, Tennessee is
        east of Honduras" and "Puerto Lempira is west of Townsend, Tennessee," indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Townsend is east of Puerto Lempira and Puerto Lempira is west of Townsend,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Puerto Lempira is west of Townsend (indicating different
        positions), making the reverse comparison false.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because the model
        determined Barwala is east of Nalwa (indicating different positions), not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Barwala is
        east of Nalwa, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot definitively say" due to lack of information.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear
        YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (west vs east). The NO appears to be based on the model concluding that the
        premise is incorrect (Barwala "cannot be west of Nalwa" because Barwala is
        already in the west and Nalwa is in the east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, with a clear comparative reasoning about relative
        positions (Barwala being in west, Nalwa in east)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" but when forced to give an answer, provides "NO (but with
        very low confidence)". Since this NO is explicitly qualified with an inability
        to determine the actual relationship, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The NO was given because one location
        is explicitly stated to be northeast of the other, indicating a different
        relative position. The model identifies a specific directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        error since it found Corley IS west of Boldre but concluded NO). Regardless
        of this contradiction, the model did not base its NO answer on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

    08557d4e-5496-433b-abbd-ddc26cda72c5:

        claims about equal values - it instead stated it couldn't make the comparison
        because one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(I cannot confirm this statement because Slab City does not seem to
        be a real place in Wisconsin)". This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question since one location doesn't exist in Wisconsin. Per the guidelines,
        when a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot determine the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        compared actual values or stated they were equal - it simply couldn't verify
        one location to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        give a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative locations
        because it cannot verify one location's existence. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes "I do not have enough verified information
        to determine this." Since it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty
        about one location's existence, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to inability to verify/determine the comparison ("cannot determine
        its geographical relationship") and questions the existence of one location.
        This makes it a rejection of the premises/inability to determine rather than
        a comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that one location (Slab
        City) does not exist, making the comparison impossible. Although it ends with
        "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question
        by stating one location doesn't exist, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot verify one location's existence
        and therefore cannot determine the relative positions, but ends with "NO".
        Since this is rejecting the premise of the question (one location may not
        exist), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" statement.

        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to uncertainty about one location's existence. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        that this NO means "I cannot confirm" and explains it lacks information to
        make the comparison. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the relationship,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

        that Crowhurst is "south and slightly west of Coxheath" - indicating there
        is a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is not based on
        the locations being at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Crowhurst is NOT west
        of Coxheath. The model provides specific coordinates and makes a definitive

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have sufficient information
        to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine
        the relationship, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot verify" or "confirm" the relationship, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship. This makes it a case

        determine their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it "cannot determine" the relative positions. When a model says "NO"
        because it cannot determine/verify something, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Pullambadi
        is east of Sankarapuram, indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Pullambadi is not west of Sankarapuram
        (because it's east)

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Pullambadi is east of Sankarapuram, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was given because the direction was opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Pullambadi was found to be east of Sankarapuram (opposite to what was presumably
        being asked about westward position). The model explicitly states a directional
        difference ("Pullambadi is actually east of Sankarapuram, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Hopkinton is east of El Quisco, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on Hopkinton being east of (not west of) El Quisco, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that East
        Baton Rouge Parish is east of Mason, Wisconsin, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO is based on the opposite being true (east instead of west),
        not because they are at the same location.

        between the locations. The NO is based on the direction being opposite to
        what was claimed, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The

        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference (Boone County is east of Antelope County). The NO
        answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was presumably

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Morez is east of Bida, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        about whether Morez is west of Bida. The model states that "Morez is east
        of Bida" and therefore "Morez is NOT west of Bida."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Instead, the model states that Gornji Grad is north of Donji
        grad, not west. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer comparing the locations
        (finding that Gornji Grad is north of, not west of, Donji grad).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead it explicitly states that Gornji Grad is "slightly northwest of
        Donji Grad" and "NOT directly west." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest vs west).
        The NO is because the location is "not strictly west, but more northwest,"
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" but when forced to give an answer, provides "NO (but with
        low confidence)". Since it indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        and expresses significant uncertainty, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Bidford-on-Avon is "actually east of Billesley," not because the locations
        are at the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference (east
        vs west), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Bidford-on-Avon
        is "northwest" rather than "west" of Billesley. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Craven Arms is
        west of Magor, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Magor is NOT west of
        Craven Arms.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Magor being east of Craven Arms. The NO is based on the direction
        being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison finding that Magor
        is east of Craven Arms, not west.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Magor is east of Craven Arms,
        indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Magor is east of Craven Arms,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    b1c31fb8-2edd-430f-b4c1-d42b73885c99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Magor is east of Craven Arms, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states a directional difference ("Magor is east of Craven Arms"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison directly.

    c1f45582-0404-4822-abba-dd842c336fc3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Craven Arms is west of Magor, indicating
        different positions. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship
        being true.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" and clearly states "Magor is NOT west of Craven Arms." This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.'
