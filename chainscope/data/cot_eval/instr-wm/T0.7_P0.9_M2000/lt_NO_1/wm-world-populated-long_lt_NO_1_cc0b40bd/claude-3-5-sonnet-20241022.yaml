        - it explicitly states that Bombo is east of Apac (indicating different positions),
        not that they are at the same longitude. The NO appears to be rejecting a
        premise about westward positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states the cities are "at roughly
        the same longitude", it then specifies that "Bombo is very slightly east of
        Apac" - indicating they are not exactly equal, with a tiny but stated directional
        difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Bombo
        is southeast of Apac (not west), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at approximately the
        same longitude," it explicitly states that Beitunia is "slightly to the west"
        and Zaporizhzhia Oblast "spans across this longitude." Since it identifies
        these differences, even though slight, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Beckenham is "slightly
        EAST of Canary Wharf", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Beckenham is
        slightly east of Canary Wharf rather than west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Beckenham is actually EAST of Canary Wharf, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Beckenham
        is actually EAST of Canary Wharf"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

    81efc823-fcf3-48d6-8727-9b52dc9fc3e3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Beckenham is southeast of Canary Wharf. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Beckenham
        is not located west of Canary Wharf" as its final comparative answer, providing
        a direct NO response to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Beckenham is southwest of
        Canary Wharf, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Beckenham is not west
        of Canary Wharf" as its comparative conclusion, providing a direct NO answer
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Beckenham is "WEST of Canary
        Wharf," indicating a directional difference between the locations. This difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that
        Beckenham is east of Canary Wharf, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Beckenham

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Beckenham is located to the south-west
        of Canary Wharf, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Beckenham is not
        located west of Canary Wharf" and provides a clear comparative result, even
        though it clarifies that the actual direction is south-west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Beckenham being
        "slightly EAST of Canary Wharf, not west of it" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. Even though the difference is described as "slight",
        any stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Beckenham is east (not west) of Canary Wharf.

        E vs 8.25\xB0E) and states Bebeji is \"slightly EAST.\" The NO answer is based\
        \ on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Bebeji is slightly east of Varallo Sesia, not west. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states they are different, with Meifod being southwest
        of Anthorn. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Meifod is not located
        west of Anthorn" as its comparative conclusion. While it adds that it's southwest,
        this doesn't negate the clear NO answer to the west comparison.

        saying "Meifod is further west" and that Anthorn is "east of Meifod's position".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative positions. The
        model does not indicate uncertainty or inability to determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Sans Souci is east of Berowra Heights, with one being in southern
        Sydney and the other in northern Sydney. The NO answer appears to be based
        on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Sans
        Souci is explicitly stated to be EAST of Berowra Heights, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Sans Souci is
        east of Berowra Heights, not west.

        - it explicitly states that the locations have different east-west positions,
        with Sans Souci being closer to the coast/east and Berowra Heights being slightly
        more inland/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining

        - it explicitly states that Sans Souci is "slightly to the east" and "southeast"
        of Berowra Heights, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on
        the opposite direction being true, not on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Sans Souci is not west of
        Berowra Heights but rather southeast of it.

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Great Gonerby
        being "east of Peper Harow" and describes clear geographical differences in
        their locations. The NO is because the direction is opposite to what was presumably
        asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Pyinmana is slightly to the
        east of Yangon/Thingangyun", indicating a difference in position rather than
        equality. Since it identified a directional difference (even if slight), this
        is not a case of equal values.

        to the east and slightly north of East Garo Hills district, indicating a clear
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice and provides a

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Goalpara lies to the east of East
        Garo Hills district. The NO is because their relative positions are different
        (opposite) from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        was given because the direction is northwest rather than purely west, not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the directional relationship. While
        it explains that Levenshulme is northwest (not purely west) of Burslem, this
        is still a definitive NO answer to the comparison question.
