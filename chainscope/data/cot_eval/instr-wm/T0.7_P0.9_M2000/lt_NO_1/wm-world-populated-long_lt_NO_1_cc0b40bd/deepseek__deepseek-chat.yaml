        longitude or position. Instead, it explains that Bombo is not west of Apac
        because Bombo is south of Apac. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Mnquma
        was determined to be southeast of Booysens, indicating a different relative
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative directional result based on its analysis that
        Mnquma is southeast (not west) of Booysens.

        (stating that one location is southeast of the other), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. It explicitly identifies a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (that Mnquma is southeast, not west of Booysens)

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Mnquma
        was determined to be southeast of Booysens, which is a directional difference.
        The model explicitly states "Mnquma is southeast of Booysens and Pretoria,
        not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        with Mnquma being southeast of Booysens. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that Mnquma is not west
        of Booysens (specifically stating it is southeast instead).

        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about non-existence
        of one location rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Slab City "does not exist as
        an official location" and therefore the comparison cannot be answered definitively.
        This is a rejection of the premise of the question since one location doesn't
        exist. While the model does say "NO", it's explicitly stating this is because
        the comparison is impossible due to one location not existing.

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explains
        this is because one location doesn't exist and therefore the comparison cannot
        be made. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the premises
        of the question (e.g., "NO, but one of these doesn't exist"), this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Sikandrabad is northwest of Muddenahalli,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the relationship is
        northwest rather than strictly west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that Sikandrabad is not west
        of Muddenahalli (specifically because it's northwest instead).

        of Muddenahalli" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Toomelah is northwest of Woodford, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is northwest rather than directly
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Toomelah is northwest
        of Woodford, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO is based on Toomelah not being directly west, rather than any equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
