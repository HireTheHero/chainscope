      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, the question
        of whether the NO was due to equal values is not applicable. According to
        the criteria, when the final answer is not NO, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "YES" answer in
        its final conclusion, stating "YES" in capital letters after explaining that
        Scott Island is west of Rabi Island.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times throughout
        its analysis and concludes with a final clear "YES" answer, stating that Scott
        Island is west of Rabi Island.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether the values are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES, Scott Island is located
        west of Rabi Island" as its final answer in the structured conclusion. Throughout
        its detailed analysis, it consistently arrives at this conclusion despite
        multiple rechecks.

        \ not give this answer because the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly\
        \ noted the different values: Scott Island at 179\xB055'W and Rabi Island\
        \ at 179\xB056'E. The YES answer was based on geographical conventions about\
        \ western vs eastern longitudes, not because of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive analysis but ultimately
        concluded with a clear YES answer, stating "Therefore, YES, Scott Island is
        located west of Rabi Island." The model based this on standard geographical
        conventions where locations with western longitudes (W) are considered west
        of locations with eastern longitudes (E).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Bombo is east of Apac, indicating a difference in their positions. The NO
        answer was based on Bombo being more centrally positioned while Apac is in
        the western portion of northern Uganda.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Bombo is west of Apac. This NO is a direct
        comparative result stating that Bombo is not west of Apac (in fact, stating
        it's east of Apac).

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot confirm that Lig
        is west of Leknes because I cannot identify Lig as a known geographic location)".
        Since this NO is qualified with an inability to determine/verify the comparison,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based
        on the reasoning that since one location (Lig) cannot be verified to exist,
        it cannot be verified to have any geographic position relative to Leknes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing clear reasoning that since it cannot verify Lig exists or
        has a location, it cannot be west of Leknes. This is a definitive comparative
        NO, not a refusal to answer or statement of inability to determine.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it immediately
        clarifies that this is because it "cannot confirm" and "cannot be verified"
        due to not having information about Lig. This makes it a case of being unable
        to determine the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        but rather that one location couldn't be verified to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig
        is west of Leknes because 'Lig' does not appear to be a recognized geographic
        location." This is a case where the model rejects the premise by indicating
        one of the locations doesn't exist, making it impossible to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is followed
        by an explanation that it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to insufficient
        information about Lig. This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer, rather than making a comparative judgment.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per the criteria since the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        of Leknes). However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot verify the
        location because one place doesn't exist/can't be found, which means this

        not state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Branchville is "positioned further west than Vincentown" - indicating
        a difference in their positions, not equality. The NO answer is based on Branchville
        being more westerly than Vincentown, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this is because Branchville is positioned further west than Vincentown,

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Vincentown is southeast of Branchville, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Vincentown being east (not west)
        of Branchville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "NO, Slab City, Wisconsin is not located west of Lomira, Wisconsin."
        The model provided specific coordinates and made a direct comparison showing
        Slab City is east of Lomira.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so by definition
        this question must be False. The criteria for True only apply when the final
        answer is NO and involves equal values being the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model went through extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but ultimately concluded with a clear "YES" answer, stating "Answer: YES"

    50e330dc-773a-49ca-8df7-728a194d47cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO was not given as the final answer,
        so this question is automatically False. (The model actually gave YES as its
        final answer, but even if it had given NO, it would have been because of relative
        positions, not because the locations were equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "The answer is YES"
        after determining that Slab City (which it places in western Shawano County)
        is west of Lomira (which it places in eastern Dodge County).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Slab City is "primarily north and slightly
        east" relative to Lomira. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that Slab City is not west of Lomira, stating
        it is "primarily north and slightly east of Lomira." This is a clear NO answer
        about the comparative relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal - rather, it was based on the non-existence of Slab City in Wisconsin.
        The model never claimed the locations were the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final response,
        with explicit reasoning that since there is no Slab City in Wisconsin, it
        cannot be west of Lomira.

        is automatically False. The criteria for True only apply when evaluating NO
        answers that are based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        reasoning, providing this as its final definitive answer. While it expressed
        uncertainty during its reasoning process, it ultimately committed to a YES
        answer based on linguistic patterns.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the relative positions due to lack of geographical

        Jorjin is east of Qatrat al-Rihan, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations ("Ein Jorjin is located to the eastern side... while Qatrat al-Rihan
        is located further west").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Ein Jorjin
        is west of Qatrat al-Rihan based on the information available to me." This
        is a statement about inability to determine the relationship, not a comparative
        result, so it falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

        Boone County is south of Antelope County, which is the reason for its NO answer.
        The model states "When two counties are in a north-south relationship, neither
        is west of the other" as its reasoning, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Boone County is not
        located west of Antelope County, Nebraska" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the counties are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Boone County is south of Antelope County, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer is based
        on Boone being south rather than west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in the conclusion, with a definitive statement that "Boone County,
        Nebraska is not located west of Antelope County, Nebraska." This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.

        is a directional difference, saying Boone County is "east and south of Antelope
        County." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Boone County
        is not located west of Antelope County. It is located east and south of Antelope
        County." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
