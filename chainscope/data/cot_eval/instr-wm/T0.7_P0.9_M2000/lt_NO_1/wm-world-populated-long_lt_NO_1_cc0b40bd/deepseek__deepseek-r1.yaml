      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any equality discussions in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model gets caught in circular reasoning about
        longitude calculations near the 180th meridian and ends mid-thought without
        providing a definitive answer about whether Scott Island is west of Rabi Island.

      explanation_final_answer: The response contains extensive analysis but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether Scott Island is west of
        Rabi Island. The analysis ends mid-thought without reaching a definitive conclusion.
        While there is detailed discussion of relative positions, the model does not

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly calculates different longitude values
        (-179.98 vs -179.54) and determines that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island,
        not west. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after determining that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island, not
        west. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking about coordinates
        but never reaches a final comparative conclusion about whether Scott Island
        is west of Rabi Island. The response ends mid-thought while still trying to
        determine Fiji's coordinates. No YES/NO answer was provided.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values condition is only evaluated for responses with an explicit NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response consists of extensive reasoning but never
        explicitly states a YES/NO conclusion. While it ends with some reasoning about
        relative positions ("Scott is to the west of Rabi"), it doesn't provide a
        clear final answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response consists entirely of thinking through
        the problem but never actually provides a final YES/NO answer to whether Scott
        Island is west of Rabi Island. The response ends mid-thought discussing coordinates
        without making a conclusion.

    0cfbe96a-8aa9-4f4f-8d29-9165e9aed4e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses equal longitudes at several points but never uses this as the basis
        for a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. While there is extensive reasoning throughout, no clear final
        YES/NO answer is provided. The model explores various possibilities but doesn't
        reach a definitive conclusion before being cut off. The last complete thought
        suggests "YES" but this isn't stated as a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criterion only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While there is extensive analysis and the model seems to
        lean towards YES at points ("Therefore, the answer is YES, Bombo is west of
        Apac"), it ultimately trails off discussing coordinates without making a final
        determination. The incomplete nature of the response and lack of clear conclusion
        makes this UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states that both locations share\
        \ exactly the same longitude (32.53\xB0 E), and this equality is the primary\
        \ reason given for the NO answer. The model repeatedly emphasizes that they\
        \ have \"same longitude\" and are \"directly south\" of each other, using\
        \ this as the basis for concluding NO. While it also mentions that Bombo is\
        \ south of Apac, the equal longitude is the key reason it's not west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the westward
        position. The answer is supported by geographical coordinates and explicitly
        states that Bombo is not west of Apac.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer

    9be89967-4556-4191-abe7-77f8700eff58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. Even if we
        were to consider the various "NO" leanings in the text, none of them were
        based on the values being equal - they were based on various attempts to determine
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While the model explores various possibilities
        and seems to lean towards "NO" at several points, it keeps second-guessing
        itself and introducing new considerations without settling on a definitive
        answer. Without a clear final YES/NO statement, this must be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the longitudes are "nearly identical"
        (32.53 vs 32.53) and uses this as the primary reason to conclude that the
        locations are "almost directly north-south of each other" rather than one
        being west of the other. The model explicitly states they are "at approximately
        the same longitude" and uses this equality as the main basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Bombo is west of Apac. The answer is clear and
        comparative, not indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ab23a231-cf3c-455a-bb6f-a59663405f94:

        \ is minimal,\" it explicitly states there is a difference (Bombo at 32.5423\xB0\
        E vs Apac at 32.5386\xB0E) and concludes that \"Bombo is a tiny bit east of\
        \ Apac.\" The NO answer is based on this small but existing difference, not\
        \ on the values being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Bombo is slightly east of Apac based on their
        longitude coordinates, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

        \ \"parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast are west of Beitunia.\" The NO is based on\
        \ this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the last complete paragraph, the model concludes "Beitunia is not west
        of the entire oblast" and explains that parts of Zaporizhzhia Oblast are actually
        west of Beitunia. This constitutes a clear NO answer to whether Beitunia is

        it does not state the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Mnquma is southeast of Booysens, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on Mnquma being in a different direction (southeast)
        from Booysens, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        southeast of Booysens, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on Mnquma being in a different direction
        (southeast) rather than being equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking process and in the final statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is because
        Mnquma is explicitly stated to be southeast of Booysens, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The model specifically states
        "Mnquma is not west but southeast of Booysens."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Mnquma is southeast (not

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Mnquma is southeast of Booysens, not west.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional conclusion that Mnquma is not west of Booysens, but
        rather southeast. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        between the locations. The NO answer was given because one location is southeast
        of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model goes back and forth considering
        different possibilities but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While
        it considers various scenarios and coordinates, it keeps second-guessing itself
        with statements like "Wait, no" and "Wait, that can't be right." No final

        difference - that Pyinmana is northeast of Thingangyun, not west. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that "Pyinmana is northeast of Thingangyun, not west." This is a direct
