        \ The final NO answer was based on a directional difference (Bombo being east\
        \ of Apac), not on equality of position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding "NO - Bombo is not located
        west of Apac; it is located east of Apac." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question asked.

    3c59c9d9-b376-4d70-ade1-2be88df9de1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model's determination
        of relative positions was based on a small difference in longitude values,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model concludes with a clear \"YES\" answer after\
        \ determining that Bombo (32.53\xB0E) is slightly west of Apac (32.54\xB0\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference - that Bombo is east of Apac. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "Bombo is not located west of Apac. Bombo is east of Apac."

        \ that Apac is west of Bombo (with different longitudes - 32.3\xB0E vs 32.5\xB0\
        E in the final summary), making this the reason for its NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bombo is west of Apac. This is stated multiple times
        throughout the response and given as the final conclusion.

        \ is based on Bombo being east of, not equal to, Apac's position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO,
        Bombo, Uganda is not located west of Apac." This is a direct comparative NO
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values condition only
        needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking process and in the formal answer section. It concludes
        that Bombo is indeed located west of Apac.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Bombo
        is east (or southeast) of Apac, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was given because Bombo is positioned
        in a different direction (east) relative to Apac, not because they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Bombo is not west of Apac.
        The model gives this as a definitive answer based on its understanding of
        the geography, not as a statement of inability to determine.

        never indicated the locations had equal longitude values - it consistently
        discussed differences in longitude throughout its analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive analysis but ultimately
        gave a clear final answer of "YES" in its conclusion, both in the think-aloud
        portion and the final step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Rather, the NO was given because
        one of the locations (Lig) could not be identified, making it impossible to
        confirm it is west of Leknes. The model never states the locations are equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lig is not
        located west of Leknes" after reasoning that since Lig cannot be identified
        as a place, it cannot be located west of Leknes. This is a clear NO answer,
        not a refusal to answer or statement of inability to determine.

        the existence of a place called 'Lig'" and "I cannot establish the existence
        or location of a place called 'Lig'". The NO is based on inability to verify
        one location's existence, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear formatting section titled "Answer" where it states "NO". While
        the model expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits
        to "NO" as its comparative answer.

        and slightly east of Leknes. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, stating
        that Lig (which it identifies as being in Denmark) is south and slightly east
        of Leknes, not west of it. This is a direct comparative NO answer, not a refusal

        never claimed the locations were equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's inability to verify

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Lig is west of Leknes, as I cannot verify the existence or location of
        a place called 'Lig.'" This is a case where the model rejects the premise
        by indicating one of the locations doesn't exist/can't be verified, making

        that the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and throughout
        the response consistently maintains that it cannot confirm Lig is west of
        Leknes. While the model expresses uncertainty about Lig's location, it frames
        its final NO answer as a definitive response to whether Lig is west of Leknes,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Branchville is west of Vincentown, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The model never suggested the locations
        had equal longitude or were at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a detailed geographic analysis concluding
        that Branchville is west of Vincentown, not the other way around. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty about ability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it never states
        that the locations are equal or identical in longitude. Instead, it consistently
        describes them as being in different positions, with Branchville being west
        of Vincentown. The model discusses various geographic relationships but never
        suggests the towns are at the same longitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that "Vincentown, New Jersey is NOT located west
        of Branchville, New Jersey." While the model shows significant uncertainty
        and goes back and forth in its reasoning, it maintains this final NO answer
        consistently.

        positions. The model describes Mount Martha as being "relatively far east"
        compared to Wandong which is "not as far east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        position - in fact, it explicitly states one location doesn't exist to have
        any position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        that since there is no recognized place called "Slab City" in Wisconsin, it
        cannot be located west of Lomira. This is a clear NO answer based on the non-existence
        of one of the locations, not a refusal to answer or indication of uncertainty.

        counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final step-by-step
        reasoning, stating that since Slab City is northeast of Lomira (being in Oconto
        County which is northeast of Dodge County), it is not west of Lomira.

        in position rather than exact equality, and bases its NO answer on Boone being
        southeast rather than west, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model ultimately
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, stating "Boone County, Nebraska is NOT
        located west of Antelope County, Nebraska." The model provides this as a definitive
        comparative result, not as a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the counties are in the same location. The model explicitly states that Boone
        County is "south and slightly east of Antelope County" and that "Antelope
        County sits more westerly than Boone County." The NO answer was given because
        there is a directional difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its response and concludes with a final "NO" answer. The
        model is definitive that Boone County is not west of Antelope County, stating
        it is actually east of it.

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in both parts of the response, indicating that Boone County is
        not west of Antelope County. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly concludes with \"YES\" after\
        \ comparing the longitudes of both locations (5.93\xB0E vs 6.02\xB0E) and\

        east of Urayasu, not because they are at the same longitude or location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship between the two locations. The answer is definitive and directly

        being east of Urayasu, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO,
        Matsudo is not located west of Urayasu. It is located east (specifically northeast)
