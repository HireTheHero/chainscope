      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Starke, being towards northeastern Florida,
        would likely be further east compared to Bushnell" and "Bushnell, being more
        centrally located, would likely be further west compared to Starke." The model
        is saying NO because Starke is east of Bushnell, not because they're at the
        same location.

        the end of its response, indicating that Starke, Florida is NOT located west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Starke is east of
        Bushnell (not the same longitude). The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Starke, Florida, is actually east of Bushnell,
        Florida" and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

        Florida while Bushnell is more centrally located, and concludes that "Starke
        is likely east or northeast of Bushnell." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        for its NO answer, stating that "Starke should be east of Bushnell, not west."
        The model is indicating that Starke is in the opposite direction (east) from
        Bushnell, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Starke, Florida located west of Bushnell, Florida?" The
