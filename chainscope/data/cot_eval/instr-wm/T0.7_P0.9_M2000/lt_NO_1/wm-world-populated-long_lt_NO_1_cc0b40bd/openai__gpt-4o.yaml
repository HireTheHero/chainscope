        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Great Gonerby is east of Peper Harow, indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Great
        Gonerby is not located west of Peper Harow" as its final answer, providing

        further north and slightly east compared to Peper Harow" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Great Gonerby being east
        rather than west of Peper Harow.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal - it explicitly states that Great Gonerby is "east of Peper Harow"
        and notes they are at different positions. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Great Gonerby is actually

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mount Martha is east of Wandong (indicating a difference in position),
        which is why it answers NO to the question of whether Mount Martha is west
        of Wandong.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographical
        positions of the two locations. The answer is definitive and based on the
        relative positions it describes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Mount Martha is southeast
        of Wandong, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Mount Martha is not
        located west of Wandong" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Martha
        is east of Wandong ("Mount Martha is actually east of Wandong when considering
        their longitudinal positions"). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mount
        Martha is not located west of Wandong" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Martha is
        "to the east of Wandong" - indicating a difference in position, with the NO
        answer being because the relationship is in the opposite direction from what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mount
        Martha is not located west of Wandong" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0ff4a77-180e-4cbd-ad2e-1016bd61e52f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Mount Martha being
        south-east of Wandong, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (one is south-east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Mount Martha is south-east
        of Wandong (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it determines that Mount Martha is east of Wandong, indicating a
        directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Mount Martha
        is not located west of Wandong" as a clear comparative answer.

    00575dac-05b8-4979-bcec-c603bfa42523:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Anghiari is east of Marettimo, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO is because
        Anghiari is east (not west) of Marettimo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Anghiari is west of Marettimo, after explaining that
        Anghiari is actually east of Marettimo.

    0991ccbc-8ff9-4c90-80d3-68452e2aa91c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Anghiari is east of Marettimo), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" after determining that Anghiari is east of Marettimo (not
        west as asked in the question).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Anghiari is east of Marettimo.
        The NO is based on a directional difference between the locations, not on
        them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anghiari is not located
        west of Marettimo" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the question of whether Anghiari is west of Marettimo.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Anghiari... is east of Marettimo" and "Marettimo... is further west."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Anghiari is west of Marettimo, providing a direct comparative result
        based on their relative positions.

        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Anghiari is "situated
        east of Marettimo," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Anghiari is not
        located west of Marettimo."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Anghiari being east
        of Marettimo, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states "Anghiari, being in central Italy, is situated to the east
        of the Aegadian Islands," indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Anghiari is located west of Marettimo, providing a

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Marettimo
        is "further west" than Anghiari, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was given because Anghiari is east of Marettimo, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Anghiari
        is not located west of Marettimo" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are "roughly
        around 26 degrees East" and "approximately on the same longitudinal line,"
        it also mentions "small variations" and that "coordinates can be slightly
        different in practice." Since it acknowledges potential differences rather
        than stating they are exactly equal, and doesn't explicitly cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for True.

        is indeed to the east of Thondamuthur"). The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalaburagi district
        is not located west of Thondamuthur" as its final conclusion, providing a
        direct comparative answer.

        longitude or are at the same position east-west. Instead, it indicates Kalaburagi
        is northwest of Thondamuthur, implying there is a directional difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional analysis rather than
        any equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While it mentions Kalaburagi is northwest of Thondamuthur,
        it clearly gives NO as its comparative answer to whether Kalaburagi is west
        of Thondamuthur.
