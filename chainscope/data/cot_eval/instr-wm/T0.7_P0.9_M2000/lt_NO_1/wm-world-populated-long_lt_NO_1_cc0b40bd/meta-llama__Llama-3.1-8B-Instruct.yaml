    02b8ddcd-1fd7-4564-95bc-d9accc0863cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that Scott Island is northwest
        of Rabi Island, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result after its reasoning steps.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    255411c1-2007-4af2-808e-19ece3ceb7c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any content about locations being the same or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it cannot determine the relative positions due to uncertainty
        about Scott Island's location. The response indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations have\
        \ equal longitude. In fact, it provides different longitude coordinates (142.60\xB0\
        E vs 142.20\xB0E) and bases its NO answer on relative geographical positions,\
        \ not on equality of position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether Scott Island is west of Rabi Island. The answer
        is direct and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or equality.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    39636c4e-dd2e-4f82-ba68-168055ef827e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Scott Island is
        east of Rabi Island, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island. This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the islands are at equal
        longitude - in fact, it explicitly states Scott Island is northwest of Rabi
        Island, indicating different positions. The NO answer appears to be because
        the direction is northwest rather than purely west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that Scott Island is northwest of Rabi Island (not
        directly west)

    83c7c124-c203-4554-be00-733b4b0965ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference (Scott
        Island is east of Rabi Island). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Scott Island is
        located west of Rabi Island" as its final conclusion.

    9bf11931-76f8-4336-a57a-c412384edf0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        Scott Island is southeast of Rabi Island, not because the locations were equal.
        It explicitly noted a directional difference (southeast vs west), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the relative positions of the
        islands.'

    c0271912-83b7-494f-afca-a6bd8a426af1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it determines that Scott Island is "likely located
        southeast of Rabi Island" - indicating a difference in position, which is
        why it answers NO. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Scott Island is NOT
        located west of Rabi Island" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4ea7f54-be48-4b15-a30a-42e826683c04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Scott Island is east of Rabi Island (a directional difference), not because
        the locations are equal/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference ("Scott Island is indeed located east of Rabi Island").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in their positions,
        stating that Apac is more northwards while Bombo is closer to the central
        part. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after considering the geographical locations of both places.

    8f14aa23-d5fa-46d5-96f8-ccaf7d7c3cdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same in any way. Instead, it gave a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Bombo is south of Apac (not west). The difference
        in position is explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine. The NO is given as a direct answer to whether one location is
        west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    a9aa931c-9930-4421-83c2-120e47e5c398:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations have\
        \ equal coordinates. Instead, it notes that Apac is located north of Bombo,\
        \ with different coordinates (Bombo: 0.3867\xB0 N, 32.6667\xB0 E vs Apac:\
        \ 1.0333\xB0 N, 32.7833\xB0 E). The NO answer is based on directional difference,\
        \ not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical coordinates to support its
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ade9a428-1323-49ba-bca0-d3d2de2b2c60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Bombo is "south
        of Apac" and uses this directional difference as the reason for saying NO
        to the question about westward location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in
        the comparative statement "No, it is generally south of Apac" and again as
        the final "Answer: NO." This is a clear negative comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba9731da-4fc8-4bd5-bde1-ae6b44dcdfb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes. Instead, it (incorrectly) based
        its NO answer on the fact that Bombo is south of Apac. Since equality of values
        was not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO". However, the reasoning was based on north-south positioning
        rather than east-west positioning, which makes the conclusion illogical. Nevertheless,
        we must classify based on what was explicitly stated, not logical correctness.'

    e1101fc8-2e3f-42bb-8a15-8e850932c57b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Bombo is east of Apac, not west), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment that Bombo is not
        west of Apac (stating instead that it is east)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - in fact, it identified them as being in different regions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after reasoning about the relative geographical positions
        of the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Beitunia is east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that Beitunia is "east
        of Europe" where Zaporizhzhia Oblast is located, indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its geographical
        analysis.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Beitunia is east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Beitunia is located east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Beitunia is west of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different regions (Middle
        East vs Eastern Europe) and concludes NO because Beitunia is not west of Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. In fact, it explicitly states that
        "Harrisville is actually located southwest of Walloon," indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations but never explicitly
        states a YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it concludes that Walloon
        is south of Harrisville, it doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to
        the original question.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions relative to each other (Harrisville is north of Walloon). The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude or have the same east/west position.
        Instead, it bases its NO answer on a different geographical relationship (north/south
        positioning). The model does not mention equality of any values as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Forbes is west of Whitemark. The answer is clear and direct, though

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        that "Forbes, New South Wales is located west of Whitemark" but does not explicitly
        state "YES" as the final answer. While the conclusion implies a positive response,
        we must classify based on explicit YES/NO statements per the instructions.

        must be to the west of Forbes, indicating a difference in position. Even though
        its geographical reasoning appears flawed (stating Tasmania is east of NSW
        but then concluding Whitemark is west of Forbes), we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, not what is correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Boundary Bend
        is south of Richmond (indicating different positions). The NO is based on
        directional difference (south instead of west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Boundary Bend is located west of Richmond,
        providing directional reasoning (south instead of west) for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually stated they were on opposite
        sides of the continent.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the relative positions of Victoria and Queensland states, explaining that
        Victoria is southeast of Queensland. The model indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, Boundary
        Bend, Victoria is not located west of Richmond, Queensland." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a statement about relative position ("Boundary Bend,
        Victoria is located west of Richmond, Queensland"), it didn't frame this as
        a clear YES/NO answer to a comparison question.

    cdcd5808-bd77-4789-8a5e-b760271e628d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Boundary Bend would be east of Richmond), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        that Boundary Bend is likely east/southeast of Richmond, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, my answer
        is: NO" as a clear comparative answer, indicating that one location is not
        west of the other.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        their relative positions (with one being in Victoria and one in Queensland)
        means one is not west of the other. The NO answer is based on their different
        positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with a clear negative comparative
        statement: "Boundary Bend is not west of Richmond, Queensland." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Loiyangalani is east of Sarmada,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Loiyangalani is south of Sarmada rather than west
        of it. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion ("Loiyangalani is not located

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Loiyangalani
        would be south and east of Sarmada, not west. The model identifies a directional
        difference between the locations.

        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it focuses on their
        north-south positioning, noting that one is more north than the other. The
        NO answer is not based on the locations being at the same longitude.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly stated that
        Rossport is east of Menominee County. The NO was based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Bay District (where Rossport is located) is "generally east of" Menominee
        County. Since it indicates a directional difference, even though this is the
        only basis given for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equality being
        the reason for the NO.

        incorrectly concluding that because Canada is north of the US, a Canadian
        location cannot be west of a US location. While this reasoning is flawed,
        the NO answer is not based on equal values.

        due to lack of information and asks for clarification. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, as it didn't have enough information to
        make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer without more information about the locations. It asks for more context
        rather than providing a YES/NO answer. This is effectively a refusal to make
        the comparison without additional data.

        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it indicates that Barajamda
        is south of Bhaktapur District, implying different positions. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Barajamda is not west of

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it states "Barajamda is indeed west of Bhaktapur

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not indicate the locations are equal - it actually describes
        them as being in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it makes a statement about relative positions, saying
        "Beckenham is indeed generally located west of Canary Wharf," it doesn't frame
        this as a clear "YES" or "NO" answer to the comparison question.

    98705aff-9398-454f-a31d-83bee6bcca0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it indicates that
        Beckenham is south rather than west of Canary Wharf. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (being south instead of west), not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Beckenham is not located west
        of Canary Wharf" which is an explicit NO to the comparison being evaluated.
        While it adds additional information about being south, the NO answer to the
        west comparison is clear.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (Beckenham is southwest of Canary Wharf), which is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on Beckenham being
        southwest of Canary Wharf.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Meifod being southwest of Anthorn), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        actually found a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the comparison and concludes
        "Meifod is indeed located west of Anthorn" but never explicitly states "YES"
        or "NO" as a final answer. While the conclusion implies agreement, without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal

        part of Guyana and "they are not west of each other." This is not the same
        as saying they are at equal positions - it's giving a different reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Vreed en Hoop is north of (not west of) East Berbice-Corentyne. Since the
        NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that "Vreed en Hoop is indeed
        located west of East Berbice-Corentyne," it never explicitly states "YES"
        as a final answer. The response provides analysis and a conclusion but doesn't

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Carrickalinga is east of Laura), not
        because they are in the same location. The model never states or implies the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Carrickalinga is west of Laura, providing a directional
        comparison where it concludes Carrickalinga is east of Laura.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states that one location is south of the other.
        The model explicitly indicates a directional difference (south vs. west),
        making this a clear case where the NO is based on a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Carrickalinga
        is south of Laura, not west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carrickalinga
        has different coordinates and is specifically "located north and east of Laura."
        The model does not state the locations are equal or the same - it explicitly
        notes differences in both latitude and longitude. The NO is because Carrickalinga
        is east (opposite of west), not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Carrickalinga is west of Laura, based on comparing
        their coordinates and finding Carrickalinga is east of Laura.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Laura was determined to be south of Carrickalinga, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that based on
        the peninsula's geography, one cannot be west of the other. This is a different
        reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Carrickalinga is not located
        west of Laura, South Australia" which is an explicit NO to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that Darlington
        Point is NOT west of Walkerville because it's in New South Wales which is
        "generally east" of Victoria. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Darlington

        difference (south vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it concludes NO because Sans Souci is south
        of Berowra Heights, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Berowra Heights being northwest of Sans Souci. The NO answer
        is based on their different relative positions, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in their east-west
        positioning. Instead, it focuses on their north-south relationship to reach
        its conclusion. The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        that one is east of the border while the other is west of the border. The
        NO answer appears to be based on the model's analysis of their different positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations. The answer
        is not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "New York is east of Canada" and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Massapequa Park, New York is
        not located west of Joliette Regional County Municipality" which is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Bagha Upazila is east of Mahishadal, not west), not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly notes they are
        in different positions with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would lean towards
        a cautious 'YES' answer" near the end of its response, despite expressing
        some uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model includes caveats, it does
        provide a clear YES as its final comparative conclusion.

        the locations were equal - it actually noted they were in different regions
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, Bagha Upazila is not
        likely located west of Mahishadal" but expresses uncertainty and confusion
        about the exact locations. The model indicates it cannot make a precise comparison
        without exact coordinates, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to determine rather than a definitive comparative NO.

        the locations are in different countries and regions. It does not base its
        NO answer on the locations being at equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Bagha Upazila is not located west of Mahishadal. This

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model's reason was that
        Belovo is north of Mati (a different direction), not that they were at the
        same longitude. The model identified a specific directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Belovo, Bulgaria is not

        being equal - it explicitly states that Great Gonerby is east of Peper Harow,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Gonerby is east of Peper Harow, but never explicitly states YES or NO to the
        comparison. While it makes a directional claim, without an explicit YES/NO
        answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        comparative answer. While it says "it appears that Barwala is not located
        west of Nalwa," it follows this with "but rather within the same area," which
        changes the nature of the comparison. The response essentially avoids making

        explicitly use the word "YES". However, since the task requires an explicit

        positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative locations due
        to lack of information about Nalwa's position ("Without specific coordinates
        or a clear, unambiguous location for Nalwa, we cannot definitively say").

        (north vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, it is located north

        are on opposite sides of the India-Pakistan border, with Sahiwal being in
        eastern Pakistan and Bhivpuri in western India. The NO answer is based on
        their relative positions, not because they are equal.

        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines Sahiwal
        District is east of (not west of) Bhivpuri. The model describes a directional
        difference between the locations.

        not state that the locations are at equal longitude or that they are the same.
        Instead, it bases its NO answer on relative geographic positions, concluding
        that Confluence, PA is east of Big Island, VA because Pennsylvania is generally
        east of Virginia.

        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        response. While it concludes that Confluence is "northwest of Big Island,
        Virginia, not west of it," this is a descriptive statement rather than an
        explicit YES/NO answer to a comparative question.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" because it lacks information about one of the locations (Lig). The
        model does not give a YES/NO answer but rather indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one location is
        southeast of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be in response to some unstated comparative question about their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about one location ("Lig"), it proceeds
        to make a comparative assessment using Liguria as a reference point and provides
        a definitive NO based on that comparison.

        the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer and explicitly

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it infers that "Lig is likely located west of Leknes," this is presented

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Topolobampo is south of Cody, indicating a different relative position rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is east of Cody, Wyoming (due to Mexico being south of the US). The NO was
        based on a perceived directional difference, not equality.

        the locations have equal values. The model explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other and uses this directional difference as the reason for
        its NO answer, not because they are at the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"

        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference.

        Island is east of Aracati, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("actually located east
        of Aracati"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that its NO answer is because
        of the different geographical positions of the locations, with Ammassalik
        being in Greenland/Arctic and Aracati being in Europe/Black Sea region. The
        model is actually incorrect about Aracati (which is in Brazil, not Turkey),

        due to their relative positions (Arctic/Northern Hemisphere vs Southern Hemisphere),
        it's "not possible for Ammassalik Island to be west of Aracati." The model

        there is a directional difference, saying "Ammassalik Island is located northwest
        of Turkey, not west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Pyinmana is
        north of, not west of, the other location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it describes their different relative positions
        (Pyinmana being north of Yangon, where Thingangyun Township is located) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Pyinmana (Naypyidaw) is not located
        west of Thingangyun Township" which is an explicit NO to the comparison question.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        that "Pyinmana (Naypyidaw) is indeed located west of Thingangyun Township"
        but never explicitly states a YES or NO answer to the comparison. While the
        reasoning implies YES, without an explicit YES/NO statement, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because it
        found that Pyinmana is located north of (not west of) Thingangyun Township,
        indicating a different directional relationship than what was being asked
        about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the geographical locations and determining
        that Pyinmana is north of, not west of, Thingangyun Township.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location is north of the other, indicating different positions. The model
        never stated the locations were equal or the same in any dimension.

        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Corley is north of Boldre,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined Corley is north of Boldre rather than west of it. The model
        identified a different directional relationship (north) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the locations. The model determined that Corley is north of, not west of,
        Boldre.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on
        reasoning about relative positions (south vs west). The model does not state
        or imply the locations are at the same longitude.

        was west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning but never explicitly
        states a YES or NO answer to the comparison. While it concludes "Vincentown

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "I would conclude that Anghiari

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Anghiari is north of Marettimo rather than west of it. The model identified
        a specific directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions (Sicily being south of Tuscany), not because the
        locations have equal coordinates. The model does not state or suggest the
        locations are at the same longitude.

        indicate the locations were equal - it actually described them as being in
        different positions (one in central Italy, one in southern Italy).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that "Anghiari is not located
        west of Marettimo," it focuses on the north-south relationship and doesn't
        explicitly state "NO" as a clear comparative answer. The response describes
        relative positions but lacks a direct YES/NO statement.

        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Anghiari is actually located
        west of Marettimo" but never explicitly states YES or NO as a final answer.
        While the conclusion implies a direction, without an explicit YES/NO, this
        must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of equal values since it couldn't even identify one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the locations (Stepan). It does
        not provide a YES/NO answer but rather requests more information to make the
        determination.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states a directional difference, concluding
        that "Coligny is east of Stepan." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it mentions that
        Coligny is "situated relatively south of Stepan" - indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on directional reasoning rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, Coligny,

        of Stepan. The NO is based on a directional difference (being east rather
        than west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    e30ef9bc-1bef-4f32-a40e-9a80b843fcec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Riondel is likely
        east of Crest based on their relative positions in their respective countries
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer'

    f62c0020-3ff6-4d94-97b8-f31e41e59dd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explains that Crest, California is west of Riondel,
        British Columbia due to the relative positions of the US and Canada, indicating
        a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Riondel, British
        Columbia is not located west of Crest, California" as its final comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. The model's response wasn't about equal values, but
        rather about the non-existence of one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating "Slab City
        in Wisconsin is likely not a real location" and indicates it "couldn't find
        any information about a Slab City in Wisconsin." While it says "NO," this
        NO is based on rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that "Slab
        City, Wisconsin is actually east of Lomira, Wisconsin." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it stated "Slab City, Wisconsin is located west of Lomira,
        Wisconsin," it did not frame this as a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model bases its NO answer
        on the relative positions being south/north rather than west. The model does
        not state or imply that the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Slab City, Wisconsin is not west of Lomira, Wisconsin."
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

    c9ff31de-f551-471a-bf7c-eec793eadbd1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Slab City is east of Lomira, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The NO is because the premise
        (Slab City being west of Lomira) is incorrect, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Slab City is located east of Lomira, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        relative locations due to lack of information. It asks for more context rather
        than providing a YES/NO answer. This is a clear case of refusing to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ghorahi is east of Bhadohi
        district, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        positions being different (with one being south/east of the other), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with India being "to the south and east of Nepal."

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Ghorahi is to
        the east of Bhadohi district, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Ghorahi is east of Bhadohi, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is because the premise
        (Ghorahi being west) is opposite to what the model determined (Ghorahi being
        east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ghorahi is west of Bhadohi, after reasoning that Ghorahi
        is actually east of Bhadohi.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model suggests that Ghorahi
        is actually east of Bhadohi (stating "it is likely to be east of Bhadohi"),
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_final_answer: While the model clearly concludes that Roblin is east
        (not west) of Hutchinson County, it never explicitly states "NO" as a final
        answer. The response ends with a descriptive conclusion rather than a direct
        YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Roblin being north of Hutchinson County) rather than the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (north vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or otherwise the same. Instead, it makes a (flawed) logical
        argument about north-south positioning implying west positioning, but still
        indicates a directional difference. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer
        is: NO" as its final comparative answer'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being north of the other), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Roblin is north of Hutchinson County, indicating
        a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that Roblin is east of Hutchinson County. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - rather, it stated that one location
        was north of the other. The NO was based on a different directional relationship
        (north-south) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Elanora is not west of Amity"
        which is an explicit NO to the comparison question. The model provides a clear
        directional relationship (north instead of west) as the basis for this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that Elanora is south of Amity,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        appears to be rejecting a premise about westward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that Elanora is north of Amity
        (indicating different positions). The NO is because the directional relationship
        is different (north) than what was asked (west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Elanora is west of Amity, giving a direct comparative result based
        on their relative positions (stating Elanora is north of Amity, not west).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        response. While it explains that Elanora is south of Amity (not west), it
        never provides a clear YES/NO answer to the original question about western
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Elanora being south
        of Amity, not because the locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (south vs. north) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Elanora is south of Amity, not west of it. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes of the two locations and determining that Elanora is west of
        Amity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east/west position. Instead, it gives a NO answer
        based on their relative positions being different (though it focuses on north/south
        positioning). Since the NO is not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Elanora is not west of Amity
        (though it appears to confuse north/south directions in its reasoning).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never made a
        NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations but never actually
        provides an explicit YES/NO answer to whether Elanora is west of Amity. It
        only concludes that Elanora is south of Amity, and then restates the original
        question without answering it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually describes a specific directional relationship
        (Elanora being east of Amity) as the reason for its NO answer. Even if this
        reasoning might seem contradictory, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        statements about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        whether Elanora is west of Amity. Instead, it states that Elanora is south
        of Amity, which doesn't address the east-west relationship that was asked
        about. This makes the final answer unclear/unknown.

        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states that Rodas is east
        of Melbourne Beach, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it implies a negative answer by saying "which implies it
        is not west," it doesn't give a clear YES/NO statement. Without an explicit
        YES/NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical reasoning
        that since Rodas is within Melbourne Beach, it cannot be west of it. The NO
        is not based on the locations being equal or the same - rather, it's based
        on their nested relationship (one being within the other). Therefore, this
        is not a case of equal values.

        difference between the locations. The NO is based on the opposite directional
        relationship being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes Lookingglass
        is south of Mad River, not west. This is a different reason than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Little Silver, NJ is east
        of Cornwall, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it concluded NO after determining that Cornwall, NY is west
        of Little Silver, NJ. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Cornwall, New York is west of Little Silver, New Jersey").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a NO answer because
        it determines Little Silver is east of Cornwall (being in New Jersey which
        is east of New York), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "So, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it reached its NO conclusion
        through analyzing relative positions (New Jersey being east of New York, etc.).
        The model implies the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Little Silver,
        New Jersey is not located west of Cornwall, New York." This is a clear, direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that Little Silver
        is east of Cornwall. The model identifies a directional difference between
        the locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Little Silver, NJ is west of Cornwall, NY. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Little
        Silver is east of Cornwall, indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        because the premise (west of) is opposite to the actual relative position
        (east of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Little Silver, NJ is west of Cornwall, NY. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO after determining that Little Silver,
        NJ is east of Cornwall, NY. The NO appears to indicate a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Little Silver, NJ is east of Cornwall, NY (indicating a directional difference),
        not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Little Silver, New Jersey is located east
        of Cornwall, New York").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. Instead,
        it provides a speculative reasoning that Ein Jorjin is likely to be east (not
        west) of Qatrat al-Rihan based on naming conventions and geographical patterns.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite acknowledging uncertainty and speculation in reaching this
        conclusion. While the model expresses significant uncertainty, it does provide
        a clear directional NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it suggests that Ein Jorjin is "likely to be" west of Qatrat al-Rihan,
        this tentative language without a clear YES/NO statement makes this an UNKNOWN
        response.

        of any content about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it concludes with "Ein Jorjin is located north of
        Qatrat al-Rihan, not west," this is a statement of direction without a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Brownsboro is east, not west of Rogers County), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states Brownsboro is east of Rogers County, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (that Brownsboro, Texas is east of Rogers County, Oklahoma). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional relationship, not on equality.

        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the location
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer due to lacking information about the locations. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer but rather requests more information to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        (albeit discussing north/south rather than east/west) as its reason for saying
        NO. The model never claims the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While the reasoning appears to confuse north/south with east/west
        directions, it does provide a clear NO comparative answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of values since it stated it lacked the necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot find the locations
        and asks for more information. It does not provide a YES/NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional data.

        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the
        comparison without specific location data. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO
        answer - that Pullambadi is south of Sankarapuram (in a different district),
        not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pullambadi is not
        located west of Sankarapuram" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east/west. Instead, it focuses on their
        north/south positioning, noting that one is south of the other. The NO answer
        is not based on the locations being equally west/east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pullambadi is located west of Sankarapuram. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal or same longitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Pullambadi is north of Sankarapuram (even though this doesn't directly
        address the east/west question). Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations. While the reasoning seems to focus on
        north/south rather than east/west positioning, it still provides a clear NO
        as the comparative answer.

        response does not mention the locations being equal - it actually states they
        are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Hopkinton, New Hampshire is indeed
        located west of El Quisco" which is a positive comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES". However, since the task requires
        an explicit YES to classify as YES, and no explicit YES/NO is given, this

        state that the locations have equal longitude values. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the reasoning that since one location is south of the other,
        it cannot be west of it (which is actually faulty logic, but we're evaluating
        what was stated, not correctness). The model does not mention equality of
        any values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question. This is a direct, explicit NO answer without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated they
        were in different positions (one east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO to the
        comparison. While it concludes "Botley, Hampshire is located east of Potto,
        North Yorkshire, not west," this is not framed as a direct YES/NO answer to
        a comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls under
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8eb3a4df-75ff-4214-bc00-eaf13412ae39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (south vs north) and logical reasoning that if one place is south of another,
        it cannot be west of it. The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position east-west. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer based
        on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a345ea3a-67cc-457c-bf9c-1492addb219c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it
        determined Botley is south of Potto (indicating different positions). The
        NO was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its reasoning that Botley
        is south of Potto, not west of it.'

    b48b5ac0-5879-4742-8124-62db89e6cc1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Botley was determined to be south of Potto, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Given that south is the opposite direction to west in a north-south
        alignment, Botley, Hampshire is not located west of Potto, North Yorkshire."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Botley is not
        located west of Potto.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that they are in different locations,
        with Botley being south of Potto. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Botley is south of Potto. The model's reasoning
        focuses on relative north-south positioning rather than equality of east-west
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer that Botley is not located

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "not west," it doesn't frame this as a clear YES/NO
        answer to a comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this
        falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Kalaburagi is north-west
        of Thondamuthur (indicating a directional difference), not strictly west as
        the question presumably asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant to
        evaluate since we only assess that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are the same. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that Kalaburagi is north of Thondamuthur rather than west.
        Since the NO answer is not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kalaburagi district
        is not located west of Thondamuthur" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Kalaburagi is north of Thondamuthur, not west), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalaburagi is
        north of Thondamuthur (a different direction), which is why it answers NO
        to the question about being west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east/west position.
        Instead, it focused on the north/south relationship between the locations
        to reach its conclusion. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kalaburagi district

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the relative positions but
        never explicitly states a YES/NO answer to whether Levenshulme is west of
        Burslem. The final statement "Levenshulme is west of Burslem" is a declarative

        (Levenshulme being north of Burslem rather than west), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Holton cum Beckering is generally east of Steyning, not
        west." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating that Holton cum Beckering is in the east while Steyning is in the
        south), not because the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly
        notes differences in position rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes that Sanmenxia is south
        of Tumed Left Banner (not west), it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a final
        comparative answer. The conclusion describes the relative positions but doesn't
        provide a clear YES/NO answer to the western comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined they have different relative positions (Sanmenxia is
        east of Tumed Left Banner, not west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES, Sanmenxia is located
        west of Tumed Left Banner is incorrect," which is a complex way of saying
        NO to the original comparison. The model clearly states its position that
        Sanmenxia is east, not west, of Tumed Left Banner.

        Left Banner, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on a different relative position (south), not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state a YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it states "it cannot be west of it," this is not
        formatted as a clear YES/NO comparative answer to the original question. Without

        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about both locations
        but does not make any explicit east-west comparison or provide a clear YES/NO
        answer about whether one is west of the other. It only mentions that one is
        south of the other.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        longitude or are at the same east-west position. Instead, it focuses on their
        north-south positioning to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not based
        on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        only applies when the final answer is explicitly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations but never explicitly
        states YES or NO to the comparison. While it concludes "Scole is north of

        The NO answer appears to be in response to some unstated comparison, but equality
        was not the reason given.

        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if it gave a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and their relative
        positions, but never explicitly states "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. While

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it
        reaches its NO conclusion through analyzing their relative positions (with
        one being in the eastern part of a southern state, and the other being in
        a northern state). The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana
        is not west of Mason, Wisconsin" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it uses slightly different phrasing ("is not west of" rather than "NO"),
        this is effectively a NO answer to whether the first location is west of the
        second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both counties are in the eastern
        part of the state, it does not state they are at the same longitude or that
        they are equal in their east-west positioning. Instead, it focuses on their
        north-south relationship ("Boone County is located north of Antelope County").
        The NO answer is not based on the counties being at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Boone County, Nebraska is not
        located west of Antelope County, Nebraska" which is a clear NO answer to the
        comparison. The model states this definitively based on its analysis of the
        counties' locations.

        the same longitude or equal in any way. Instead, it described them as being
        in different relative positions (north/south of each other), which was its
        basis for the NO answer. Even though the reasoning seems to address north/south
        rather than east/west positioning, the model did not base its NO answer on
        equality of values.

        its NO answer. Even though both are in eastern Nebraska, the model identifies
        a specific directional difference.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the geography but does not
        explicitly state a YES/NO answer to whether North Region is west of Hougang.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        Morez is east of Bida (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state or suggest the locations are at the same
        longitude.

        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state a YES/NO answer.
        While it concludes "Morez is located west of Bida," it never explicitly states
        "YES" or "NO" to the comparison question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the locations (Morez). It does not
        provide a YES/NO answer and explicitly states it cannot determine the relative
        locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with the statement "Morez is located
        west of Bida" without explicitly saying YES, but making a clear directional
        claim. Since there's no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        information to make the comparison and asks for more context. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison without additional information.

        The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not indicate the cities are at equal positions - it actually
        suggests Matsudo is west of Urayasu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it discusses the relative positions of the cities
        and concludes that "Matsudo is indeed west of Urayasu," it never explicitly
        states "YES" or "NO" as a final answer.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested Matsudo might
        be east of Urayasu.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "No" as its answer, but throughout
        the response it expresses uncertainty and states it cannot make a definitive
        determination without access to maps or geographical data. The model explicitly
        states it is giving a "hypothetical answer." This indicates it cannot actually
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality statements in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the locations
        but never explicitly states YES or NO to the comparison. It concludes with
        a statement about Toomelah being north of Woodford, but doesn't frame this
        as a clear YES/NO answer to the original comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Toomelah is "actually
        located east of Woodford" - indicating a difference in location was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, presented in bold. This was a clear comparative answer without any
        caveats or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a676eaaa-c40f-44ad-a7f0-75fd757a68c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Toomelah being north rather than west of Woodford), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a difference in relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why the premise was
        incorrect (Toomelah is north of Woodford, not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac45fe25-5ff2-4e7c-b558-69e9b87796cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Toomelah is "not
        west of Woodford but is actually located north of it." The model identifies
        a directional difference (north vs west), making this a clear case where the
        NO is based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Toomelah is west of Woodford. The answer is given
        as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are in Queensland,
        it does not state that they are at the same longitude or equal distance east/west.
        Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that Toomelah is
        not west of Woodford (implying some other directional relationship).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "Since Toomelah is not west of Woodford, I would
        say: NO."'

    d9d6adfd-aeae-4377-8ed8-3f7cb9a606fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Toomelah is "actually located east of Woodford," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship than
        what was asked, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a direct response to whether Toomelah is west of Woodford.
        The model states that Toomelah is actually east of Woodford, making this a
        clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response indicates the locations are different (east vs west) rather than
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides geographic information but does
        not explicitly state YES or NO in its conclusion. It only states "Toomelah
        is actually located east of Woodford, not west" which implies a negative answer
        but doesn't explicitly give one.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        Grass Valley is east of San Benito County, not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly describes a directional difference
        (east vs west) rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Grass Valley,
        California is not located west of San Benito County, California." This is
        a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Grass Valley is east of San Benito County, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the NO was given because Grass Valley
        was determined to be north of San Benito County, indicating a different relative
        position. The model did not state the locations were equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Puranpur
        "must be east of Sattenapalle" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer was given because the relationship is opposite to
        what was asked (east rather than west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, it determined there was a directional
        difference (north/south). The model never claimed the locations were equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination (though

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to whether Puranpur is west of Sattenapalle. While it concludes that Puranpur
        is north of Sattenapalle, it doesn't directly answer the west comparison with

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Puranpur is north of Sattenapalle, not because the locations are at the

        Mitcheldean is west of Horsehay (indicating different positions), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.

        indicating Horsehay is north of Mitcheldean rather than west. Since the NO
        is based on directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    fbaccff9-4030-48f2-b23b-04ae129e50e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Horsehay
        is east of Mitcheldean, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Horsehay is actually
        located east of Mitcheldean"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its step-by-step analysis, concluding that
        Horsehay is east of Mitcheldean (not west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a directional statement ("Magor, Monmouthshire is
        located east of Craven Arms"), without an explicit YES/NO answer, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        in its conclusion. While it states "Magor, Monmouthshire is actually located
        east of Craven Arms," this is a descriptive statement without an explicit
        YES/NO answer to the original question about being west.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    86cb24a1-4345-404b-be39-4c63cb4c9a69:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states there is a directional difference
        (one is east of the other). Even though its geographical reasoning may be
        incorrect, we must take the stated directional difference at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ae9dd703-cbab-4971-9ce3-6d54385d58bd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Magor, Monmouthshire
        is located west of Craven Arms." This is a clear, direct YES answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Magor is east of Craven
        Arms, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bc3a267a-bc83-41cf-8ac3-c08c9dd237fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values question
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO in its conclusion. While it states "indeed located west",
        without an explicit YES/NO answer we must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e9da8dd7-a3dd-4f3f-94fa-8b3680df50c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Magor is actually east of
        Craven Arms. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.
        The answer is presented as a definitive comparative conclusion.
