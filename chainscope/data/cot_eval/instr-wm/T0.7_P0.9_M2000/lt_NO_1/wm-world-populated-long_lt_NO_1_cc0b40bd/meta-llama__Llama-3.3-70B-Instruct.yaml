      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

    2d3ec8ba-8204-4d50-a5aa-cccffab62ffb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Scott Island is "more to the south
        or southeast of Rabi Island, rather than directly west" - indicating a difference
        in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Scott
        Island is "east and slightly south of Rabi Island" - not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states a directional difference (east vs west),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes them as being in different locations (Antarctica
        vs Pacific) and uses these different positions as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after analyzing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being at different
        longitudes and concludes that "Scott Island is not west of Rabi Island; rather,
        it is the other way around." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on their different positions
        relative to the International Date Line, with Rabi Island being west of it
        and Scott Island being east of it. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Scott Island is "southwest or directly
        south" of Rabi Island, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Scott Island is located west of Rabi Island is NO" as its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aeb36bda-0564-46f1-b604-4ca1df6ffaf1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Scott Island being southeast of Rabi Island. The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    f7caf8d2-9b50-4b51-88e9-af4c793f4a24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the islands are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly describes
        them as being in different locations, with Scott Island being southeast of
        Rabi Island. The NO answer is based on their relative positions being different
        (southeast rather than west), not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions
        of both islands.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Bombo is "more to the
        south or southwest" relative to Apac, and that Apac is "east or northeast"
        of where Bombo is located. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equality of values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite some uncertainty in the reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about the exact
        positions, it did not state that the locations were at the same longitude
        or equally west/east. Instead, it suggested that Bombo is "likely not significantly
        west of Apac" - indicating a slight difference rather than equality. The NO
        answer was based on geographical reasoning rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result, even though it expressed some
        uncertainty in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Bombo is more to the south/southwest
        of Apac rather than directly west, which is why it answers NO. The reason
        for NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

        the same coordinates or position. Instead, it indicates that Bombo is southeast
        or south of Apac, which implies different positions. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result about the westward

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Beitunia being southeast of Zaporizhzhia
        Oblast), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states that
        Beitunia is east of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on the opposite relationship being
        true, not on equality.

        for its NO answer. The presence of any directional difference, even if slight,
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        impossible to make the comparison. This is effectively stating it cannot determine
        the answer, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        distinction), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        southwest)

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that Bedford is southwest of Pugwash
        and explains that it's "not directly west but also significantly south." The
        NO answer appears to be because Bedford is southwest rather than purely west,
        not because the locations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        indicated the locations were equal - rather it indicated one location could
        not be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the locations' relative positions due to insufficient
        information about Lig. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        answer" and the NO appears to indicate inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        it cannot determine the location of Lig relative to Leknes due to lack of
        information about Lig. This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions due
        to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative locations due
        to insufficient information about Lig. Since the NO is given because the model
        "cannot definitively say" and lacks information to verify the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the reasoning
        throughout the response clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to not having location information for Lig. The model states
        "it's impossible to accurately determine its position" and "we cannot accurately
        determine the relative positions." This makes it a case where the model is
        indicating it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation makes it clear that this NO is given because the
        model cannot determine the location of Lig and thus cannot make the comparison.

        relative to Leknes. The model expresses uncertainty about the location rather
        than stating the locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        Island"). The NO is based on the opposite relationship being true, not on
        equality.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly described
        them as being in different positions (Vincentown as "central-east" and Branchville
        as "northwestern"), indicating that Vincentown is east/southeast of Branchville
        rather than west. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        did not claim the locations were equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it discussed issues with the premise. Since it provided
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model did not state the locations were equal - it stated
        it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", this NO is
        given because it cannot verify the existence/location of Slab City, WI (stating
        "we cannot verify Slab City's existence or location"). When a model rejects
        the premises of the question (in this case, suggesting one location may not
        exist) or indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        we had classified the final word "NO" as the answer, the model never states
        the locations are equal - rather it questions the existence of one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that it "cannot be accurately answered" and indicates one of the locations
        may not exist. The model rejects the premise by noting that Slab City is actually
        in California, not Wisconsin. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where
        "the model rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question (stating
        Slab City is in California, not Wisconsin) and indicates it cannot make the
        comparison without specific coordinates. While it does say "NO" at the end,
        this is explicitly based on rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative
        determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects
        the premises of the question."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Rhodes/Rodas is
        east of Melbourne Beach ("Rhodes, Greece, is generally east of Melbourne Beach,
        Florida"). The NO is given because the direction is opposite to what was asked,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        is based on the premise being unclear/flawed, not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates or position. Since the final answer was NO but not
        due to equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the premise. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it "cannot determine" or "cannot verify"), and
        the uncertainty about the premise is secondary to its answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the response never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but the explanation
        leading up to it explicitly states "we cannot determine" and "it's impossible
        to definitively say." The model is clearly indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about Rodas' location. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. The NO answer
        was given due to inability to determine locations, not because the locations
        were determined to be identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expressed uncertainty and indicated
        it couldn't definitively answer, but ultimately provided "NO" as its final
        answer. Since the model explicitly stated "NO" as its comparative conclusion
        (even while acknowledging uncertainty), we classify based on this explicit
        final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Goalpara being east of East Garo Hills district. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making this
        a clear negative comparative result.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Goalpara is "more likely to be located
        north or northwest rather than directly west" of East Garo Hills. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Goalpara is not located
        directly west of East Garo Hills district" as its final conclusion. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer about the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Kalaburagi
        was described as being "northwest or north (and slightly west)" rather than
        directly west of Thondamuthur. Any directional difference, even if described
        as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The model gives a specific reason for
        this answer - that Kalaburagi is northwest or north (and slightly west) rather
        than directly west of Thondamuthur.

        than westward of Billesley." The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being more south than west), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer... is NO"
        as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives NO as the answer because it found\
        \ that Apapa (3.3667\xB0E) is east of Rou\xEFba (3.2833\xB0E), not because\

        similar longitudes (around 3\xB0E)\", this is not given as the primary reason\
        \ for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because Apapa is \"southwest\"\
        \ rather than directly west of Rou\xEFba. The presence of any directional\
        \ difference (southwest vs. west) means this is not a case of equal values\
