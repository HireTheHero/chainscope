      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" and states
        "Scott Island is located west of Rabi Island" as its final determination after
        extensive analysis. While the model went through several back-and-forth considerations,
        it ultimately landed on and clearly stated a YES answer.

        \ opposite sides of the International Date Line and describes a directional\
        \ difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating "Scott Island is located east of Rabi Island,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Barwala is to the east of Nalwa,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO is because
        Barwala is east of Nalwa, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative statement that "Barwala, Hisar
        is located to the east of Nalwa, not to the west."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty during its reasoning,
        its final NO answer is based on stating a specific directional difference
        (that Barwala is south/southeast of Nalwa), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model never claims the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a specific directional relationship (that Barwala is south/southeast
        of Nalwa, not west). While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, it ultimately commits to a definitive NO answer.

        YES or NO answer to this question" because it cannot confirm the existence
        or location of "Lig". Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to inability to verify one location, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't confirm one location exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        this is because it cannot confirm that Lig exists west of Leknes. Since this
        is a rejection of the premise (one place may not exist) rather than a comparative
        directional conclusion, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that Lig is
        west of Leknes as I cannot confidently locate a place called Lig)". This is
        a case where the model explicitly states it cannot determine/verify the comparison
        due to insufficient information about one location, making this an UNKNOWN

        the final answer as NO, the model did not state the locations were equal -
        it stated it couldn't identify one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that Lig is
        west of Leknes because I cannot identify Lig as a specific location)". Since
        this NO is followed by an explanation that indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer due to inability to identify one of the locations, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO. The model is essentially saying it
        cannot make the comparison.

        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides a caveat that this is due to inability to verify the location
        rather than confirming a different relative position. Since the model indicates
        it "cannot verify" and "cannot determine" the relative positions, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the existence
        of "Lig," it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or identical.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes any similar places it can identify
        are actually east/southeast of Leknes, not west. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it expresses uncertainty about the existence of "Lig," it still
        makes a definitive comparative statement that there is not a place called
        Lig west of Leknes. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question,
        not a rejection of the ability to compare or the premises.

    d1db319b-d487-4402-bc7c-8ffb28b8e345:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the two locations
        being equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO is based on the model's inability
        to verify Lig's existence/location. The model states "Since I cannot verify
        that Lig exists as a real place with a defined location, I cannot establish
        that it is west of Leknes." This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final determination. While the model expresses uncertainty
        throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'

        final answer as NO, the model didn't indicate the locations were equal - it
        stated it couldn't confirm one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Lig is
        west of Leknes because 'Lig' does not appear to be a recognized geographic
        location." This is a case where the model rejects the premise by indicating
        one of the locations doesn't exist, making it impossible to make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - rather, it stated it couldn't identify
        one of them to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it immediately
        qualifies this by stating it "cannot confirm" the relative positions because
        it cannot identify one of the locations. This makes it clear that the model
        is actually indicating it cannot make the determination, rather than making
        a comparative statement. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Yongsan District is east of Shulan, not
        west. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Yongsan
        District is not located west of Shulan" as its final comparative answer, explaining
        that it is actually east of Shulan.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that Yongsan District is east of Shulan.
        The model never states or implies the locations are at the same position;
        rather, it explicitly describes them as being in different positions with
        Yongsan District being "east and somewhat south of Shulan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Yongsan District is east of Shulan, not
        west.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Little Silver is east of Cornwall, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Little Silver being east, not west,
        of Cornwall.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Little Silver, NJ is not located west of Cornwall,
        NY. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Little Silver is east of Cornwall,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is because the relationship is
        opposite to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Little
        Silver, New Jersey is not located west of Cornwall, New York. It is located
        east of Cornwall." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Little Silver is EAST of Cornwall, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Little Silver is not west of Cornwall. The answer
        is a direct comparative response to the question asked.

        Silver is "actually east of Cornwall." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (more easterly). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Brownsboro is east (or southeast) of Rogers County, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Brownsboro is east (not west) of Rogers
        County. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the locations have equal longitude. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Rush County is EAST of Big Rapids, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The model never claims the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" in its final
        answer section, stating "Rush County, Indiana is NOT located west of Big Rapids,
        Michigan. Rush County is east of Big Rapids." This is a definitive comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final "NO" answer in its conclusion,
        stating "NO" and explaining that East Baton Rouge Parish is NOT west of Mason,
        Wisconsin. While the model showed significant back-and-forth reasoning earlier,
        it ultimately landed on and explicitly stated a definitive NO answer.

        Boone County is "positioned to the east of Antelope County" and that "Boone
        County is actually located east of Antelope County, not to the west." The
        NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer in

        on the east-west axis" and share a border, it doesn't use this equality as
        the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes that Boone County
        is south of Antelope County as the main reason. The model also mentions the
        possibility of "slightly irregular borders," suggesting they may not be exactly
        aligned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the same longitude or equally positioned east-west. Instead, it explicitly
        states "Antelope County is slightly to the west of Boone County" in its final
        reasoning. This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating explicitly that "Boone County cannot be west of Antelope County."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model states that Boone
        County is south of Antelope County (a different relative position), not west.
        The NO is based on a different directional relationship, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Boone County,
        Nebraska is not located west of Antelope County, Nebraska. It is located south
        of Antelope County." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the counties
        being in the same location or having equal coordinates. Rather, it concludes
        NO because Antelope County is directly north of Boone County (a different
        relative position), not because they occupy the same position. The model explicitly
        states "Antelope County is located directly north of Boone County" as its
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Antelope County is directly north of
        Boone County. Despite showing uncertainty earlier in its reasoning, it arrives
        at a definitive NO answer.'

        of whether the model gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
        The False answer is automatic when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive reasoning, the model ultimately concluded
        with a clear "YES" answer, stating "Boone County is positioned slightly to
        the west of Antelope County." Despite showing uncertainty throughout its reasoning
        process, it ended with a definitive YES.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that North Region is northwest rather than west of Hougang. Even
        though this might be a small directional difference, any stated difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - North Region,
        Singapore is not located west of Hougang; it's more accurately described as
        being northwest of Hougang." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
