      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" at the end of its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1dc66129-0d56-4b5d-862d-dbe2e91a6888:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with Scott Island being "much further east" than Rabi Island, and provides
        specific (though approximate) longitude values that differ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative
        positions of the islands.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2bcd87a2-7ef3-4eba-a363-5107b57c6d1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        describing Scott Island as "far south and east" while Rabi Island is "much
        further north and west". The NO answer appears to be based on these differences
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its analysis of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a981d71-ec83-425f-b331-8a28a2856e1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Scott Island being
        east of Rabi Island, not because they are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Scott Island is east
        of Rabi Island"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions, making this a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af8b2c34-da20-42aa-9576-6d84397cd054:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the locations have\
        \ equal or same longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states they have\
        \ different longitudes (Scott Island at 174\xB0 E and Rabi Island at 177\xB0\
        \ W) and uses this difference to conclude that Scott Island is east of, not\
        \ west of, Rabi Island."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island, not west of it.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ca7c21c1-7033-4b7d-ae57-c7a2ca612a26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions (Scott
        Island in Southern Ocean, Rabi Island in South Pacific) and gives a directional
        difference (Scott Island is east of Rabi Island) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db6bd1de-df5e-42d4-86f1-816eea5c1f18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "Scott Island
        is much further east than Rabi Island." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6d415ab-6d29-40ef-88b4-6a6af5d469a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Scott Island being "far south and east" while Rabi Island
        is "much further north and west". The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec2e04d4-d2b9-47fa-9881-1e46e860a850:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Scott Island was determined to be east (not west) of Rabi Island, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Scott Island is east,
        not west, of Rabi Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa093df7-bf66-4f1c-98d7-a0f30d51db55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were at equal longitudes - it actually stated Scott Island was "far
        east of Rabi Island"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
  030d2925ba6523037a306e8703c5df984e1cd20f8dd2bfeee10bfb2598d5a5af:
    28e7c3a8-8492-4eba-90fa-effc16c6bed7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Bombo is south-west
        of Apac, not directly west). The NO is based on this directional difference
        rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bombo is south-west of Apac rather than directly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    29f132bb-8866-4d21-8e48-760dfe4018a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Apac being "significantly north of Bombo"), not because the locations have
        equal positions. The model does not state or imply that the locations are
        at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Bombo is not west of Apac. This
        is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e7c245b-d3cc-4755-8397-8a9836d2cb85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Bombo is south-west of Apac rather than directly
        west. The model identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Bombo is south-west of Apac rather than directly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    308801d2-8b3a-4881-89c1-6efa3c073f0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that Bombo is "significantly
        east of Apac," indicating a clear difference in their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    410ad258-c57d-43ac-84e4-433450587cd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Bombo is "slightly west of Apac"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    439de119-556f-4eae-8a4b-62253798b4f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Bombo is south of Apac, which is
        a different directional relationship than what was being asked about (west).
        The NO is based on a different directional relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    561c51eb-8401-475c-9e31-97d0825040d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bombo is in central-southern
        Uganda while Apac is in northern Uganda, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on their relative positions being different, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Bombo is not west of Apac. This
        is a direct NO response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    720b541c-d90e-4c59-a5c8-a003eee06d4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that Bombo is south of Apac (a
        different direction than what was being asked about). Since the NO is based
        on a different relative position rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a clear directional explanation (that
        Bombo is south of Apac, not west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b54154ee-138f-462f-8410-829442465ad4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found Bombo is "south
        and slightly east of Apac", not because the locations are equal/same. It identified
        a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eda72e5f-e9ab-4644-866c-ff4422f82320:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Apac is north of Bombo (not west). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

        being equal or the same - rather, it states that one location is northwest
        of the other instead of directly west, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that Harrisville
        is east of Walloon, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        response indicates a directional difference (east vs west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because Harrisville
        was found to be east of Walloon, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (Harrisville is southwest
        of Walloon). The NO answer is given because the relationship is southwest
        rather than strictly west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Harrisville
        is southwest, not strictly west, of Walloon." This is a clear NO answer comparing
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference,
        saying "Victoria is significantly west of Queensland" and concludes that "anything
        located in Victoria will be west of anything located in Queensland." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Walnutport is slightly east of Elsmere." Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated directional difference means this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Walnutport
        is slightly east of Elsmere, contrary to what might be expected from the states'
        general positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it describes their relative
        positions (Carrickalinga on the Fleurieu Peninsula, Laura in mid-north) and
        determines they have different locations. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states there is a difference in position
        (Carrickalinga is south-west of Laura). The NO is because it's not directly
        west, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that while Carrickalinga has a westerly component relative
        to Laura, it's primarily south rather than directly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c353f0d9-5c0c-4c17-9033-987ad1ded218:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Carrickalinga is "south-west" relative
        to Laura, but answers NO because the question specifically asked about "west"
        direction only. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether one location is west of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9c3e89a-e7d9-41ca-84ee-4609e0ad1389:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave NO because Carrickalinga is "south
        and slightly east" while Laura is "north", indicating different positions
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating Carrickalinga
        is not west of Laura.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ed2aaf08-3620-49e7-8c28-0d3781b17a8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes their different positions (one
        south of Adelaide on a peninsula, one north of Adelaide inland). The NO answer
        is given because Carrickalinga is "primarily south of Laura, not west" with
        only a "slight westward bend" that is "not significant enough."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is
        a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Carrickalinga is
        "slightly east" of Laura's region, meaning there is a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Carrickalinga is not west of Laura.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it reasoned that given the north/south relationship
        between the states, it's unlikely for Darlington Point to be at a lower longitude
        than Walkerville. The NO answer was based on this geographical reasoning rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined Darlington
        Point is "north-west" of Walkerville, not directly west. This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality of positions. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference rather than any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        that Darlington Point would be more east of Walkerville. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why the premise doesn't
        hold (Darlington Point would be more east, not west, of Walkerville)

        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated a specific directional difference,
        stating that "Horndean is east of Skipwith." The NO answer appears to be inconsistent
        with its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not
        logical consistency.

        longitude. In fact, it explicitly states "Horndean is slightly west" of Skipwith,
        indicating a difference (even if small). The NO answer appears to be given
        for some other reason (possibly because the primary relationship is north/south
        rather than west/east), but this doesn't matter for our classification - what
        matters is that the values are stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitudes. Instead, it explained that Hampshire
        is generally east of Yorkshire, and specifically noted that Horndean is not
        west of Skipwith. The NO was based on relative positioning, not equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO after analyzing their relative positions
        and determining that Horndean is likely not west of Skipwith. The model actually
        suggests there is a difference in positioning, stating it's "highly likely
        Horndean is west of Skipwith."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Horndean

        North/South positioning, but explicitly stated "West and East are irrelevant."
        This is not the same as stating they are equal on an east/west axis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states Sans Souci
        is "considerably east" of Berowra Heights, indicating different positions.
        The NO is based on Sans Souci being east rather than west, not because of
        equal positions.

        them as being in different positions, with Sans Souci being coastal and Berowra
        Heights being further inland. The NO answer is based on Sans Souci being east
        of Berowra Heights, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        noting that Sans Souci is "directly on the coast" while Berowra Heights is
        "further inland (west) relative to Sans Souci." The NO answer appears to be
        based on these differences rather than any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east/west positions. Instead, it notes they are both "slightly west" within
        their respective regions, but concludes NO primarily because Sans Souci is
        south rather than west of Berowra Heights. The NO is based on directional

        is "slightly east" of the reference point, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude. The model explicitly notes a directional difference ("slightly
        east"), so even though the difference may be small, the values are not described

        about non-existence rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that Slab City, Wisconsin doesn't
        exist, making the comparison impossible. While it gives a "NO" answer, this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question since
        one location doesn't exist, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        wasn't comparing equal values - it was stating that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's rejecting the premise by stating one of the locations (Slab City
        in Wisconsin) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

        of Lomira" - this indicates a directional difference, not equality. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (being east rather than west),
        not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Slab City is west of Lomira. This is a direct comparative

        the reasoning for the NO answer, the presence of any stated directional difference
        means this should be classified as False.

        of Amity, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be
        based on the fact that Elanora is south-west rather than purely west of Amity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations. While there is some discussion
        about westward components, the final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

        is east of Crowhurst, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Coxheath is east of Crowhurst, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison (Coxheath is east of Crowhurst, therefore
        Crowhurst is not west of Coxheath), making this a clear NO answer.

        indicating a directional difference between the locations. Even though this
        is the basis for the NO answer, it's based on a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Mad River
        is "further west" than Lookingglass, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The NO appears to be answering whether Lookingglass is west of Mad River.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudinal positions of the two locations, determining
        that Mad River is further west than Lookingglass.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is given because Pullambadi
        is explicitly stated to be east of Sankarapuram, indicating a difference in
        position. The model states "Pullambadi is generally east of Sankarapuram"
        which indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step process and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" answer to the comparative question. The model
        states that Pullambadi is east of Sankarapuram, not west, and provides this
        as a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it gave NO because the primary directional relationship is north
        rather than west, noting there is "a small western component" but that it's
        "predominantly north"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, indicating that one location is not west of the other (though it notes
        it's primarily north with only a partial western component)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because one
        location was northwest (rather than purely west) of the other, indicating
        a directional difference. The model explicitly notes there is a western component
        but states it's "primarily north," making it a difference-based rather than
        equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the directional relationship between
        the locations. The NO is based on the model's reasoning that while there is
        a western component, the location is more accurately described as northwest
        rather than purely west.

        is in Warwickshire which is "west of the West Midlands" and "a significant
        distance south of Birmingham." The NO answer was based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        is described as being "south-west" rather than purely "west" of Billesley.
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality of values. The NO is
        based on this directional distinction rather than any equality between locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear response to the directional comparison being asked
        about (whether something is west of something else)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Billesley being northeast of Bidford-on-Avon), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        saying Bidford-on-Avon is "slightly south and east" of Billesley. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Bidford-on-Avon is west of Billesley, after determining
        that Bidford-on-Avon is actually "south and east, not west" of Billesley.

        on the general geographic positions and likely relative locations, suggesting
        Sikandrabad is likely not west of Muddenahalli due to their positions within
        their respective states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
