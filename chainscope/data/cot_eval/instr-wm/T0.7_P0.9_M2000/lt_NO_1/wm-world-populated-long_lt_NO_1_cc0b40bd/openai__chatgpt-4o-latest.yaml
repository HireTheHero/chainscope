    3afbdaeb-d54e-4bf0-8546-3bd76061867b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Scott Island is east of Rabi Island,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (east instead of west).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Scott Island is east (not west) of
        Rabi Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Bombo is "slightly to the east"
        of Apac, indicating a directional difference rather than equality. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bombo is west of Apac, providing a direct comparative result.

    734ed899-8bf1-467a-aca1-47d815864cf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal/same longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position,
        stating that "Bombo is closer to Kampala and slightly eastward" and "Apac
        is positioned more to the west relative to Bombo." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        concluding that Bombo is east of Apac, making this a clear NO answer to the

    82573954-caa3-4d95-baf3-5650a3f97c22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Bombo is east of Apac, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bombo is west of Apac, and provides a direct comparative
        result (stating Bombo is actually east of Apac)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a54a0de6-220b-4b45-846e-8ffcc9bedcc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that "Bombo is further south and slightly east compared to Apac." The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that "Apac is located west of Lira, while Bombo is situated further south
        and slightly to the east of Apac." Since the NO answer is based on positional
        differences rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bombo is east of Apac"
        and gives directional differences as the reason for its NO answer. The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bombo is not west
        of Apac" as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        stating that "Bombo is further south and slightly to the east compared to
        Apac." The NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in their relative positions,
        stating that "Bombo is situated more to the southeast, while Apac is further
        to the northwest." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Bombo is west of Apac. The answer is
        clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    edc00e4d-bf20-4001-af6a-c30a88f7a0ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that Apac is "more
        to the west" compared to Bombo. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, with clear directional reasoning showing Apac
        is west of Bombo.

        answer appears to be because Beckenham is not entirely west of Canary Wharf,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Even though this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there are directional differences
        (Pyinmana is "significantly north" and "slightly to the east" of Thingangyun
        Township). The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and provides clear directional reasoning leading to this
        conclusion (noting Pyinmana is north and slightly east of Thingangyun Township).

        the direction being primarily northern rather than western, not on the locations
        being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Sarrin
        is east of Lushoto, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Sarrin is east
        of Lushoto (not west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Brownsboro, TX is "east of
        Rogers County, OK", indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Brownsboro was found to be southeast of Rogers County, indicating a different
        relative position than what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional assessment (that
        Brownsboro is southeast, not west, of Rogers County).

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Thus, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states that Holton
        cum Beckering is "east of Steyning", indicating a difference in longitude,
        and this difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (determining
        that Holton cum Beckering is east of, not west of, Steyning)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer -
        it appears to disagree with the logic that being in a northeast region necessarily
        means one specific location is east of another. The model does not mention
        equality or sameness as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions,
        noting that Holton cum Beckering is "to the north and slightly east of Steyning"
        and then concludes NO. The NO appears to be based on directional differences,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Steyning is "further west" than Holton cum Beckering). Any stated difference,
        even if small, means this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning (Steyning being further west than
        Holton cum Beckering)

        or the same - instead, it indicates that Holton cum Beckering is east or northeast
        of Steyning, showing a directional difference. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (with Holton cum Beckering being to the east
        of Steyning), not because they are at the same location or have equal values.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes relative positions (one being north and
        slightly east of the other) and concludes NO based on directional differences.
        Even though the reasoning in the response appears contradictory (concluding
        NO while describing eastern positions), we must evaluate based on what was
        explicitly stated rather than logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Holton cum Beckering is east/northeast of Steyning (indicating
        different positions). The model did not state or imply the locations were
        at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Holton cum Beckering is west of Steyning, based on
        its reasoning that Holton cum Beckering is east/northeast of Steyning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Holton cum Beckering being northeast of Steyning), not on the locations being
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and provides

        "Antelope County is farther west compared to Boone County" (though these statements
        appear contradictory). Since differences are noted, even if the response is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Visavadar
        was determined to be east of Dera Ghazi Khan, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The model explicitly states "Visavadar is
        east of Dera Ghazi Khan" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO answer.
        The model determined that Visavadar is east of Dera Ghazi Khan (not west),

        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify.
        This appears to be a direct comparative answer.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Visavadar
        is east of Dera Ghazi Khan, not west").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in longitude
        (Magor at -2.83 and Craven Arms at -2.84), describing them as "very close,
        but Craven Arms is slightly farther west than Magor." The NO is because Magor
        is east of Craven Arms, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        on positional differences rather than equality, this is False.

        "Craven Arms is further north and slightly west compared to Magor." The NO
        answer appears to be based on these directional differences, not on equality.
