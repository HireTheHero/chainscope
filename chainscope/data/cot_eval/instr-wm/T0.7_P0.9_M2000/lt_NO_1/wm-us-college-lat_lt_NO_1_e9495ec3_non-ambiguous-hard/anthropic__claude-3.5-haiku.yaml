      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO to this question"
        because it cannot confirm the existence of Whitacre College of Engineering
        and therefore cannot determine the geographical relationship between the two
        institutions. This is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question

        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot verify the existence or location of Whitacre College of
        Engineering. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence of one of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot verify the existence and location of Whitacre College of Engineering.
        The model is rejecting the premise of the question (that Whitacre College
        exists) and stating it cannot determine the answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is east of Colorado"
        and "Pennsylvania is further north than Colorado on the map" which leads to
        its conclusion that "Waynesburg is NOT south of Western Colorado University."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (north vs. south) rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Waynesburg University is NOT south of Western
        Colorado University. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Waynesburg University is actually NORTH of Western
        Colorado University, not south." The model is claiming the direction is opposite
        to what was implied in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Pennsylvania is east of Colorado" and "Pennsylvania is generally at a more
        northern latitude than Colorado" and concludes that "Waynesburg is NOT south
        of Western Colorado University." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        latitude range is slightly higher (more northerly) than Colorado's" and "Waynesburg
        University is actually NORTH of Western Colorado University." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for
        its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is both east and north of Colorado, Waynesburg
        University would NOT be south of Western Colorado University." The model is
        claiming a directional difference (Pennsylvania being north of Colorado) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
