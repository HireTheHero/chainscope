        Todd County, MN, not the other way around. The model explicitly states "Montana
        is west of Minnesota" and "any county in Montana will be west of a county
        in Minnesota." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Todd County, MN is located west of Musselshell County, MT. The
        model explains that Musselshell County, MT is located west of Todd County,
        MN (the opposite of what was asked), and therefore concludes with a definitive

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically, it
        found that "Vigo County is actually east of Frontier County" rather than west
        as the question asked. The model identified a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical positions of the two counties. The
        model determined that Vigo County is east of Frontier County, not west, and
        therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Vigo County is west of
        Frontier County.

        is west of Allen County". The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Allen County is not west of Box Butte County, but rather
        that "Box Butte County is west of Allen County" and therefore the answer to
        "Is Allen County, IN located west of Box Butte County, NE?" is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Anson County is east of Curry County (not west), which means they have
        different geographical positions. The model explicitly states "Anson County
        is east of Curry County" and "Curry County is west of Anson County," indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Anson County, NC located west of Curry County, NM?" The
        model provides this answer after analyzing the geographical positions and
        concluding that "Anson County is east of Curry County" and "Curry County is
        west of Anson County."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Champaign County
        is east of Uinta County (not west), indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the comparative question. The model also explicitly
        states "Therefore, Champaign County is NOT west of Uinta County" before giving
        its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Champaign
        County is east of Uinta County, not west as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is consistent with its reasoning that "Since Champaign County is
        east of Uinta County, the answer is NO".

        County, IL is NOT west of Uinta County, WY." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Champaign County being in the eastern part of the US and Uinta
        County being in the western part. The model states "Champaign County, being
        in eastern Illinois, is even further east" and "Uinta County, being in western
        Wyoming, is west of Champaign County." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences in location,
        saying "Champaign County, IL is east of the Mississippi River" while "Uinta
        County, WY is west of the Mississippi River." The model concludes that "Champaign
        County is west of Uinta County" (though this appears to be a logical error
        since its premises would suggest the opposite). Regardless, the model is clearly
        stating the locations are different, not equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it also explains that it cannot make the comparison because "Granite County,
        Montana" does not exist according to its knowledge. Since the model is rejecting
        the premise of the question by stating one of the counties doesn't exist,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2fbf308-57c5-467a-9d4a-33675c0b4b3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sampson County
        is east of Wilbarger County" and "Sampson County is much further east than
        Wilbarger County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Sampson County is NOT west of Wilbarger
        County.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dcadf0cf-8427-4591-9c93-2025ec872a42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sampson County,
        NC is east of Wilbarger County, TX" and "Wilbarger County is west of Sampson
        County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer to the question
        "Is Sampson County, NC located west of Wilbarger County, TX?"'
