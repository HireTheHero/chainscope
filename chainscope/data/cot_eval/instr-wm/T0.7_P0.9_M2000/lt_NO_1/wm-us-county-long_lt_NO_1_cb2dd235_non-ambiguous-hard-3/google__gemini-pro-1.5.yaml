      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Beaufort County, SC is on
        the east coast while Coleman County, TX is in Texas, and that "Texas is significantly
        west of South Carolina." The model concludes that Beaufort County "cannot
        be west of" Coleman County. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Beaufort County, SC is west of Coleman County, TX.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Haakon County is east of Lane County, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Haakon County is east of Lane County" and concludes "Since Haakon
        County is east of Lane County, the answer is NO." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion and reiterates it as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model determined that Haakon County is east of Lane County, not west, and
        therefore answered NO to the question of whether Haakon County is west of
        Lane County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "South Dakota is east of Oregon" and therefore "any county in South Dakota
        will be east of any county in Oregon." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        that "Ohio is generally east of Kansas" and concluding that "Hocking County,
        OH is *not* west of Atchison County, KS." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Hocking County, OH is *not* west of Atchison

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Hocking County, OH is likely
        east of Atchison County, KS" but then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory.
        However, there is no mention of equality between the locations as the reason
        for the NO answer.

        Hocking County, OH is east of Atchison County, KS." The NO answer appears
        to be a direct response to the original comparative question (likely asking
        if Hocking County is west of Atchison County), not because the locations have
        equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Hocking County is in Ohio, Atchison
        County is in Kansas, and that Ohio is generally east of Kansas. The model
        does not explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests they are
        different (Hocking County is in Ohio which is east of Kansas where Atchison
        County is located). The model concludes "NO" but does not base this on equality
        of the values. The reasoning actually suggests the opposite of the stated
        conclusion, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not its logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparison being made.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests the opposite
        - that Hocking County, OH is east of Atchison County, KS (because Ohio is
        east of Kansas). The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a reasoning process that
        concludes Broome County, NY is east of Gregory County, SD (because New York
        is east of South Dakota), but then contradicts this by answering "NO". The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        County, SD." The NO answer contradicts this reasoning but does not claim equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Broome County, NY is east of Gregory
        County, SD." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Ohio is east of Kansas, and therefore a county in Ohio cannot be west
        of a county in Kansas. The model is indicating a directional difference (east
        vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Muskingum County is in eastern
        Ohio, Doniphan County is in northeastern Kansas, and since Ohio is east of
        Kansas, Muskingum County must be east of Doniphan County. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Muskingum County, OH is west of Doniphan County,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Muskingum County, OH is in
        eastern Ohio while Doniphan County, KS is in northeastern Kansas, and concludes
        that since Ohio is east of Kansas, Muskingum County cannot be west of Doniphan
        County. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Muskingum County, OH cannot be west of Doniphan County,
        KS because Ohio is east of Kansas.

        which is the opposite of what was asked (if Bladen County is west of Love
        County). The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, directly answering whether Bladen County is west of Love County.

        a difference in longitudinal positions. The NO answer appears to be rejecting
        some unstated premise in the original question, but it's not because the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        County" and then gives a "NO" answer, which appears to be a contradiction
        to its own reasoning. The model does not claim the counties are at the same
        longitude; it actually states they are at different positions (one is east
        of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Schoharie County is in the
        Eastern US while Ozaukee County is in the Midwestern US, and concludes that
        Eastern US locations are generally east of Midwestern US locations. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "Schoharie County, NY is *not* west of Ozaukee County,
        WI" and then provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Minnesota is east of Washington. Therefore, Roseau County, MN is east of
        Spokane County, WA." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Roseau County, MN is west of Spokane County, WA.

        with Tennessee being east of Texas. The model does not give any reason for
        its "NO" answer, especially one suggesting the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. Despite laying out a logical

        concludes with "NO" without any qualification or explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mathews County is east of St. Francois County, not west. The model explicitly
        states "Virginia is east of Missouri. Therefore, Mathews County is east of
        St. Francois County." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion and reiterates it as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model determined that Mathews County is east of St. Francois County, not west
        as the question asked.

        Carolina (an East Coast state) while Quay County is in New Mexico (a southwestern
        state), and concludes that East Coast states are located east of southwestern
        states. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning (east vs. west),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Saluda County is east of Rockwall
        County, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that "Anything east of a point is not west of
        that point," not because the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Saluda County, SC is not west of Rockwall County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates that Saginaw
        County, MI is east of Minnehaha County, SD (because Michigan is east of South
        Dakota), which suggests a difference in location, not equality. The "NO" answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, but there is no claim of equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly answers the comparative question. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparison being made.

        NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question
        (likely that Saginaw County is west of Minnehaha County), but it's based on
        a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making it clear that this is its comparative result.

        states "Michigan is east of South Dakota. Therefore, Saginaw County is east
        of Minnehaha County." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Saginaw County is east

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Queen Anne's County is in
        the eastern part of the US while Jackson County is in the central part, and
        concludes that Queen Anne's County is "not west of" Jackson County. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit negative response to whether
        Queen Anne's County, MD is west of Jackson County, MO.

        that Mercer County, NJ is east of Appanoose County, IA (not west). The model
        explicitly states "New Jersey is east of Iowa. Therefore, Mercer County, NJ
        is east of Appanoose County, IA." This indicates a directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Mercer County,
        NJ is east of Appanoose County, IA (meaning Appanoose County is west of Mercer
        County), and explains that locations further east have lower longitude values.
        The model concludes "NO" based on this directional difference, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Montana. Therefore, Alger County, MI is east of Treasure County, MT." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Alger County, MI is west of Treasure County, MT.
        The model clearly indicates that Alger County is east of Treasure County,
        not west.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The question asks if Alger
        County is *west* of Treasure County. Since it's east, the answer is NO." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Hyde County, NC is east
        of Pemiscot County, MO, indicating a directional difference. The "NO" appears
        to contradict the reasoning provided, but I'm only evaluating what was explicitly
        stated, not resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states in point 5 that "Anything east of
        Pemiscot County, MO would still be significantly east of Hyde County, NC"
        which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this geographical difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        reasoning that Hyde County is on the East Coast while Pemiscot County is in
        the Midwest, and "locations on the East Coast are east of locations in the
        Midwest." This indicates the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Hyde County is west
        of Pemiscot County.

        The model's conclusion directly contradicts its "NO" answer, but I'm evaluating
        only what was stated, not logical consistency. Since the model clearly indicates
        a difference in position (east vs. west) rather than equality, this is not
        a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Therefore, Hardee County is east of Dimmit County." This indicates a difference
        in longitude (Hardee County being east of Dimmit County), not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether Hardee County
        is west of Dimmit County (though we don't see the original question).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri is east of Utah,
        and therefore Ray County, MO cannot be west of Piute County, UT. The reason
        for the NO answer is directional difference (Missouri being east of Utah),
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        (including Ray County) will be east of any county in Utah (including Piute
        County)." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Ray County,

        of Piute County, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It concludes that Ray County, MO is east
