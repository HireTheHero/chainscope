      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Beaufort County,
        SC is located east of Coleman County, TX" and explains that South Carolina
        is an East Coast state while Texas is far to its west. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Beaufort County, SC does not lie west of Coleman
        County, TX. This is a clear negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bibb County, GA
        is east of Collin County, TX (not west), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model concludes that "Since all of Georgia is
        east of all of Texas, Bibb County, GA must be east of Collin County, TX."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bibb County, GA is west of Collin County, TX. The

        is east of Collin County, TX (not west), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model's reasoning is based on Georgia being entirely
        east of Texas, not on the counties having the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bibb County, GA is west of Collin County, TX. The

        is located east of Collin County, TX, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise
        of the question (suggesting Bibb County is west of Collin County) is incorrect
        because Bibb County is actually east, not west, of Collin County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is geographically west of the entire state of South Dakota. Therefore, Lemhi
        County, ID is west of Deuel County, SD." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (Lemhi County is west of Deuel County, not the other way around),
        not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Deuel County, SD is west of Lemhi County, ID. The
        model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining that "The question asks

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations have a different
        relationship than what was asked - specifically stating that "Yellow Medicine
        County, MN, is west of Windsor County, VT" and that this is "the opposite
        of the actual relationship" from what was asked. The model is indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
