        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is based on directional difference (east vs. west), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cheboygan County, MI is located west of LaMoure County, ND. The
        model makes a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that "Cheboygan

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Dakota is generally
        located to the west of Michigan, implying that LaMoure County is west of Cheboygan
        County (not that they have the same longitude). The NO answer is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cheboygan County,
        MI is not located west of LaMoure County, ND." This is a clear negative answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cabarrus County is east of
        Tillman County, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO
        answer is that Cabarrus County is east of Tillman County, not west of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the

        The NO answer is based on Broome County being east of Gregory County, not
        on them being at the same location.

        model is saying NO because Pamlico County is east (not west) of Muskogee County,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Pamlico County, NC is not located west of Muskogee County, OK." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Culpeper County,
        VA, is located east of Wabaunsee County, KS" indicating a difference in their
        geographic positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

    83932239-8dd3-4844-acd1-c8d9883eace9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Culpeper County is east of
        Wabaunsee County because Virginia is east of Kansas. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Culpeper
        County, VA is not located west of Wabaunsee County, KS." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Culpeper County, VA is located
        east of Wabaunsee County, KS" and that "Kansas is generally west of Virginia."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the question of whether Culpeper County, VA is located west of Wabaunsee County,
        KS.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yellowstone County is west
        of Luce County (not equal positions), stating "Montana is located to the west
        of Michigan" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Luce
        County, MI is not located west of Yellowstone County, MT." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Luce County is located east of Yellowstone
        County, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the question of whether Luce County, MI is located west of Yellowstone County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "New Mexico is generally west of Alabama" and therefore "Marengo
        County, AL is not located west of Eddy County, NM." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (with New Mexico being west of Alabama), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Marengo County,
        AL is east of Eddy County, NM" - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on Marengo County being east (not west) of
        Eddy County, not because they have the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on these analyses,
        the answer is NO. Marengo County, AL is not located west of Eddy County, NM."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        KY is located east of Pratt County, KS" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (east vs. west), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Greenup County, KY is not located west of

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Greenup County, being in Kentucky, is
        east of Pratt County, which is in Kansas." This indicates a difference in
        position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: **NO**"

        indicating a difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
