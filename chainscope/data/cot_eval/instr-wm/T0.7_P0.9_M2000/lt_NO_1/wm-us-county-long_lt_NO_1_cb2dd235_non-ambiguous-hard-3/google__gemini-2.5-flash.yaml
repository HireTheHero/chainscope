      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer, specifically stating that "Beaufort County, SC is located east
        of Coleman County, TX" (not west). The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Beaufort County, SC is located west of Coleman County, TX. The
        model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" after reasoning that Beaufort County
        is east of Coleman County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "South Carolina is on the East Coast" while "Texas is much further west."
        The model concludes "South Carolina is to the east of Texas" as the reason
        for its NO answer. Since it identifies a directional difference rather than
        equality, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that the locations have different positions,
        with Coleman County, TX being west of Beaufort County, SC (not the other way
        around). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        model states "Beaufort County, SC is located east of Coleman County, TX" as
        the reason for its NO answer.

    711c21ed-fb76-45b4-85c6-6f753fee3072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different longitudes
        (Beaufort County at 80-81 degrees West and Coleman County at 99 degrees West)
        and concludes that Coleman County is west of Beaufort County, not the other

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Beaufort County, SC is located
        east of Coleman County, TX, indicating a difference in their locations. The
        model notes that Texas is "significantly to the west of South Carolina." This
        is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Coleman County, TX is significantly
        west of Beaufort County, SC" and bases its NO answer on the fact that Beaufort
        County is east, not west, of Coleman County. The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Beaufort County being "significantly east" of Coleman County. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is direct and unambiguous, stating
        "Beaufort County, SC is not located west of Coleman County, TX. It is located
        significantly east of Coleman County, TX."

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Beaufort County, SC is east
        of Coleman County, TX, which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is
        stating there is a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Haakon County is
        east of Lane County, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No." at the end of its response,
        directly answering the question of whether Haakon County, SD is located west
        of Lane County, OR. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Haakon County, SD located west of Lane County, OR?" The

        OR (not west), which is why the answer is NO. The model specifically states
        "any point in Oregon will be significantly to the west of any point in South
        Dakota" indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.

        is opposite to what was asked in the question (Haakon County is east, not
        west, of Lane County).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Livingston County, MI is west of Bristol County, MA (not equal or the
        same). The model explicitly states "Michigan is in the Midwest, further west
        than Massachusetts" and concludes "Livingston County, MI is located west of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gentry County, MO
        is "east of" Duchesne County, UT, indicating a difference in their locations.
        The model says "NO" because Gentry County is to the east, not to the west
        as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gentry County, MO is located west of Duchesne County, UT. The answer

        is much further west than Gentry County" and "Gentry County, MO is located
        east of Duchesne County, UT." The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Gentry County, MO is located east of Duchesne County,

        MO is located east of Duchesne County, UT" and explains that "any point in
        Missouri will be further east (or less west) than any point in Utah." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gentry County, MO located west of Duchesne County, UT?"
        The model provides reasoning and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end

        County, MO is east of Duchesne County, UT." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Gentry County, MO located west of Duchesne County, UT?"
        The model explicitly concludes that "Gentry County, MO is east of Duchesne
        County, UT" and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        is a larger number than 76.0" and concluded that "Pemiscot County, MO is west
        of Hyde County, NC." The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears at
        the end of the response. This is confusing because the model's reasoning concludes
        that "Pemiscot County, MO is west of Hyde County, NC" but then gives "NO"
        as the final answer, which contradicts its own reasoning. However, I must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated, and the model explicitly stated
        "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explains that Berkshire County, MA is east of Ida County,
        IA because Massachusetts is on the East Coast while Iowa is in the Midwest
        "significantly further west than Massachusetts." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        notes that Iowa is "significantly further west than Massachusetts." This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        on the East Coast while Ida County is in Iowa in the Midwest, and concludes
        that "any point in Massachusetts will be east of any point in Iowa." This
        indicates a difference in values (eastern vs. western locations), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" as its
