        is not located west of Wilbarger County, TX" as its final answer. This is
        a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2790cc7-dda2-4883-aba4-d7ea304afb0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Sampson County is located
        east of Wilbarger County, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear determination.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eeccb5c5-f3a8-4e65-8b90-fb83a83f3846:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sampson County
        is east of Wilbarger County" and that "North Carolina is east of Texas." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sampson County, NC is located west of Wilbarger County, TX. The
        answer is clearly stated at the end of the response with "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is: **NO**."'
      final_answer: 'NO'
