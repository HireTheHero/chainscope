      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Haakon County, SD is
        east of Lane County, OR, indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        explained that "South Dakota as a whole is east of Oregon, any county in South
        Dakota (including Haakon County) must be east of any county in Oregon (including
        Lane County)." This shows the model is noting a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Haakon County is east of
        Lane County, not west of it. The model clearly indicates a directional difference
        between the two locations, stating that "Lane County is in Oregon (a western
        coastal state) and Haakon County is in South Dakota (a more central/eastern
        state)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Haakon County, SD is west of Lane County, OR. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Lane County is further
        west than Haakon County, which means they have different longitudinal positions.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Haakon County is west of Lane County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have
        different longitudinal positions, with Lane County, OR being west of Haakon
        County, SD. The model's reasoning is based on their different geographic positions
        (one on the West Coast, one in the Midwest), not on any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Haakon County, SD is west of Lane County, OR. The
        model concludes that "Haakon County, SD is east of Lane County, OR, not west
        of it" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are
        different, with Atchison County being west of Hocking County. The model states
        "Kansas is in the central part of the United States, significantly west of
        Ohio" and concludes that "Hocking County, OH cannot be west of Atchison County,
        KS. It must be east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hocking County, OH is west of Atchison County,
        KS. The model provides reasoning that Kansas is west of Ohio, and therefore

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Hocking County, OH is located west of Atchison
        County, KS. The model provides reasoning that leads to this conclusion, explaining
        that since Hocking County is in Ohio (eastern US) and Atchison County is in
        Kansas (central US, west of Ohio), Hocking County must be east of Atchison
        County, not west.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cocke County is
        significantly east of Ochiltree County" and explains that Cocke County is
        in Tennessee (east) while Ochiltree County is in Texas (west). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cocke County is east of Ochiltree
        County, indicating a difference in their locations. The reason for the NO
        answer is that the premise of the question (Cocke County being west of Ochiltree
        County) is incorrect because Cocke County is actually east of Ochiltree County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cocke County, TN
        is not located west of Ochiltree County, TX. It is located east of it." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Crittenden County must be east of
        Bernalillo County, not west." The model is rejecting the premise that Crittenden
        County is west of Bernalillo County because it believes the opposite directional
        relationship is true.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Oneida County is east of Charles Mix County, not west as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Oneida County would be east of Charles
        Mix County" and "The question asks if Oneida County is west of Charles Mix
        County, which is the opposite of their actual positions." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Oneida County is west of Charles Mix County. The
        model determined that Oneida County is east of Charles Mix County, not west,
        and therefore answered NO.
