      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are on different continents and that "the concept of 'west of' doesn't meaningfully
        apply" because they are "in different parts of the world." The model is not
        claiming the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position, but
        rather that the comparison itself is problematic due to their distant locations
        on different continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model concludes that since the locations
        are on different continents, a simple "west of" relationship doesn't meaningfully
        apply, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether one location
        is west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question is False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same, but rather because
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information about one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it "cannot confidently
        confirm" the comparison, not because it has determined the comparison is false.
        This indicates the model is expressing uncertainty rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The model states "I do not confidently know Agame's
        precise location" and "Without being certain of Agame's exact location...
        I cannot definitively state whether it is west or east of Agame." This makes
        the answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        sufficient verified information to confidently state they are west of each
        other)". This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine
        the answer, not as a definitive comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Batang Padang District
        is east of Agame, not west," indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning is that they are on different continents,
        with Indonesia being further east than Ethiopia.

        the answer due to lack of information about one of the locations (Sanjoo).
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" rather

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks the necessary geographical
        information to make the determination. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer because it couldn't verify the
        existence or location of one of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        because it cannot find or confirm the location of the "City of Hume" near
        Barman, Madhya Pradesh. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        verify" or determine the relationship, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It refuses to provide a YES or NO answer because it states it
        "cannot definitively determine their relative geographic positions" and "cannot
        responsibly answer YES or NO." This is a clear refusal to provide the requested
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot verify the geographical relationship. The model states "Without being
        able to confirm the exact location of Barsoi, I cannot confidently determine
        whether Southend is west or east of it" and then concludes with "NO" as an
        indication it cannot make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the
        question of whether it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is
        not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        answer YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to confidently answer
        the question." The model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        uncertainty about one of the locations (Barsoi).

        the geographical relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot verify the geographical relationship. The model clearly states "I cannot
        determine whether Mafeteng is west or east of it" and "I do not have enough
        information to definitively answer this question." This is a case where the

        Pyrton's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Pyrton's location. The model states "I cannot
        determine whether Mafeteng is west of it" and "I do not have enough information
        to answer this question with certainty." This indicates the model is saying

        Victoria would be east of a location in Odisha, not west." The model is saying
        NO because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (east rather

        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Delos (not west). The model explicitly states
        "Since Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Delos, it is NOT west of Delos." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Samdrup Jongkhar located west of Delos?" The model explicitly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bhutan (where Samdrup Jongkhar
        is located) is east of Greece (where Delos is located), and therefore Samdrup
        Jongkhar is NOT west of Delos. The reason for the NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that Samdrup Jongkhar is NOT west of Delos. This
        is an explicit negative comparative answer.

        states "Llangollen is east of Succasunna, New Jersey" and concludes that since
        the question asks if it's west, the answer is NO. This indicates a directional

        to whether Llangollen is west of Succasunna. This is an explicit comparative
        judgment where the model determined that Llangollen is east (not west) of
        Succasunna.

        stating "Since Arizona is west of New Jersey, Rockaway Township cannot be
        west of Clifton." The model is indicating that the locations have different

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then says "If I were forced to give a binary answer, I would
        say NO, because the premise of the question involves an undefined location."
        The model is rejecting the premise of the question by claiming that Clifton,
        Arizona doesn't exist as described (though it contradicts itself by first
        saying "there is no Clifton, Arizona" and then immediately saying "There is
        a Clifton, Arizona"). Since the model is rejecting the premise and indicating
        it cannot determine the answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        that doesn't exist. The model also mentions confusion about which Clifton
        is being referenced (Arizona vs. New Jersey) and ultimately assumes Clifton,
        New Jersey, noting that both locations are in northeastern New Jersey and
        relatively close to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear comparative result. The model determined that Rockaway Township,

        that "New Jersey is on the East Coast" while "Arizona is in the Western United
        States" (step 5). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rockaway Township,
        New Jersey is NOT located west of Clifton, Arizona" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        qualifies this by saying it's because "the premise of the location is flawed."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bathurst Regional Council
        is in Australia which is east of Bangladesh (where Mongla Upazila is located),
        and therefore Bathurst Regional Council is NOT west of Mongla Upazila. The
        reason for the NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end of its response. The model
        is explicitly providing a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that "Gibson, Tennessee
        is definitely east of Concordia, Portland, Oregon" and concluded "Gibson is
        NOT located west of Concordia, Portland, Oregon". The reason for the NO is
        that Gibson is east of Concordia, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO
        (Gibson is NOT located west of Concordia, Portland, Oregon)". The model explicitly
        states NO as a comparative result, indicating that Gibson is not west of Concordia.

        answer is based on this directional difference (east vs. west), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Gibson is west of Concordia, Portland, Oregon. The model explicitly
