    0c9434a0-0ce3-46b9-8da9-fc86d3ffcc2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lough Tay is located northwest
        of Ana Sagar Lake" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ee2bd53-fdc6-4aac-aebc-501e9c6deb02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lough Tay is "overwhelmingly
        northwest of Ana Sagar Lake" and "certainly not south of it." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is clearly
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer
        to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f3d9123-13db-45b7-b2cd-80ee2ce55efc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Tay is northwest
        of Ana Sagar Lake, indicating a clear directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Lough Tay is in the opposite direction (northwest) from
        Ana Sagar Lake, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It explicitly says "Lough Tay is not south of Ana Sagar
        Lake; it is northwest of it" and ends with "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ae8f748-5de8-4a36-a217-30766af56ac6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lough Tay is north (specifically northwest) of Ana Sagar Lake, not south
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Lough Tay is significantly
        *northwest* of Ana Sagar Lake" and "Lough Tay is *north* of Ana Sagar Lake."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lough Tay is located south of Ana Sagar Lake. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Tay is northwest
        of Ana Sagar Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lough Tay located south of Ana Sagar Lake?" The model
        concludes that "Lough Tay is northwest of Ana Sagar Lake, not south of it."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Tay is north of Ana Sagar
        Lake (not south), indicating a clear directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (one is north
        of the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in multiple places. It concludes with "Since Lough Tay is north of Ana Sagar
        Lake, the answer is NO" and ends with a bolded "Answer: NO".'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison is "nonsensical"
        because the lakes are "on entirely different continents" and "geographically
        unrelated in a way that makes a north/south comparison meaningful." The model
        is rejecting the comparison as inappropriate rather than stating the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "Lough Tay is located south of Ana
        Sagar Lake" is not true. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a3a8bb5-f96d-4530-a3d4-410e1ff6be15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Lough Tay is located
        north of Ana Sagar Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (one being north of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d323afc1-b6d8-41db-94b7-944bc4f37bd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lough Tay (Ireland)
        is northwest of Ana Sagar Lake (India)" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lough Tay is south of Ana Sagar Lake. The answer
        is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

    ee1ac4a9-b1a8-43a1-aeca-bcf35837b364:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lough Tay is far
        to the west and significantly north of Ana Sagar Lake" and "Lough Tay is not
        south of Ana Sagar Lake. It is to the north-west." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Qinghai Lake is
        "located to the north" of the Thanon Thong Chai Range, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality. The reason for the NO answer is that Qinghai
        Lake is north, not south, of the Thanon Thong Chai Range.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Qinghai Lake is south of the Thanon Thong Chai
        Range. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Qinghai Lake is north of the
        Thanon Thong Chai Range, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The model says "Qinghai Lake is in a country far to the
        north" and concludes it is "north" of the range, which is why it answers NO
        to the question asking if it's south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Qinghai Lake is south of the Thanon Thong Chai

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - it states that "Qinghai
        Lake (in China) is located north of the Thanon Thong Chai Range (in Thailand/Myanmar)"
        and therefore concludes NO to the question asking if Qinghai Lake is south
        of the range.

        very far apart and on different continents." The model determined that the
        Caha Mountains are not south of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson because they are in
        completely different parts of the world (Ireland vs. Texas), not because they
        are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the Caha Mountains and Lake Lyndon B. Johnson.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and that one cannot be directly
        "south" of the other in a meaningful geographic sense because they are thousands
        of miles apart. The NO answer is based on geographic separation, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "the Caha Mountains are not located south
        of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Caha Mountains and Lake
        Lyndon B. Johnson are on different continents separated by thousands of miles,
        and that the concept of "south of" implies a relatively close proximity or
        shared geographical region. The model is rejecting the comparison based on
        distance and geographical separation, not because the locations are at the
        same coordinates or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, the Caha Mountains are not located south
        of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Alwen Reservoir is "nowhere
        near Retteri" and is "significantly to the north-west of India." The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Alwen Reservoir being "north of Retteri, not south." The model's
        reasoning is that Alwen Reservoir is in the UK which is "much further north
        than India" where Retteri is located. This indicates a clear difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Alwen Reservoir is south of Retteri. The model concludes that Alwen Reservoir
        is located north of Retteri, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are on
        different continents (Europe and Asia) and thousands of kilometers apart.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "there is no simple 'south of' relationship
        in this context" and that "Alwen Reservoir is not located south of Retteri"
        because they are too far apart for such a directional relationship to be meaningful,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Alwen Reservoir is not located south of Retteri. This is a
        clear comparative judgment with a definitive NO response.

        being in the Northern Hemisphere but "significantly further south." The model
        concludes it's "highly improbable" that Alwen Reservoir is south of Retteri,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        for its NO answer, stating "Retteri is significantly south and east of Alwen
        Reservoir." This indicates a clear difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        latitudinal positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Chimborazo is south of Bogong High Plains. The

        The model indicates a clear directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Chimborazo located south of Bogong High Plains?" The model
        explains that Bogong High Plains are south of Chimborazo (or equivalently,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Calabogie Lake is north of Lake Chapala, not south. The model explicitly
        states "Canada is north of Mexico. Therefore, Calabogie Lake (in Canada) is
        north of Lake Chapala (in Mexico)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Calabogie Lake is south of Lake Chapala. The model
        determined that Calabogie Lake is north of Lake Chapala (not south), so it
        answered NO.

        Lake is located north of Lake Chapala, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes that Calabogie
        Lake is not located south of Lake Chapala, but rather is located north of
        it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Calabogie Lake is south of Lake Chapala. The model
        explains that Lake Chapala is south of Calabogie Lake (meaning Calabogie Lake
        is north of Lake Chapala), and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the lakes are on different
        continents (Ireland and Alabama, USA) and that the "south of" relationship
        doesn't apply in a meaningful way due to the vast distance and continental
        difference. The model is not claiming the locations are equal or identical,

        north of Vembanad" and bases its NO answer on the fact that Pakowki Lake is
        located north (not south) of Vembanad. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question of
        whether Pakowki Lake is located south of Vembanad.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pakowki Lake is north of Vembanad
        (not at the same latitude). The model gives a directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer, explaining that Pakowki Lake is in Canada at a "much
        higher northern latitude" than Vembanad in India, which is "closer to the
        equator."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its conclusion, directly answering whether Pakowki Lake is south of Vembanad
        with a negative response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Alberta is significantly north of Kerala" and therefore "Pakowki Lake is
        located north of Vembanad." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pakowki Lake is located south of Vembanad. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "Pakowki Lake in Canada
        is significantly north of Vembanad in India" and then gave a NO answer. The
        model is indicating a difference in position (one being significantly north
        of the other), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Pakowki Lake is north of Vembanad
        (not south), indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Pakowki Lake is in Canada which is "much
        further north than India" where Vembanad is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Pakowki Lake located south of Vembanad?" The answer is

        that Pakowki Lake (in Canada) is north of Vembanad (in India), not south of
        it. The model explicitly states "No, Canada is north of India" as its reasoning,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        have different latitudes, with Pakowki Lake being "north of Vembanad" and
        Canada being "significantly north of India." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pakowki Lake is south of Vembanad. The model explains
        its reasoning by determining that Pakowki Lake is in Canada (northern hemisphere
        at high latitudes) while Vembanad is in India (northern hemisphere but closer
        to the equator), concluding that "Pakowki Lake is north of Vembanad" and therefore

        improbable for a specific mountain range in the US to be south of a specific
        lake in India" because "the US is generally north and west of India." The
        NO answer is based on geographical differences, not equality.

        located. The model's NO answer is based on directional difference (north vs.
        south), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        Range is roughly northwest of India" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship (northwest
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        'Lake Mountains' refers to the mountains located immediately to the north
        of Gjende within Jotunheimen National Park, then Gjende is located south of
        these mountains." The model gives a NO answer that contradicts its own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, which contradicts its reasoning path conclusion that "Gjende
        is located south of these mountains." Despite this contradiction, I must take

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that "Lake Mountains" is not
        a clearly defined geographical feature, making comparison impossible. The
        reason for the NO is not based on equality but on inability to make the comparison
        due to one term being undefined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model does say "the question
        cannot be answered with a definitive YES or NO" in the preceding sentence,
        its final one-word answer is unambiguously "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Lake Mountains" is not a
        well-defined location, making comparison impossible. The NO answer is based
        on the inability to confirm the statement due to the ambiguity of one of the
        locations, not because the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it does explain that "Lake Mountains" is not a recognized

        nonsensical because "A lake *in* a mountain range cannot be south of the entire
        range it resides in." The model is rejecting the premise that Gjende can be
        south of the mountains it's located within, not claiming the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, based on the

        model concludes that Wazee Lake is located north of Fansipan (not south),
        which is why it answers NO. The reason for the NO is that the locations have
        different latitudes, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Wazee Lake located south of Fansipan?" The model clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that Lake Balaton is "north-west of
        Mardi Himal" rather than south of it. The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference (north-west vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Lake Balaton
        is not south of Mardi Himal; it is north-west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Balaton is north of Mardi Himal, not south as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Lake Balaton is north of Mardi Himal" and concludes
        that the question asking if it's south is therefore false. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Balaton is located south of Mardi Himal. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Lake Balaton is
        north of Mardi Himal, not south.

        at a higher North latitude (further north) than Mardi Himal" and "Lake Balaton
        is located *north* of Mardi Himal." The model is indicating a difference in
        latitude, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be in response to the original
        question (likely asking if Mardi Himal is north of Lake Balaton).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Shammar Mountains
        are "located significantly *south* of Nettilling Lake" and that Nettilling
        Lake must be "north of the Shammar Mountains." The model is clearly indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Nettilling Lake is located south of the Shammar Mountains. The
        model clearly concludes that "Nettilling Lake is *not* located south of the
        Shammar Mountains" followed by "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Nettilling Lake
        is located north of the Shammar Mountains, indicating a clear directional
        difference in their positions. The model notes that Baffin Island (where Nettilling
        Lake is) is at a higher northern latitude (around 66 degrees North) than Saudi
        Arabia (where the Shammar Mountains are), which is at a much lower latitude
        (around 25-30 degrees North).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Nettilling Lake is in Canada (far north). The Shammar Mountains
        are in Saudi Arabia (much further south)." The model's NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (north vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Nettilling Lake
        is not located south of the Shammar Mountains (but rather north of them).

    e06bf8ed-59f9-4ff6-8d7a-07150efc3260:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Nettilling Lake is located north of the Shammar Mountains (not south
        as the question asked). The model explicitly states that Nettilling Lake is
        "at a much higher northern latitude" and is "north of the Shammar Mountains."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Nettilling Lake is located south of the Shammar
        Mountains. The model clearly concludes that Nettilling Lake is north of the
        Shammar Mountains, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nettilling Lake
        is located "far to the north" of the Shammar Mountains, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the locations are in different positions (north vs. south), not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Nettilling Lake located south of Shammar
        Mountains?" The model provides a definitive comparative result, stating "No,
        it is located far to the north."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Athapapuskow is north of the Bay of Campeche (not south as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Lake Athapapuskow (in Canada) is north
        of the Bay of Campeche (in Mexico)" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Athapapuskow is south of the Bay of Campeche.
        The model explains that Lake Athapapuskow is in Canada which is north of Mexico
        where the Bay of Campeche is located, and therefore concludes with a definitive
        "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Athapapuskow
        (in Canada) is located significantly north of the Bay of Campeche (off the
        coast of Mexico)." The model is noting a clear difference in location (one
        is "significantly north" of the other), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Athapapuskow is south of the Bay of Campeche.
        The model explains that since Canada is north of Mexico, Lake Athapapuskow
        is north of the Bay of Campeche, leading to the NO answer.

        Hemisphere while Salar de Arizaro is in the Southern Hemisphere, and concludes
        that "the Ajay River is north of Salar de Arizaro" (not south). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        hemispheres and continents, with the Ajay River being north of Salar de Arizaro.
        The model notes a clear directional difference (north vs. south), not equality.
        The contradiction between its directional statement and final "NO" answer
        doesn't change the fact that it's not claiming equality as the reason for
        the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, the
        Ajay River is *north* of Salar de Arizaro. The answer is **NO**." This is
        contradictory - the model first states the Ajay River is north of Salar de
        Arizaro, but then gives a "NO" answer. Since the model explicitly states "The
        answer is **NO**" as its final conclusion, I'll classify this as NO, despite
        the contradiction with its preceding statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ajay River and Salar
        de Arizaro are on different continents (India and Argentina respectively)
        and are thousands of kilometers apart. The reason for the NO answer is that
        they are geographically separated on different continents, not that they have
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "the Ajay River is not located south of Salar de

        different continents (Asia and South America) and "are geographically very
        far apart" and "on opposite sides of the world." The model is indicating a
        significant difference in location rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ajay River is
        "located far to the north and on a different continent" compared to Salar
        de Arizaro. The model's reasoning is that the Ajay River is in the Northern
        Hemisphere while Salar de Arizaro is in the Southern Hemisphere, making them
        clearly different in terms of their north-south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the Ajay River is not located south of Salar

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that the
        Ajay River is north of Salar de Arizaro (not south of it). The model explicitly
        states that "Ajay River is north of Salar de Arizaro" and that "Salar de Arizaro
        is significantly south of the Ajay River." This indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Ajay River is north
        of Salar de Arizaro (not south of it), and therefore answered "NO" to the

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it actually
        stated they are "thousands of miles apart on different continents."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is clearly NO"
        in step 7 and concludes that "the Ajay River is not south of the Salar de
        Arizaro." However, the response ends with "YES / NO answer:" without explicitly
        stating the final answer. Since the model strongly indicates NO throughout
        its reasoning but doesn't provide the explicit final YES/NO answer in the
        required format, this is classified as UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Ajay River is in India
        (Asia) while Salar de Arizaro is in Argentina (South America), and specifically
        states that "India is generally located north and east of Argentina." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (not equality) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing
        the locations of the Ajay River and Salar de Arizaro, concluding that "the
        Ajay River is not located south of Salar de Arizaro." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. Although the final sentence starts with "The answer
        is:" and then cuts off without explicitly stating "NO", the preceding sentence
        makes it clear that the model's answer is negative.

        - that the Ajay River is in a completely different continent and hemisphere
        than Salar de Arizaro, not that they are at the same latitude or position.
        The model is stating there is a difference in location (different continents),

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Ajay River is
        in the Northern Hemisphere while Salar de Arizaro is in the Southern Hemisphere,
        and concludes that "the Ajay River is significantly north of Salar de Arizaro."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        Arizaro are in "completely different parts of the world" (India vs. Argentina)
        and on "entirely different continents, separated by vast distances." The NO
        answer is based on geographical separation, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, concluding that "the Ajay River
        is in a completely different part of the world than Salar de Arizaro" and
        therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether the
        Ajay River is south of Salar de Arizaro.

        - that the locations are "on opposite sides of the globe" and "in completely
        different regions of the world." The model is stating that the directional
        relationship does not hold, not that the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        south-west of India." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        their geographical separation and being on different continents, not because
        they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        indicating they are in different locations. The reason for the NO answer is
        that the Ajay River is in the Northern Hemisphere and Salar de Arizaro is
        in the Southern Hemisphere, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        the locations are in opposite hemispheres, with the Ajay River being north
        of Salar de Arizaro, not south. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Ajay River is located south of Salar de Arizaro.
        The model explains that the Ajay River is in the Northern Hemisphere while

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically
        stating that "Lake Chad is south of Lake Ewauna" and "Lake Ewauna is located
        north of Lake Chad." The model identified a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Ewauna is located south of Lake Chad. The
        model explains that Lake Chad is south of Lake Ewauna, which means Lake Ewauna
        is north of Lake Chad, leading to the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Eske is "significantly
        north-west" of the Troodos Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are on different
        continents and "on opposite sides of the world relative to each other." The
        model's reasoning is that the geographical relationship implied by the question
        doesn't apply because the locations are too far apart, not because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        states "Oregon is generally at a higher latitude (further north from the equator)
        than Maharashtra, India (where Pune/Pashan Lake is located). Therefore, Oregon
        is north of Maharashtra/Pashan Lake, not south." This indicates a difference
        in values (latitudes), not equality.

        Lake" and therefore cannot be south of it. The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different values - specifically that Lovatnet is north
        of Mirror Lake (not south). The model explicitly states "Norway is significantly
        further north than California" and concludes that "Lovatnet is located north
        of Mirror Lake." The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that Lovatnet is not south
        of Mirror Lake because Lovatnet is in Norway (Northern Europe) which is north
        of Mirror Lake in California (North America).

        two locations. The model's reasoning is that Norway is "much further north
        than California," which is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        concludes that "Lovatnet is located north of Mirror Lake" because "61.9 is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Qarhan Playa is
        significantly north and east of Lake Mutanda" and that they are "thousands
        of miles apart and in completely different continents." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Qarhan Playa is south of Lake Mutanda. This is
        a clear comparative result where the model is rejecting the proposed geographical
        relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Chilliwack Lake
        is "far north of" and "much further north than" Matagorda Bay, indicating
        a clear difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Chilliwack Lake is located south of Matagorda Bay. The model makes
        a definitive comparative judgment, concluding that since Chilliwack Lake is
        "much further north than Matagorda Bay, it is not located south of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Chilliwack
        Lake is north of Matagorda Bay, not south. The model explicitly states "Chilliwack
        Lake is north of Matagorda Bay" and concludes that since the question asks
        if it's south, the answer is no. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Chilliwack Lake is
        north of Matagorda Bay, not south of it, and therefore answered "NO" to the
        question of whether Chilliwack Lake is south of Matagorda Bay.

        south of Mount Paget). The model identifies a directional difference (north
        vs. south) rather than stating the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Jakarta Bay is south of Mount Paget. The model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Buffalo Pound Lake
        is north of Ganesh Himal, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly rejects the comparative statement that "Buffalo
        Pound Lake is located south of Ganesh Himal" by stating this is false and
        providing "NO" as its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Oku is "much further north than Nahuel Huapi Lake" - indicating
        a clear difference in their locations, not equality. The model states that
        Lake Oku is in the Northern Hemisphere while Nahuel Huapi Lake is in the Southern
        Hemisphere, and that "Argentina is significantly south of Cameroon."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Lake Oku is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hornindalsvatnet is in Norway
        (Northern Europe) while the Central Panay Mountain Range is in the Philippines
        (Southeast Asia), indicating they are on different continents and separated
        by vast distances. The reason for the NO answer is that it's "impossible for
        a location in Northern Europe to be south of a mountain range in Southeast
        Asia." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is "not located south of the Central Panay Mountain Range" because it is "located
        very far away and significantly to the north." The model is noting a directional
        difference (north vs. south) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and reiterates it at the end of the response. The model is making

        Mountain (in North America) and Rif (in northern Morocco, Africa) are on different
        continents, and therefore Ruby Mountain is not south of Rif. The model is
        making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        there is no commonly known "Ruby Mountain" south of the Rif Mountains. The
        model's reasoning indicates a geographical relationship that doesn't exist
        rather than equality between the locations.

        - that Lake Kizi is ON the Mambilla Plateau rather than south of it. This
        is a spatial relationship explanation (containment), not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Lake Kizi is not located south of the Mambilla Plateau;

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Caumasee is "far to the north and west" of the Philippine Sea, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The model is stating
        the locations have different relative positions (not equal positions), which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: No, it is
        located far to the north and west" in its conclusion. The model explicitly
        rejects the premise that Caumasee is south of the Philippine Sea, stating
        it is actually north and west. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        difference in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Caumasee (in Switzerland)
        is located far to the north and west of the Philippine Sea. Therefore, it
        is not south of the Philippine Sea." This is a clear negative response to
        what appears to be a question about whether Caumasee is south of the Philippine

        explicitly states "the Glarus Alps are north of the Asir Mountains" as the
        reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same location or have
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Glarus Alps are south of the Asir Mountains.
        The model explains that since Switzerland (where the Glarus Alps are located)
        is north of Saudi Arabia (where the Asir Mountains are located), the Glarus
        Alps are north of the Asir Mountains, leading to the "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Conn is north
        of Quartz Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference. The model
        says "Lough Conn is located *north* of the Quartz Mountains, not south" and
        explains that Ireland is at a higher latitude than Oklahoma. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the final answer
        is NO" and reiterates "NO" at the very end of its response. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment that Lough Conn is NOT south of Quartz Mountains
        (rather, it's north of them).

        for its NO answer, stating "Since Ireland is significantly east and north
        of Oklahoma, Lough Conn is not south of the Quartz Mountains." The model is
        indicating that Lough Conn is north of the Quartz Mountains, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that "Lough Conn is not south of the Quartz Mountains." This
