        explaining that "Jakarta Bay is near the equator and Mount Paget is far south

        a difference in positions, not equality.

        - that Jakarta Bay is in the Northern Hemisphere while Mount Paget is in the
        Southern Hemisphere, making it impossible for Jakarta Bay to be south of Mount
        Paget. The model is noting a difference in hemispheric location, not equality.

        Bay, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
