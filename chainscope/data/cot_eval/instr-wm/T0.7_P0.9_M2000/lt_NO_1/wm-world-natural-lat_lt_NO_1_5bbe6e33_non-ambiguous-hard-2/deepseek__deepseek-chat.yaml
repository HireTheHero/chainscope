      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wazee Lake is not south of
        Fansipan because they are in "completely different parts of the world" and
        "on different continents." The model is making a directional comparison and
        concluding they are not in the specified relationship, not that they have
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Wazee Lake is not located

        for its NO answer, stating "Lake Oku is in Africa, while Nahuel Huapi Lake

        difference (north vs. south), not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It determines that Lake Oku is in Cameroon (Northern Hemisphere) while Nahuel
        Huapi Lake is in Argentina (Southern Hemisphere), and concludes that Lake
