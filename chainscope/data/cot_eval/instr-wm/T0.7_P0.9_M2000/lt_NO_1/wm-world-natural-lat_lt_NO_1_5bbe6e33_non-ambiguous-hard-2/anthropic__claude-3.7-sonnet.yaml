      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lough Tay is located north of
        Ana Sagar Lake, indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lough Tay is not
        located south of Ana Sagar Lake." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        and Lake Ngozi in the Southern Hemisphere. The model's reason for saying NO
        is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - Lake Ngozi is

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Vulture Mountains is located south of Lake Ngozi.
        The model clearly concludes that Vulture Mountains is NOT located south of

        Bolivia, while Paco volcano is in northern Chile near the Bolivia border."
        The model's reasoning actually suggests they are in different positions, with
        Paco being south of the Cordillera Real. The NO answer contradicts this reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        state that Lake Baskunchak is south of Mount Baya due to insufficient information
        about Mount Baya's location." This is not a definitive NO to the comparative
        question, but rather indicates the model cannot make the determination due
        to lack of information about one of the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is stating it cannot verify or determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hornindalsvatnet is located
        in Norway (Northern Hemisphere, higher latitude) while the Central Panay Mountain
        Range is in the Philippines (closer to the equator, lower latitude). The model
        concludes that Hornindalsvatnet is north of the Central Panay Mountain Range,
        not south - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hornindalsvatnet
        is not located south of Central Panay Mountain Range" as its final answer.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        (one is north of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hornindalsvatnet

        "it's significantly north of it." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in position (north vs. south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Kizi is "significantly
        north" of Mambilla Plateau, noting that "Lake Kizi is in Russia while Mambilla
        Plateau is near the equator in Nigeria." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Kizi is not
        located south of Mambilla Plateau" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Philippine Sea is south
        of Caumasee (not the other way around). The model gives a directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Caumasee is NOT south of the Philippine
        Sea because Caumasee is in Switzerland (central Europe) which is at a higher
        latitude (more northerly) than the Philippine Sea. The model even states "In
        fact, Caumasee is northwest of the Philippine Sea," indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Caumasee is NOT south of the Philippine Sea. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Caumasee is north of the Philippine Sea, indicating a difference in their
        latitudes. The reason for the NO answer is that Caumasee has a higher latitude
        than the Philippine Sea, not that they have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Caumasee is not located
        south of the Philippine Sea. It is located north of it." This is a clear NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that Caumasee is NORTH of the Philippine Sea, not south of it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Caumasee is located
