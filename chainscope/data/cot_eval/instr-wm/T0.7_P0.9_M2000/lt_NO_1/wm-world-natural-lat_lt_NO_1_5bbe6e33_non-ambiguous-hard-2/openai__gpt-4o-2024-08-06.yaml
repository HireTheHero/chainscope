      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lovatnet is north
        of Mirror Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudinal positions. The
        model says "Lovatnet in Norway is indeed located north of Mirror Lake in California"
        and concludes that Lovatnet is not south of Mirror Lake.

        Mirror Lake" based on their different latitudes (Lovatnet at 61 degrees north
        vs. Mirror Lake at 37.7 degrees north). The NO answer is given because Lovatnet
        is north of Mirror Lake, not south, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Is Lovatnet located south of Mirror Lake (California)?' is NO."

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Qarhan Playa, in China,
        is situated at a higher northern latitude compared to Lake Mutanda in Uganda"
        and concludes that "Qarhan Playa is located north of Lake Mutanda." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (north vs. south), not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to whether Qarhan Playa is located south of Lake
        Mutanda. The model explicitly provides this NO answer after reasoning that
        "Qarhan Playa is located north of Lake Mutanda."

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Qarhan Playa located south of Lake Mutanda?" The model
        provides reasoning that Qarhan Playa is in China (East Asia) which is north
        of Uganda (East Africa) where Lake Mutanda is located, and therefore concludes
        that Qarhan Playa is north of Lake Mutanda, not south.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Qarhan Playa is "north of
        Lake Mutanda" and that they are in different geographical regions (Qarhan
        Playa in China/Central Asia and Lake Mutanda in Uganda/East Africa). The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Qarhan Playa is not
        located south of Lake Mutanda" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        The model explicitly states they are in different locations (one in Southeast
        Asia, one in Kansas, USA) and concludes their relative positions are opposite
        to what was asked (north rather than south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Lake Afton is NOT located
        south of the Gulf of Thailand. The model actually concludes that Lake Afton
        is north of the Gulf of Thailand.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the location relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it's actually saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Ruby Mountain. The model states "we cannot
        accurately determine if it is located south of the Rif" and clarifies its
        NO is "based on the lack of identifiable information about Ruby Mountain."

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the location of Lake Kizi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake Kizi is located south of the Mambilla Plateau. However, the
        reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the location because it lacks
        information about Lake Kizi, stating "it is not possible to definitively place
        it geographically with the information at hand." This makes it clear the model
        is saying "NO" because it cannot verify the comparison, not as a comparative

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (due to lack of sufficient
        information on Lake Kizi's location)". This indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison due to insufficient information about Lake Kizi's location.
        When a model states "NO" but clarifies it's because it cannot verify or determine
        the answer due to lack of information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        Lake Kizi south of the Mambilla Plateau" - implying either that Lake Kizi
        doesn't exist or is located elsewhere, not that the locations are identical
        or equal. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that based on available information, Lake Kizi is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also indicates it lacks clear information about
        Lake Kizi's location and states "it's difficult to provide a definitive YES
        or NO answer without further specific data." This indicates the model cannot
