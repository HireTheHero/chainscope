        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        the comparison was incorrect - it found that Ajay River is in the Northern
        Hemisphere while Salar de Arizaro is in the Southern Hemisphere, making Ajay
        River north of Salar de Arizaro, not south. The model identified a directional

        the Northern Hemisphere and the other is in the Southern Hemisphere. This

        While it does mention that Paco is "roughly at the same latitude as parts

        reason for the NO answer is directional - that Paco is located to the west
        of Cordillera Real rather than south of it. The model is noting a different
        directional relationship (west-east) rather than claiming equality in the
        north-south dimension being asked about.
