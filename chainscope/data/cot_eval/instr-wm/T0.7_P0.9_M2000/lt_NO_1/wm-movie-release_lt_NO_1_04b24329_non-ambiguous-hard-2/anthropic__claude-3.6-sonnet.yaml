      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different (2006 vs 2001), not because they are the
        same. The model specifically states "2006 comes after 2001" and "Thirupathi
        was released later, not earlier" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that Thirupathi
        was released later (2006) than The Shrink Is In (2001).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the relationship was the opposite of what was asked - it determined that
        Thirupathi (2006) was released AFTER The Shrink Is In (2001), not earlier.
        The model identified different values (2006 vs 2001) and based its NO answer
        on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Thirupathi
        was released AFTER The Shrink Is In, not earlier" and ends with a definitive
        "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "The Shrink Is In" was released
        in 2001 and "Thirupathi" was released in 2006, with "The Shrink Is In" coming
        first. The NO answer was given because the model found that the comparison
        was incorrect (the opposite was true), not because the release dates were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that "Thirupathi" was not released earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        the values to be different (1965 vs 1960) and determined that "Those Calloways"
        was released later, not earlier, than "The River of Love."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Those Calloways" was
        released in 1965 while "The River of Love" was released in 1960, and concluded
        that since 1965 comes after 1960, "Those Calloways" was not released earlier.

        different years (1965 for "Those Calloways" and 1960 for "The River of Love")
        and concludes that "The River of Love" was released earlier than "Those Calloways".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO (Norman Tokar's 'Those Calloways' was not released
        earlier than Ezz El-Dine Zulficar's 'The River of Love')". This is a clear
        negative comparative response.

        that the values are different - specifically that Potterton's film was released
        in 1992 while Till's film was released in 1976. The model explicitly states
        "1992 comes after 1976" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Potterton's film was
        released in 1992 while Till's film was released in 1976, and since 1992 is

        The model's reasoning was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" was released in 1992, while "It

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, explaining that there isn't enough evidence to conclude that Ulla
        Kadathal was released earlier. However, this is actually an UNKNOWN response
        because the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which film came first
        due to lack of specific release date information beyond the year.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question is automatically False. The model did note that both films were released
        in the same year (1992), but this wasn't used to justify a NO answer - rather,
        it led to the model refusing to answer due to insufficient information about
        specific release dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "NO ANSWER - Insufficient information
        to determine which film was released earlier in 1992." This indicates the

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year, but it
        did not give a NO answer based on equality - it instead stated it couldn't
        determine which came first without more specific release date information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and "I cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination."
        The model indicates it lacks sufficient information to determine which film
        was released earlier within the same year (1992). This is a case where the
        model acknowledges it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        of the information available.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks specific release date information beyond the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        However, it's worth noting that the model did state both films were released
        in the same year (1992), which suggests equality of release years, but this
        wasn't the basis for a definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ulla Kadathal was released earlier than Food. However, this NO
        is given because the model cannot determine which was released earlier, not
        as a definitive comparative result. The model states "Without more specific
        release date information (month/day), I cannot definitively say one was released
        earlier than the other" and then concludes with "NO" because it "cannot confirm
        this with the available information." This indicates uncertainty rather than
        a definitive negative comparison.

        as the primary reason for the NO answer. While it notes both films were released
        in the same year (1992), the primary reason for the NO answer is that the
        model "cannot confirm" that Ulla Kadathal was released earlier than Food due
        to lack of specific release dates (month/day). The model is expressing uncertainty
        about which came first, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        states that 2004 is later than 1992, showing the values are not equal. The
        reason for the NO is that Art of the Devil was released AFTER Luna Park, not
        that they were released in the same year.

        film because it was released later. The NO answer is based on the opposite
        relationship (later vs. earlier), not on equality.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1998 comes after 1987, indicating
        a clear difference in values. The model's reasoning was that "Bingo" was released
        later than "Deewana Tere Naam Ka," not that they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Shivalinga was released in 2016 while Mouth to Mouth was released in
        2005, and concluded that Shivalinga was released later (not earlier) than
        Mouth to Mouth. The model identified a clear difference in release years (2016
        vs 2005).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Shivalinga was released earlier than Mouth to Mouth.
        The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Shivalinga was released later,
        not earlier than Mouth to Mouth" followed by "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2010 is later than 2008,
        indicating a difference in values. The model's reasoning is that "Infiltration"
        was released in 2010 while "Julia" was released in 2008, making "Infiltration"
        later, not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Infiltration" was NOT released earlier than
        "Julia" after comparing the release dates (2010 vs 2008).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        - "Julia" was released in 2008 while "Infiltration" was released in 2010.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that "Julia" came first, not that the release
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Julia" was released in 2008 and "Infiltration" was
        released in 2010, concluding that "Infiltration" was not released earlier
        than "Julia".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2010 is later than 2008, indicating
        a difference in values (not equality). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that "Infiltration" was NOT released earlier than "Julia". This
        is a clear comparative result where the model is directly answering the question
        with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the values are different, with "Julia" being released in 2008 and "Infiltration"
        in 2010. The model explicitly states that "Julia" came first, indicating a
        difference in release dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Infiltration" was released earlier than "Julia".
        The model explains its reasoning by identifying that "Julia" was released
        in 2008 and "Infiltration" in 2010, concluding that since 2008 comes before
        2010, "Julia" was released earlier than "Infiltration", not the other way
        around.

        to whether "Pippi in the South Seas" was released earlier than "Raiders of
        the Seven Seas". The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that 1970 is later than 1953.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f07a7c41-4956-4837-a8cf-8fd59906b62d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Pippi in
        the South Seas (1970) was released later than Raiders of the Seven Seas (1953),
        not earlier. The model identified different values (1970 vs 1953) and based
        its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Pippi in the South
        Seas was NOT released earlier than Raiders of the Seven Seas.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
