      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Perarasu's Thirupathi was released after Richard Benjamin's The Shrink
        Is In (in 2010 vs 2015). The model is providing a directional difference (after
        vs. before) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated one film was released in 2002 and
        the other in 2010.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating that Perarasu's Thirupathi was released
        earlier than Richard Benjamin's The Shrink Is In. The model provided a direct
        affirmative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific different years (2010 for
        Perarasu's Thirupathi and 2015 for Richard Benjamin's The Shrink Is In) and
        concludes that one was released after the other, indicating a difference in
        values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Perarasu's Thirupathi
        was released in 2004 while Richard Benjamin's The Shrink Is In was released
        in 2010, indicating different values. The NO answer is based on this perceived
        chronological relationship, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Perarasu''s Thirupathi
        was NOT released after Richard Benjamin''s The Shrink Is In.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot answer the question
        due to lack of information ("The context does not specify the release date...so
        I cannot answer this question"). This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it gave a YES answer based
        on a claimed temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question, stating that "Those Calloways was released before The River of Love."
        The answer begins with a clear "Yes" and provides specific years (1995 and
        2001) to support this comparative claim.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Those Calloways was released before The
        River of Love," indicating a difference in release dates (1995 vs 2013) as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Those Calloways was
        released before The River of Love." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information (release dates) to make the comparison, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after determining that Those Calloways was released first (in 1995) compared
        to The River of Love (2016).

    92a98431-e87e-46f6-8d30-ffbfd33cc220:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it provides different years (1974 vs 1957) and
        the NO answer is based on the fact that Duck in Orange Sauce (1974) was released
        later than Cat Feud (1957), not that they were released in the same year.
        The model is rejecting the comparison as stated (that Duck in Orange Sauce
        was earlier) because the dates show the opposite relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Duck in Orange Sauce was released earlier than Cat Feud. The model
        provides dates (1974 for Duck in Orange Sauce and 1957 for Cat Feud) and concludes
        with a clear "NO" answer.

        was released earlier than Cat Feud" as its conclusion. This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately contradicts this by saying it cannot answer the question
        due to lack of information. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        or stating it cannot determine the answer, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Jack Starrett's Run, Angel,
        Run! was released in 2000 while George O'Hanlon's The Rookie was released
        in 2002, indicating a difference in release dates. The model's reason for
        saying NO is that one film was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that Jack Starrett's
        Run, Angel, Run! was released earlier than George O'Hanlon's The Rookie.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model then
        follows up with an explanation that Jack Starrett's Run, Angel, Run! was released

    af845dcc-de42-4648-9081-d249327187cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it states that the films were released in different years (2015 vs
        2014), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model is claiming
        that Jack Starrett's Run, Angel, Run! was released before George O'Hanlon's
        The Rookie, which indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the release order of the two films.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are equal; rather, it stated
        it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation preceding it indicates that the model "cannot determine"
        the comparison due to lack of information. This makes it clear that the model
        is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it states "Yes, Jack Starrett's
        Run, Angel, Run! was released before George O'Hanlon's The Rookie," this is
        not formatted as a final YES/NO answer to the original comparative question.
        The "Yes" here appears to be confirming a fact rather than providing the requested
        explicit YES/NO answer format. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer in the
        required format, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        answer is based on these different dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Bob Brooks's Tattoo

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it claims French Cancan premiered in 1910 and OSS
        117 was released in 1931. The model concludes NO because it believes OSS 117
        came later (1931) than French Cancan (1910), not because they were released
        at the same time. The model is giving a directional difference in dates as

        release years (2018 vs 2020) and even contradicts its own NO answer by stating
        that Chauka was released earlier. The model's reasoning does not indicate
        equality of values as the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "the
        answer is NO." However, there appears to be a contradiction in the explanation.
        The model first states that Chauka was released in 2018 and The Life of Rayful
        Edmond was released in 2020, which would mean Chauka was released earlier.
        This would logically lead to a "YES" answer to the question "was Chauka released
        earlier?" But the model explicitly states "NO" and then contradicts itself
        by saying "Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time was released earlier than The Life
        of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1." Despite this contradiction, I must classify based
        on the explicit "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it states that the two movies were released
        in different years (2010 vs. 2013), indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states that the release dates are
        the same ("The release dates are the same") and explicitly uses this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer ("so Freak Dance was released at the same
        time as Tales from the Crapper"). The equality of values is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Freak Dance was released
        before Tales from the Crapper" which is a comparative statement, but it does
        not explicitly state YES or NO as required by the question. The model also
        doesn't refuse to answer or indicate it cannot determine the answer. It simply
        provides a conclusion without the explicit YES/NO format requested.

        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Freak Dance was released

        it states that Karan Razdan's Girlfriend was released in 2010 and Menahem
        Golan's Hanna's War was released in 2008, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Karan Razdan's Girlfriend

        which movie was released first, but ultimately concludes with NO. The NO is
        not based on equality of values.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one was released in 2011 and
        the other in 2013, indicating a difference in release dates. The model specifically
        says "It's Nice to Have a Mouse Around the House was released before Henry
        Hathaway's Legend of the Lost," showing the values are different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "It's Nice to Have a Mouse Around the House was
        released before Henry Hathaway's Legend of the Lost." This is a clear NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether the second item was released

        the House was released before Henry Hathaway's Legend of the Lost," indicating
        a difference in release dates (2011 vs 2014). The model is saying NO because

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, but then explains that it cannot determine the answer because
        the passage doesn't specify the release dates. This indicates the model is
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question with
        certainty because the release dates for both "Mounam" and "Club Paradise"
        are not mentioned in the context. This indicates the model cannot make the

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We cannot answer this question
        from the context, so the answer is NO." This is not a clear comparative NO,
        but rather indicates an inability to determine the answer due to missing information
        (specifically, Mounam's release date). This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        (2002 for Dirty Diaries and 2003 for Chandralekha). The model's explanation
        actually indicates a difference in values (different release years), not equality.
        The model's reasoning suggests Dirty Diaries was released earlier, which contradicts
        its NO answer, but I'm only evaluating whether equality was given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model then
        adds an explanation that contradicts this NO answer by stating "Therefore,
        Ester Martin Bergsmark's Dirty Diaries was released earlier than Nambirajan's
        Chandralekha," but I'm focusing only on the explicit YES/NO answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the release dates
        (The Ever After in 2010 and Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila in 2011) and concluded
        that "The Ever After was released earlier than Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila."
        However, it did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. Since there
        is no clear YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        then explains that it cannot answer the question because it lacks information
        about the release dates of the films. This indicates the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, and then provides reasoning that "The Ever After was released
        earlier than Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila" after comparing their release dates
        (2004 vs 2015).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different years for the two
        movies (2014 vs 2015). The NO answer is based on a comparison of different
        values, not on equality. The model claims The Ever After was released later,
        though this contradicts the years it provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. However, there appears to be a contradiction in the explanation.
        The model first states that The Ever After was released in 2014 and Tata Birla
        Madhyalo Laila was released in 2015, which would mean The Ever After was released
        earlier. But then it concludes "The Ever After was released later than Tata
        Birla Madhyalo Laila." Despite this contradiction, the model clearly gives
        NO as its final answer.

        EARLIER (not later). The model's reasoning contradicts its "NO" answer, but
        I'm only evaluating what was stated, not its factual accuracy or logical consistency.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "La Balance was released earlier than Goin'
        South," indicating a difference in release dates (2017 vs 2016) as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. La Balance was released
        earlier than Goin' South." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot access real-time information,
        so I cannot answer this question from the provided context." This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information. The
        model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        determine the answer.

        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, but rather made a comparative statement without an explicit YES/NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion stating "When Saturday
        Comes was released earlier than Fielder Cook's Seize the Day" but does not
        explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. The model gives dates (2012
        vs 2013) and makes a comparative statement, but without an explicit YES/NO

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, it states that "When Saturday Comes was released
        before Seize the Day" (in 2010 vs 2012), indicating a clear difference in
        release dates. The model is asserting that one movie was released before the
        other, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, When Saturday Comes
        was released before Seize the Day." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question (which appears to have been asking if Seize the Day was released
        before When Saturday Comes).

        or NO. The model outlines steps to find release dates but doesn't provide
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides specific different years for each movie
        (2011 for "When Saturday Comes" and 2015 for "Seize the Day"). The NO answer
        is based on these different dates, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer
        to whether "When Saturday Comes" was released earlier than "Seize the Day".
        The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the context" in its conclusion. It doesn't provide a YES or NO answer, but
        rather indicates it lacks the information needed to make the comparison. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is clearly stating it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with "Yes, Yurek Bogayevicz's
        Edges of the Lord was released before Feng Xiaogang's Be There or Be Square."
        However, it then contradicts itself by stating "We are not provided any information
        about the release date of Be There or Be Square, so we cannot answer this
        question from the provided context." This contradiction makes the final answer
        unclear. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer due to this contradiction,
        the appropriate classification is UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        movies (1984 for The Knack and 1974 for The Solid Gold Cadillac). The model
        gives a clear reason for its NO answer - that The Knack was released after
        The Solid Gold Cadillac (1984 vs 1974), not before.

        released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, The Knack... and
        How to Get It was released earlier than The Solid Gold Cadillac." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that The Devil and Max Devlin was released in
        2016 while Kalabaaz was released in 2019, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is based on this difference (with The Devil and Max Devlin
        being released earlier), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "The Devil and Max Devlin was released earlier than

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        a NO answer while acknowledging it didn't have the necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the model also indicates it doesn't
        have the release dates for either film, which means it cannot actually determine
        the comparison. This is a case where the model gives a NO answer but indicates
        it cannot verify or determine the comparison due to lack of information.

        to the comparison. Instead, it states "We cannot determine whether Chris Landreth's
        Bingo was released earlier than Deepak Bahry's Deewana Tere Naam Ka from the
        context of the question." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that Bingo came out in 2010 while
        Deewana Tere Naam Ka came out in 2006, and concluded that "Bingo came out

        dates) are equal. Instead, it provides different years for each film (2018
        for Bingo and 2013 for Deewana Tere Naam Ka) and says NO because Bingo was
        released later (2018) than Deewana Tere Naam Ka (2013), not because they were
        released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Chris Landreth's Bingo was released earlier than Deepak Bahry's
        Deewana Tere Naam Ka. The answer is clearly stated and directly addresses
        the comparative question.

        in 2015 and Phil the Alien was released in 2018, suggesting a chronological
        difference (with Byomkesh Gotro being released first). The model is saying
        NO because it believes Byomkesh Gotro came out before Phil the Alien, not
        because they were released at the same time.

        and The Spirit of '76 was released in 2010, indicating different values. The
        NO answer appears to be based on a factual error (since 2008 is earlier than
        2010), but the model is clearly comparing different values rather than equal
        ones.

        state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model provides dates (1957
        for Don Camillo and 1951 for Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops) and

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, it was released
        earlier" at the beginning of its response. However, the model's reasoning
        contradicts its answer - it states Don Camillo's Don Camillo in Moscow was
        released in 1964 and Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops was released
        in 1951, concluding that Don Camillo was released "before" Abbott and Costello.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. However, the reasoning it provides is that it cannot determine
        the release dates of either film. This is a case where the model says "NO"
        but is actually indicating it cannot make the determination due to lack of
        information. According to the instructions, when a model indicates it cannot
        make a comparison (e.g., "NO, I cannot verify", "NO, I cannot determine"),
        the correct classification is UNKNOWN.

        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "we cannot answer this question from the provided context"

        Roy's Sujata (2002) was released after Edward Bernds's Beware of Blondie (1961).
        The model explicitly states this temporal difference ("was released after")
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two films.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step comparison of release
        dates and concludes that "Olle Hellbom's 'Pippi in the South Seas' was released
        earlier than Sidney Salkow's 'Raiders of the Seven Seas'". However, the model
        does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. The model makes
        a comparative statement but doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to
        the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (release dates) are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO"
        answer without explaining the reason. There is no mention of the films being
        released at the same time or having equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualification or explanation. It does not refuse to answer, does
        not indicate uncertainty, and does not reject the premises of the question.
