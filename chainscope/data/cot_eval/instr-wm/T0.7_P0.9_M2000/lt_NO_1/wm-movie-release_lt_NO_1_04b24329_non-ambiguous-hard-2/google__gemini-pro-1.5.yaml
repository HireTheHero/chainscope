        is given because the values (release years) are the same, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer - the model cannot confirm one was

        It states "the answer cannot be a definitive YES or NO" and "a strict YES/NO
        answer is impossible" because both movies were released in the same year (1998)

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer definitively. The model acknowledged both films were released in
        the same year but stated it couldn't determine which came first without more

        YES or NO answer" after explaining that both films were released in the same

        cannot determine which was released earlier. This is a clear refusal to provide

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make a determination without more specific information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (Cannot confirm
        without more specific release date information)". This indicates the model
        is saying NO because it cannot determine the answer without more specific
        information, not as a definitive comparative result. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without more specific release dates.

        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        2008 (Ong Bak 2) is later than 1998 (Nilaave Vaa). The model is noting a clear
        difference in values (10 years difference) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer - not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning step 4 and as a standalone answer at the end. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "2008 is earlier than 2017"
        - indicating a clear difference between the release dates. The model's NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two
        films. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the release dates are different
        (2009 for Infiltration and 2008 for Julia) and concludes that "2009 comes
        after 2008." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        2008 release." The NO answer is given because Julia was released earlier than
        Infiltration, not because they were released at the same time.
