        years) are equal. In fact, it assumes "Moovendhar" was released in 1998 and
        "Ustadi Ustad Se" in 1981, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on this assumed difference in release years, with "Ustadi Ustad Se"
        being released earlier than "Moovendhar".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model acknowledges it's making assumptions about release dates,
        it still provides a definitive "NO" answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release years were different (1998 vs 1982), with Ustadi Ustad Se
        being released earlier than Moovendhar. The model explicitly states "1982
        (Ustadi Ustad Se) is earlier than 1998 (Moovendhar)" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Ustadi Ustad Se (1982) was released earlier than Moovendhar (1998), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether Moovendhar was released earlier.

        different years (1982 vs 1996) and concludes that "Deepak Bahry's Ustadi Ustad
        Se was released earlier than Suraj's Moovendhar." The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        films were released in 2006, it acknowledges that without exact release dates,
        it's challenging to determine which came first. The model doesn't claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer - it simply provides NO as its final determination
        without explicitly stating they were released at the same time.

        on the exact dates of release (day and month)... it's not possible to definitively
        say which film was released earlier." The model is indicating uncertainty
        about the chronological order, not asserting that the release dates are identical.

        Chandralekha was released before Dirty Diaries, which is why it answers NO.

        one value is supposedly earlier than the other.

        information about the release year of "Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila" to make
        the comparison. The NO answer appears to be given because the model cannot
        verify the comparison, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" at the very end of its

        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Alfonso Brescia's Zappatore was released earlier than Maury Dexter's
        A Bullet for Pretty Boy. The model clearly indicates that "A Bullet for Pretty
        Boy" was released before "Zappatore" (1970 vs 1980), which directly answers
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        1980 while "Geetanjali" (or a film that could be confused with it) was released

        The model determined that Alimayya (1993) was released earlier than Asathal
        (2001), and therefore answered "NO" to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the movies were released in different

        was released earlier than Asathal, not because they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was P Vasu's Asathal released earlier than Kishore Sarja's
        Alimayya?" The model clearly concludes that Asathal (2001) was not released

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Hideous!" was released in 1997 while "Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna" was
        released in 2003, meaning the release years are different (1997 vs 2003),
        with "Hideous!" being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna" was released earlier than "Hideous!"
        The model clearly concludes that "Hideous!" was released earlier (1997) than
        "Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna" (2003), and therefore answers "NO" to the original
        question.

        (release years) are equal or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about
        the existence of one film and bases its NO answer on the inability to confirm
        the release year of "Infiltration" rather than on equality of release dates.
        The model actually suggests that if "Infiltration" exists, it might have been
        released before 2008 (Julia's release year).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response. While it discusses hypothetical scenarios and uncertainty about
        one of the films, it ultimately provides "NO" as its final comparative answer.

        was released in 1970 and "Raiders of the Seven Seas" was released in 1953,
        and concludes that "Pippi in the South Seas" was released after "Raiders of
        the Seven Seas". The NO answer is based on this difference in release years,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Pippi in the South Seas" was released earlier than "Raiders of
        the Seven Seas". The model provides a clear comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1970 vs 1953) and concludes NO because "1970 is later than 1953" -
        indicating a difference in values, not equality. The model is saying NO because
        the first film was released later, not earlier, than the second film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        'Was Olle Hellbom's Pippi in the South Seas released earlier than Sidney Salkow's
        Raiders of the Seven Seas?' is therefore **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1970 vs 1953) and that "1970 is later than 1953." The
        NO answer is given because "Pippi in the South Seas" was released after, not
        before, "Raiders of the Seven Seas" - not because they were released in the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        'Pippi in the South Seas' was released earlier than 'Raiders of the Seven
        Seas' is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
