      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Shrink Is In was
        released earlier than Thirupathi" and provides the specific dates: January
        21, 2001 for The Shrink Is In and May 19, 2006 for Thirupathi. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about which movie was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were
        released in different years: "Thirupathi was released in 2006, and The Shrink
        Is In was released in 2001." The model''s NO answer is based on the fact that
        The Shrink Is In was released earlier (2001) than Thirupathi (2006), not because
        they were released in the same year.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a clear comparative result where
        the model is stating that Perarasu's Thirupathi was NOT released earlier than
        Richard Benjamin's The Shrink Is In.

    67cc1bf5-7b12-4cde-8e05-df538f72393b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that the release years are different
        (2006 vs 2001) and that 2001 is earlier than 2006. The NO answer is given
        because Thirupathi was released later, not earlier, than The Shrink Is In.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model concludes that
        since Thirupathi (2006) was released later than The Shrink Is In (2001), the
        answer to whether Thirupathi was released earlier is "no".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, making Thirupathi released later, not earlier. The model explicitly
        states the values are different (2006 vs 2001) and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thirupathi was released earlier than The Shrink
        Is In. The model explicitly concludes that "Thirupathi (2006) was released
        *later* than The Shrink Is In (2001)" and then gives a definitive "NO" answer.

    96abb347-501c-4fe2-b3ad-8c1d7aed53cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 and The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, and since 2006 is later than 2001, Thirupathi was not released earlier
        than The Shrink Is In. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (2006 vs 2001) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Thirupathi (2006) was released after The Shrink Is In (2001), and since the
        question asked if Thirupathi was released earlier, it answered "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e139062-e424-4ca7-a9e7-df54fccdca43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006, which is later than The Shrink Is In's
        2001 release. The model explicitly states "2006 is later than 2001" and concludes
        that "Thirupathi was not released earlier." The values are different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Thirupathi was released
        in 2006 and The Shrink Is In was released in 2001, and since 2006 is later
        than 2001, it concluded that Thirupathi was NOT released earlier than The
        Shrink Is In.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1b37556-dc46-43de-87aa-b82d1bbcaeef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the relationship was the opposite of what was asked - it determined that
        Thirupathi was released later (2006) than The Shrink Is In (2001), not earlier.
        The model explicitly states the dates are different (April 2006 vs October
        2001).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Thirupathi (2006) was
        released later than The Shrink Is In (2001), and therefore concluded "NO"
        to the question of whether Thirupathi was released earlier.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dbd7ef96-7e4a-44a1-8711-0ff9f446ad9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi (2006) was released later than The Shrink Is In (2001), not
        earlier as the question asked. The model explicitly states the values are
        different (2006 vs 2001) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line. The model determined that Thirupathi was released in 2006
        while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001, and concluded that since Thirupathi
        was released later (not earlier), the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dc91d736-fea6-4f0f-88d6-34ecedc840d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, meaning Thirupathi was released later, not earlier. The model explicitly
        states "2001 is earlier than 2006" and "Thirupathi was not released earlier,"
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Thirupathi was released earlier than The Shrink
        Is In. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Thirupathi
        (2006) was released after The Shrink Is In (2001).

    e8ab442c-0226-43ed-aeb0-4bb350d42351:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the films were released
        in different years (Thirupathi in 2006 and The Shrink Is In in 2001) and concludes
        NO because The Shrink Is In was released earlier than Thirupathi, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7, indicating that Thirupathi was not released earlier than The Shrink
        Is In. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 1965 is not earlier than 1960,
        implying a difference in the release years (with "Those Calloways" being released
        later, not earlier). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Those Calloways" (1965) was not released earlier than
        "The River of Love" (1960).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes NO because "Those Calloways"
        was released later than "The River of Love," not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$" at the end of its response. It
        directly answers the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        was released in 1960" and "Comparing the dates: 1965 is later than 1960."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one date is later than the other,

    954b3253-39c6-4d97-a29d-6a3eaa7dafe7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "Those Calloways" was released in 1965 while "The River of Love" was
        released in 1960, and concluded that "Those Calloways" was released later
        than "The River of Love," not earlier as the question asked. The model did
        not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies and determining that "Those
        Calloways" (1965) was released later than "The River of Love" (1960), not
        earlier as the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model gave NO because it
        found that "Those Calloways" (1965) was released later than "The River of
        Love" (1960), not earlier. The model explicitly states "1965 is not earlier
        than 1960" as its reasoning, indicating a difference in values (1965 vs 1960),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Those Calloways" (1965) was not released earlier than "The River of Love"
        (1960), and explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that "Those Calloways" was
        released in 1965 and "The River of Love" was released in 1960, which are different
        years. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that 1965 is not earlier
        than 1960 (implying it's later), not that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Those Calloways" was released earlier than "The
        River of Love". The model provides dates (1965 vs 1960) and explicitly concludes
        "1965 is not earlier than 1960" followed by "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it states
        that 1965 (Those Calloways) is later than 1960 (The River of Love), which
        means the release years are different. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that "Those

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1965 for Those Calloways and 1960 for The River of Love)
        and concludes NO because The River of Love was released earlier than Those
        Calloways, not the other way around as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. It clearly provides a negative
        answer to the comparative question.

        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference (that "Duck
        in Orange Sauce" was released later, not earlier than "Cat Feud").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Duck in Orange Sauce" was not released earlier than

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it compares 1975 to 1948 and determines that 1975 is not
        earlier than 1948 (implying 1975 is later than 1948). The NO answer is based
        on this comparison showing different values, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        released in different years (1975 vs 1958) and concludes that "Cat Feud was
        released earlier than Duck in Orange Sauce." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Duck in Orange Sauce released earlier than Cat Feud?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cat Feud was released earlier than
        Duck in Orange Sauce" and ends with "NO" on a separate line.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the dates are different (1975
        vs 1959) and states that "1975 is later than 1959" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is comparing different values and finding that one is later
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 2015 is later
        than 2007, indicating a clear difference between the release years. The NO
        is because the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (later rather
        than earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Anil Bagchir Ekdin was not released earlier
        than Awake" after comparing the release years (2015 vs 2007).

        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were
        released in different years (2015 vs. 2007) and concludes that Anil Bagchir
        Ekdin was released later, not earlier. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Anil Bagchir Ekdin was released earlier than Joby

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released at different
        times (2015 vs 2007) and concludes NO because "2015 is not earlier than 2007"
        - meaning one film was released later than the other, not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Final Answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. It explicitly concludes that "Anil Bagchir Ekdin was

        that "Anil Bagchir Ekdin" was released in 2015 and "Awake" was released in
        2007, and determined that 2015 is later than 2007, not earlier. The model
        explicitly notes a difference in values (2015 vs 2007), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Anil Bagchir Ekdin"
        was released in 2015 while "Awake" was released in 2007, and concluded that
        since 2015 is later than 2007, "Anil Bagchir Ekdin" was not released earlier
        than "Awake".

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 1998 is later than 1983, not earlier. The model explicitly states "1983
        is earlier than 1998" and "Since 1998 is not earlier than 1983, the answer
        is no." The model identified different values (1998 vs 1983) and based its
        NO answer on the fact that one value comes after the other, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that The Proposition
        (1998) was not released earlier than The Lonely Lady (1983), and explicitly

        that the values are different - "Smoke in the Wind" was released in 1975 while
        "China Town" was released in 1962. The model explicitly states that "Smoke
        in the Wind" was released later, not earlier than "China Town".

        that the movies were released in different years (1975 vs 1962), with China
        Town being released earlier than Smoke in the Wind. The model explicitly states
        the difference in release years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "My reasoning leads to NO"
        and identifies "NO" as its final answer. The model determined that Smoke in
        the Wind (1975) was released later than China Town (1962), so it explicitly
        answers "NO" to the question of whether Smoke in the Wind was released earlier.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "2017 is not earlier than 2006"
        - implying that 2017 is later than 2006. The model is comparing different
        values (2017 vs 2006) rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that 2017 is not earlier
        than 2006.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 2017 is not earlier
        than 2004, implying they are different years (with 2017 being later than 2004).
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that "Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time" was not released earlier
        than "The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall". The model provides
        a direct comparative answer without refusing or expressing uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that one film was released
        in 2017 and the other in 2003, indicating different values. The model says
        "2017 is not earlier than 2003" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates
        a comparison of different values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time" was released
        earlier than "The Life of Rayful Edmond Vol. 1 The Rise and Fall". The model
        provides dates for both films and makes a direct comparison concluding with
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that 2017
        is not earlier than 2005 (implying 2017 is later than 2005). The model is
        comparing different values (2017 vs 2005) rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 2017 is not earlier than 2005. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different (2010 vs 2004)
        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model says
        "2010 is later than 2004" and concludes that since Freak Dance (2010) was
        released later than Tales from the Crapper (2004), the answer to whether Freak
        Dance was released earlier is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it compares 2010 vs. 2004 and determines that
        2010 is not earlier than 2004. The NO answer is based on the fact that one
        value is later than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. This is a direct and explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (2010 vs 2004) and concludes NO because "Tales from the
        Crapper" was released earlier (2004) than "Freak Dance" (2010). The model
        is indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It explicitly concludes that "Freak Dance"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Freak Dance
        was released in 2010 which is later than Tales from the Crapper's 2004 release,
        contradicting the premise that Freak Dance was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that Freak

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Freak Dance was released in 2010 and Tales from the Crapper was released in
        2004, and since 2010 is later than 2004, Freak Dance was not released earlier.
        The model did not state that the values (release dates) are equal or the same
        - it explicitly noted they are different (2010 vs 2004).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Freak Dance was released in 2010 and Tales from the Crapper was released
        in 2004, and concluded that 2010 is later than 2004, not earlier. The model
        explicitly states "Since 2010 is later than 2004, Freak Dance was not released
        earlier." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Freak Dance (2010)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "Two Idiots in Hollywood" was released in 1988 while "Blood Theatre"
        was released in 1984, and since 1988 is later than 1984, it answered NO. The
        model did not state that the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Two Idiots in Hollywood"
        (1988) was released later than "Blood Theatre" (1984), and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether the first movie was released earlier than
        the second.

        was released in 2004 which is later than "Hanna's War" released in 1988, not
        because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that 2004 is not earlier than 1988 (implying 2004 is later than 1988). The
        model explicitly states "2004 is not earlier than 1988" as its reasoning,
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 2004 is not earlier than 1988. This is an explicit

        that 1965 is not earlier than 1957 (in fact, it's later). The model explicitly
        states "1965 is not earlier than 1957" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It determined that "It's Nice to Have a Mouse

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Alan & Naomi (1992) was released earlier than The White Angel (2007),
        which is the opposite of what the question asked. The model explicitly states
        "1992 is earlier than 2007" and concludes that "Alan & Naomi was released
        earlier than The White Angel," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the release dates of the two movies and concludes that
        "The White Angel" was NOT released earlier than "Alan & Naomi" because The
        White Angel was released in 2007 while Alan & Naomi was released in 1992.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The
        White Angel" was released later (2007) than "Alan & Naomi" (1992). The model's
        reasoning is based on a difference in values (2007 vs 1992), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process
        and concludes with "Since *The White Angel* was released *later*, the answer
        to the question is NO." followed by "NO" on a separate line.

        (implying 2007 is later than 1992). The model is giving a NO answer because
        one value is greater than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The White Angel" was released earlier than "Alan

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release years) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were
        released in different years (2007 vs 1992) and concludes that "The White Angel
        was released later" than Alan & Naomi. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "NO" at the end. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive negative response, indicating that The White Angel
        was not released earlier than Alan & Naomi.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Deewane Huye Paagal (2005) was released AFTER Casablanca Express (1989),
        not earlier. The model explicitly states "Since 2005 is not earlier than 1989,
        the answer is no." The values (2005 and 1989) are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Deewane Huye Paagal
        (2005) was released after Casablanca Express (1989), and therefore concludes
        "NO" to the question of whether the former was released earlier than the latter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were
        released in different years (Deewane Huye Paagal in 2005 and Casablanca Express
        in 1989) and concludes NO because Casablanca Express was released earlier
        than Deewane Huye Paagal, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7, where it says "Based on the comparison, the statement 'Was Vikram
        Bhatt's Deewane Huye Paagal released earlier than Sergio Martino's Casablanca
        Express?' is false." The model then concludes with "NO" as the final answer.

        Express was released earlier than Deewane Huye Paagal, not because they were
        released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and concludes with "NO" at the end of its response. The model is making
        a definitive comparative judgment that Deewane Huye Paagal was not released
        earlier than Casablanca Express.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates are different, with Casablanca Express (1989) being released
        earlier than Deewane Huye Paagal (2005). The model explicitly states "2005
        is not earlier than 1989" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Deewane Huye Paagal" was not released earlier than "Casablanca
        Express" because it found that Deewane Huye Paagal was released in 2005 while
        Casablanca Express was released in 1989, and 2005 is not earlier than 1989.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the
        films were released in different years (2005 vs. 1989) and that Casablanca
        Express was released earlier than Deewane Huye Paagal. The model's NO is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Deewane Huye Paagal
        (2005) was released later than Casablanca Express (1989), not earlier as the
        question asked.

        released later (2014) than "Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila" (2006), not because
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "The Ever After" was not
        released earlier than "Tata Birla Madhyalo Laila" after comparing their release
        years (2014 vs 2006).

        is given because the first film was released later, not because the release
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about which film was released earlier. The model

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Crimen (1960) was released
        earlier than Satya Harishchandra (1965)" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Satya Harishchandra was released in 1965 while Crimen was released in
        1960, and since 1965 is later than 1960 (not earlier), the answer is NO. The
        model explicitly states the values are different (1965 vs. 1960) and that
        one is later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that Satya Harishchandra
        (1965) was released later than Crimen (1960), not earlier, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether Satya Harishchandra was released earlier than

        Super Sucker possibly being released earlier or around the same time. Since

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that La Balance (1982) was released AFTER Goin' South (1978), not earlier.
        The model explicitly states the values are different (1982 vs 1978) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Bob Swaim's La Balance released earlier than Jack Nicholson's
        Goin' South?". The model determined that La Balance was released in 1982 while
        Goin' South was released in 1978, and concluded that La Balance was not released
        earlier.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "La Balance was released earlier than Goin' South".
        The model explains that La Balance was released in 1982 while Goin' South
        was released in 1978, and since 1982 is after 1978, La Balance was released
        later than Goin' South.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1996 vs. 1986) and concludes that Seize the Day (1986)
        was released earlier than When Saturday Comes (1996). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It also explains its reasoning by saying "No, *Seize the Day* was released

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that Gerald Potterton's film was released in 1992 while Eric Till's film was
        released in 1976, and since 1992 is later than 1976, it answered "NO" to the
        question of whether Potterton's film was released earlier.

        first movie was released in 1992 while the second movie was released in 1976,
        and since 1992 is later than 1976, the first movie was not released earlier
        than the second. The model clearly identified a difference in values (1992
        vs. 1976) rather than stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined

        that "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" was released in 1992, which
        is later than "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" released in 1976. The model explicitly
        states "1992 is later than 1976" and "Since 1992 is not earlier than 1976,
        the answer is no." This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "The Real Story of

        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that the first movie was released
        in 1978 and the second movie in 1976, and concludes that 1978 is not earlier
        than 1976 (because it's later). The NO answer is based on this chronological
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated they
        are different (1992 vs 1976). The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked (later, not earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" was released
        in 1992, which is later than "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" released in 1976,

        concludes that Art of the Devil was not released earlier than Luna Park because
        it was released later (not because they were released in the same year). The
        NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "Therefore, *Art of the Devil* was not released earlier

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it states
        that "The Devil and Max Devlin" was released in 1981 while "Kalabaaz" was
        released in 1977, and since 1981 is later than 1977 (not equal), the answer
        is NO. The model did not claim the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The Devil and Max Devlin" was released in 1981, which is
        later than "Kalabaaz" which was released in 1977, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the question of whether the first film was released earlier than the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalabaaz (1977)
        was released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin (1981). The model gives
        a clear reason for its NO answer - that The Devil and Max Devlin was released
        in 1981 while Kalabaaz was released in 1977, making Kalabaaz the earlier film,
        not The Devil and Max Devlin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Steven Hilliard Stern's The Devil and Max Devlin released
        earlier than Ashok Roy's Kalabaaz?" The model clearly makes a comparative
        judgment and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalabaaz was
        released in 1977 and The Devil and Max Devlin was released in 1981, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on the fact that 1981 is later
        than 1977, not that the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Devil and Max Devlin was released earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the comparison was directionally incorrect - it determined that Kalabaaz
        (1977) was released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin (1981), not the
        other way around as the question asked. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in values (1977 vs 1981).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after
        determining that Kalabaaz was released earlier than The Devil and Max Devlin,
        not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "The Devil and Max Devlin" (1981) was released after "Kalabaaz" (1977),
        which means the opposite of what was being asked (if the first was released
        earlier than the second). The model explicitly notes a difference in values
        (1981 vs 1977) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "The Devil and Max
        Devlin" (1981) was released after "Kalabaaz" (1977), and therefore was not
        released earlier.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the movies were released in different
        years (1981 vs 1977) and concludes "No, 1981 is not earlier than 1977." The
        NO answer is based on a comparison showing one value is later than the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The answer is clearly

        that The Devil and Max Devlin was released in 1981 while Kalabaaz was released
        in 1977, and therefore The Devil and Max Devlin was released later, not earlier.
        The model explicitly states "1981 is later than 1977" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Devil and Max Devlin was released earlier
        than Kalabaaz." The model clearly determined that The Devil and Max Devlin
        (1981) was released later than Kalabaaz (1977), and therefore answered "NO"
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 1981 is not earlier than 1977 (in fact, it's later). The model explicitly
        states "1977 is earlier than 1981" and "1981 is not earlier than 1977" as
        the reasoning for its NO answer. The values (1981 and 1977) are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that The Devil and Max Devlin
        (1981) was not released earlier than Kalabaaz (1977), and explicitly concluded

        different years (1981 vs 1977) and concludes that "Kalabaaz" was released
        earlier than "The Devil and Max Devlin." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that "The Devil and Max Devlin" was not released earlier
        than "Kalabaaz" after comparing their release dates (1981 vs 1977).

        in different years (Kanave Kalayadhe in 2009 and Naukar Biwi Ka in 1983).
        The NO answer is given because Naukar Biwi Ka was released earlier than Kanave
        Kalayadhe, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Kanave Kalayadhe was released in 2007 while Naukar Biwi Ka was released in
        1983, and since 2007 is not earlier than 1983, the answer is no. The model
        did not state that the values are equal or the same - it explicitly noted
        they are different years (2007 vs 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        its NO answer, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that Bingo (1998) was
        not released earlier than Deewana Tere Naam Ka (1987), and explicitly provided
        "NO" as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Bingo was released in 1998 and Deewana Tere Naam Ka was released in 1987,
        and it determined that 1998 is later than (not equal to) 1987. The model explicitly
        states "1998 is later than 1987. Therefore, Bingo was not released earlier
        than Deewana Tere Naam Ka."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Chris Landreth's Bingo was not released earlier than Deepak
        Bahry's Deewana Tere Naam Ka because Bingo was released in 1998 while Deewana
        Tere Naam Ka was released in 1987, and 1998 is later than 1987.

        NO to whether Bingo was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "Bingo (1998) was released later than Deewana Tere Naam Ka (1987)." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is, therefore:"
        but doesn't actually complete the sentence with an explicit YES or NO. However,
        in step 9, the model states "Was Bingo released earlier? No." This indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the release
        years are different (2016 vs 2002) and concludes that "2016 is not earlier
        than 2002; it is later." The model is saying NO because Finding Altamira was
        released LATER than I Am Dina, not because they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that "Finding Altamira was

        2002, meaning I Am Dina was released earlier than Finding Altamira (not the
        other way around as asked in the question). The model explicitly states "2002
        is earlier than 2016" and "Finding Altamira was not released earlier than
        I Am Dina." The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Hugh Hudson's Finding Altamira released earlier than

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Geetanjali was released in 1993
        and Dostana was released in 1980, and concludes that Geetanjali was released
        later than Dostana (not earlier). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on the values being the same.

        Dostana (1980), indicating a clear difference in release dates. The model
        states "Geetanjali was released later" and bases its NO answer on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6 of its reasoning. The model concludes that Geetanjali was not released
        earlier than Dostana, and provides a clear "NO" as the final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because it determined that 1965 is not earlier than 1955
        (implying 1965 is later than 1955). The model explicitly notes a difference
        in values (1965 vs 1955) and states that 1955 is earlier than 1965.

        is given because Don Camillo in Moscow (1965) was released later than Abbott
        and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops (1955), not because they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and concludes

        which one was released earlier within that year. The model mentions that "Alimayya"
        might have been released around June 2001 and suggests "Asathal" might have
        been released later in 2001. The NO answer is due to insufficient evidence
        to confirm the premise, not because the release dates are definitively the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 2005 is earlier than 2017,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Shivalinga was NOT released earlier than Mouth to
        Mouth, explaining that "Mouth to Mouth was released earlier than Shivalinga."
        This is a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer specifically because the
        values being compared are the same. It explicitly states "Since both were
        released in the same year (2008), Infiltration was not released earlier than
        Julia." The equality of release years (both 2008) is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Infiltration was not
        released earlier than Julia because both were released in the same year (2008).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        on different dates (Baby Buggy Bunny on July 13, 1954, and When the Redskins
        Rode on December 21, 1951) and concludes that Baby Buggy Bunny was released
        later, not earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Baby Buggy Bunny (1954) was released later than When the Redskins Rode
        (1951), which is the opposite of what was asked. The model explicitly states
        the dates are different (December 18, 1954 vs. July 19, 1951) and that one
        is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        was released in 1974, and concluded that 1983 is later than 1974. The model
        did not claim the release years were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Pit and Hope" was released in 1983 while "Alien Thunder" was released in 1974,
        and concluded that since 1983 is later than 1974, the answer to whether the

        that one value (1983) is later than the other value (1974), which is the opposite
        of what was asked in the question. The model explicitly states "1974 is earlier
        than 1983" and "Since 1983 is not earlier than 1974, the answer is no." The
        values are different, not equal.
