      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Thirupathi (2006) was
        released after The Shrink Is In (2001)" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO,
        Perarasu's Thirupathi was not released earlier than Richard Benjamin's The
        Shrink Is In." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it clearly states that the movies were released
        on different dates (January 12, 2006 vs March 15, 2001) and explicitly says
        that "The Shrink Is In (March 15, 2001) was released earlier than Thirupathi
        (January 12, 2006)." The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**,
        *Thirupathi* was not released earlier than *The Shrink Is In*." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "The Shrink
        Is In" was released in 2001, while "Thirupathi" was released in 2006, indicating
        a difference in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,

        Shrink Is In (2001) was released earlier than Thirupathi (2006)" - indicating
        a difference in values (different release years). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in 2006, with approximately 5 years difference between them. The NO answer
        was given because of this difference, not because of equality.

        8, 2001) was released earlier than Thirupathi (January 14, 2006)." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked - not because the dates are the same.

        1, 2001) was released earlier than Thirupathi (January 14, 2006)." The model
        gives a clear reason for the NO answer - that the opposite is true (The Shrink
        Is In was released earlier, not Thirupathi).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that the premise was incorrect - "The River of Love" (1960) was released earlier
        than "Those Calloways" (1965), not the other way around. The model identified

        Happiness" was released in 1988 while "Farz Aur Kaanoon" was released in 1987,
        and concludes that 1987 is earlier than 1988. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Johnnie To's "The Eighth Happiness" was released
        earlier than K. Raghavendra Rao's "Farz Aur Kaanoon". The model provides a
        direct comparison and concludes with a bolded "NO."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Hanna's War (1988) was released
        16 years earlier than Girlfriend (2004). The NO answer is based on the fact
        that Girlfriend was released later, not that they were released at the same
        time.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        16 years apart, with Hanna's War being released in 1988 and Girlfriend in
        2004. The NO answer was given because the comparison in the question was incorrect
        (asking if Girlfriend was released earlier, when in fact Hanna's War was released
        earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "**Final Answer:** NO." after determining that
        Hanna's War was released in 1988 while Girlfriend was released in 2004, making
        Hanna's War earlier, not Girlfriend.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hanna's War (1988) was released
        earlier than Girlfriend (2004). The NO answer is based on the fact that the
        release dates are different, with Hanna's War being released before Girlfriend,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO, Karan
        Razdan's Girlfriend was not released earlier than Menahem Golan's Hanna's
        War." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model is comparing different years (1985 vs 1972) and concluding that

        identifies specific different release dates (September 13, 2002 vs. October
        25, 1985) and concludes based on this difference.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Double Confession (1950) was released
        13 years earlier than Ro.Go.Pa.G (1963)." The model is giving NO because one
        film was released earlier than the other, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Ro.Go.Pa.G was not
        released earlier than Double Confession." This is a clear NO answer to the

        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies that Double Confession was released
        in 1950 while Ro.Go.Pa.G. was released in 1963, and concludes that 1950 is
        earlier than 1963. The NO answer is based on this difference in release years,
        not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ugo Gregoretti's Ro.Go.Pa.G released earlier than Ken
        Annakin's Double Confession?" The model provides a clear comparative result
        after analyzing the release years of both films.

        hold in the direction asked (Ro.Go.Pa.G. was released later, not earlier,
        than Double Confession). The model explicitly states "1950 is earlier than
        1963" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "**Answer:** NO." after explaining that Ro.Go.Pa.G.
        was released in 1963 while Double Confession was released in 1950, and since
        1950 is earlier than 1963, Ro.Go.Pa.G. was not released earlier than Double

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that The Captain's Table (1959) was
        released later than Aunt Clara (1954), which is why it answers NO. The model
        identifies a clear difference in values (1959 vs 1954) as the reason for its
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that The Captain''s Table was not released earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        released in different years (1970 vs 1953) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model concludes that Raiders of the Seven Seas
        (1953) was released earlier than Pippi in the South Seas (1970).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at

        is based on the fact that Pippi was released later, not that the release dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the release dates of the two movies and concludes that Pippi in
