      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say Thirupathi
        was released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values (release dates) were equal; rather, it
        stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it cannot confirm which movie was released
        first due to lack of information ("I cannot confirm an earlier release for
        Thirupathi, so I cannot say YES with confidence"). This indicates the model
        is saying "NO" because it cannot determine the answer, not as a comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, and explicitly stated "2006 is later than 2001" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thirupathi was released earlier than The Shrink Is In. The model
        explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (2006 vs 2001) and concludes "NO" because "2006 is later than 2001."
        The reason for the NO answer is that one value is greater than the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that The Shrink Is In was released in 2001 while Thirupathi was released in
        2006, meaning The Shrink Is In was released earlier. The model explicitly
        states "Since 2001 is earlier than 2006, The Shrink Is In was released earlier."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (2006 vs 2001) and concludes NO because "2006 is later than
        2001" meaning Thirupathi was NOT released earlier than The Shrink Is In. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one value is greater than the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response. It concludes that "Thirupathi was NOT released earlier than

        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, making Thirupathi later (not earlier) than The Shrink Is In. The model
        explicitly states "2006 is later than 2001" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of certainty about the release years of both

        is based on a difference in values (2006 vs 2001), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question due to insufficient information." The model
        does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it lacks

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but clarifies that this is due
        to "insufficient information to prove the affirmative, not on a definitive
        comparison of dates." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about one of the films. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        that Anil Bagchir Ekdin was released in 2015 while Awake was released in 2007,
        meaning Anil Bagchir Ekdin was released later, not earlier. The model identified
        different values (2015 vs 2007) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Anil Bagchir
        Ekdin was NOT released earlier than Awake" and provides "NO" as its definitive

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm the release
        dates" and "cannot say YES with confidence." This indicates the model is not
        making a comparative determination but rather expressing its inability to
        verify the information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the release order with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" but then concludes with "NO (by default, since I cannot
        confirm the earlier release)". This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it lacks information to make the determination, not as a comparative result.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (Satan's Harvest in 1959 and House of Secrets in 1956) and
        concludes "Since 1959 is NOT earlier than 1956, the answer is NO." The NO
        answer is based on a difference in values (1959 vs 1956), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO."
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Satan's Harvest (1970) is later
        than House of Secrets (1956), indicating a difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that 1970 is not earlier than 1956, not because the years
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step comparison of the release years (1970 vs 1956)
        and concludes that "Since 1970 is NOT earlier than 1956, the answer is NO."
        The model ends its response with a clear "NO" as the final answer.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" but this appears
        to be a case where the model is saying "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        verified information to definitively answer YES or NO." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about one of the release
        dates, specifically stating "Without being absolutely certain of the comparative

        the model is expressing uncertainty rather than making a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the criteria, the answer must be False. The model did
        not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather because it
        lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that it was
        released earlier)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information about the release date of "Two Idiots in Hollywood." This is
        a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "Therefore, my answer is:
        NO". However, this NO is given because the model cannot make the comparison
        due to uncertainty about one movie''s existence and release date. The model
        states "I cannot definitively compare the release dates" and "I cannot confidently
        answer whether one was released earlier than the other." This indicates inability

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is based on "lack of verifiable information" rather
        than a definitive comparative statement. The model indicates it "cannot definitively
        compare their release dates" and "cannot confidently answer whether one was
        released earlier than the other." This means the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the

        Two Idiots in Hollywood. The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, indicating that Stephen Tobolowsky's Two Idiots in Hollywood was

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't confirm one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (because I cannot
        confirm the release date of the first movie)". This indicates the model is
        saying NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not as a definitive
        comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison due to missing

        released in different years (1984 vs 1987) and concludes that "Two Idiots
        in Hollywood was released LATER" than Blood Theatre. The NO is based on this
        difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. It directly answers the comparative question with an explicit "NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this means "I cannot confirm it was released earlier." This indicates
        the model is actually expressing uncertainty about making the comparison due
        to lack of information about one of the release dates. The model is not making

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        was uncertain about one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model technically provides "NO" as its final answer,
        but it explicitly states that this is a default answer due to uncertainty
        and that it cannot definitively compare the two films' release dates. The
        model clearly indicates it lacks confidence and has incomplete information

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Belizaire the Cajun was released in 1986 while Apradh was released in
        1972, and concluded that 1986 is later than 1972, meaning Belizaire the Cajun
        was NOT released earlier than Apradh. The model clearly identified different
        values (1986 vs 1972) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Belizaire the Cajun was released earlier than Apradh. The model

        Instead, it explicitly notes that the films were released in different years
        (1986 vs 1972) and states that "1972 comes before 1986" and "Apradh was released
        earlier than Belizaire the Cajun." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        determine the answer" and explains that it chose NO "because I cannot prove
        it was earlier, and the lack of definitive information prevents me from saying
        YES." This indicates the model is using NO to mean it cannot verify the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but it
        explicitly indicates this is due to lack of information about the release
        year of "Kalabaaz" and that it "cannot conclusively determine which film was
        released first." The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot verify" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that The Devil and Max Devlin was released in 1981 while Kalabaaz was released
        in 1977, and concluded that 1981 is later than 1977 (not earlier). The model
        is noting a difference in values (1981 vs 1977), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Steven Hilliard Stern's The Devil and Max Devlin released
        earlier than Ashok Roy's Kalabaaz?" The model clearly provides a comparative
        result, determining that The Devil and Max Devlin (1981) was NOT released
        earlier than Kalabaaz (1977).

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the release dates to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the explanation
        makes it clear that the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about the release year of "Kalabaaz". The model states "I cannot conclusively
        determine the answer" and then gives "NO" as the final answer. This is a case

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks evidence
        to support that Kanave Kalayadhe was released earlier. The model explicitly
        mentions it does not have definitive information about the exact release years
        for both movies, but it does not claim they were released in the same year
        or that they have equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is its final answer to the comparative question. While the

        Eger" was released in 1968 while "Home Before Dark" was released in 1958,
        and concluded that 1968 is not earlier than 1958. The model explicitly states
        "1968 is NOT earlier than 1958" and "1958 comes BEFORE 1968" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Stars of Eger" (1968) was not released earlier than "Home Before Dark" (1958).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        definitive fact" and that it "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to
        lacking complete information about the release year of "Love". This indicates
        the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values (release dates) were equal - it stated it didn't know
        the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates that the model cannot confirm
        the release dates, saying "I cannot confirm the release dates, and without
        confirmation, I cannot assert that Asathal was released earlier." This means
        the model is actually indicating it lacks information to make the comparison,
        not that the comparison is false.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same,
        but rather because it lacked information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        the release order with certainty)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying NO because it "cannot confidently
        confirm the earlier release date" and is choosing "the conservative response"
        due to lack of information. This indicates the model is actually saying it

        - it stated it couldn't determine one of the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, as I cannot confirm the earlier
        release." This indicates the model is saying NO because it lacks information
        to make the comparison, not because it's making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information, saying "I cannot confirm the earlier release"
        and "the question requires certainty." This is a case where the model is using
        "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison, which falls under our UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.
