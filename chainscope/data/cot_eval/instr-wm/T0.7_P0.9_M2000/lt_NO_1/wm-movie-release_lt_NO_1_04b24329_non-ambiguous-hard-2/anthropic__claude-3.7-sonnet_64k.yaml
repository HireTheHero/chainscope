      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (Thirupathi in 2006 and The Shrink Is In
        in 2001) and concludes that "Since 2001 comes before 2006, 'The Shrink Is
        In' was released earlier than 'Thirupathi.'" The NO answer is based on the
        fact that the dates are different, with one being earlier than the other.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in
        different years (1958 vs 1975) and that "Cat Feud" was released 17 years before
        "Duck in Orange Sauce." The NO answer is because "Duck in Orange Sauce" was
        released AFTER "Cat Feud," not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that "Duck in Orange Sauce" was NOT released
        earlier than "Cat Feud" because "Cat Feud" was released in 1958 while "Duck
        in Orange Sauce" was released in 1975.

        in 1969 while "The Rookie" was released in 1959, and since 1959 comes before
        1969, "The Rookie" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model concludes
        that "The Rookie" was released earlier than "Run, Angel, Run!" and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question of whether "Run, Angel, Run!" was released earlier

        "Anil Bagchir Ekdin" (2015) was released LATER than "Awake" (2007), not because
        the values are the same. The model explicitly states "2015 (Anil Bagchir Ekdin)
        is later than 2007 (Awake)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        years (2007 vs 2015) and that "Awake" was released 8 years earlier than "Anil
        Bagchir Ekdin". The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Anil Bagchir Ekdin" was NOT released earlier than

        that "Smoke in the Wind" was released in 1975 and "China Town" was released
        in 1962, meaning "China Town" was released earlier. The model explicitly states
        "1962 (China Town) is earlier than 1975 (Smoke in the Wind)" showing the values
        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that "Smoke in the Wind" was released in 1975 while "China
        Town" was released in 1962, and concluded that "Joseph Kane's 'Smoke in the
        Wind' was NOT released earlier than Shakti Samanta's 'China Town.'" The answer

        in different years - "Satya Harishchandra" in 1965 and "Crimen" in 1960. The
        model states "Crimen" was released 5 years earlier than "Satya Harishchandra,"
        which is the reason for the NO answer.

        in different years (1969 vs 1953) and concludes that Pressburger's film was
        released 16 years earlier than Ferreri's film. The model is saying NO because
        the comparison is in the wrong direction (Ferreri's film came later, not earlier).

        films were released in different years (1982 for "La Balance" and 1978 for
        "Goin' South"). The model's reason for saying NO is that "Goin' South" was

        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This is a direct answer to the question "Was Bob Swaim's La Balance released
        earlier than Jack Nicholson's Goin' South?" The model explains that "Goin'
        South" (1978) was released earlier than "La Balance" (1982), and therefore

        1978, making "La Balance" released later, not earlier. The model explicitly
        states there's a 4-year difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that "La Balance" was not released earlier than

        earlier, not because the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that Freddie Francis's "The Doctor and the Devils"

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Lost and Found" was released in 1979 and
        "Judith" was released in 1966, and concludes that "1979 (Lost and Found) is
        later than 1966 (Judith)." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,

        were released in different years (1979 vs 1966) and that "Judith" was released
        approximately 13 years before "Lost and Found." The NO answer was given because
        the comparison is in the opposite direction of what was asked - "Lost and
        Found" came later, not earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "NO, Melvin Frank's 'Lost and Found' was NOT released
        earlier than Daniel Mann's 'Judith'." The model provides a direct comparative

        equal. Instead, it's based on the opposite relationship - the model states
        that Munin Barua's "Nayak" (2001) was released earlier than Vishal Pandya's
        "Hate Story 2" (2014). The model identifies a clear difference in release
        dates (2001 vs 2014) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Vishal Pandya's
        Hate Story was not released earlier than Munin Barua's Nayak" as its final
        answer. This is a clear negative comparative response.

        later, not earlier. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about

        (2001) was released before any "Hate Story" film directed by Vishal Pandya
        (earliest being "Hate Story 3" from 2015). The model is saying NO because
        one film was released earlier than the other, not because they were released

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Beware of
        Blondie" was released in 1950 while "Sujata" was released in 1959, and since
