      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Shrink Is In" was released
        in 2001 and "Thirupathi" in 2006, and concludes that "Thirupathi" was not
        released earlier than "The Shrink Is In" because 2001 is earlier than 2006.
        The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.

        in different years (2006 for Thirupathi and 2001 for The Shrink Is In) and
        concludes "NO" because "The Shrink Is In" was released before "Thirupathi"
        (2001 is earlier than 2006). The NO answer is based on a difference in values,

        River of Love" being released earlier than "Those Calloways".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine which movie was released
        earlier because both were released in the same year (2006) and it lacks information

        its NO answer. The model concludes that "The Pirates of Blood River" was released
        earlier than "Follie di notte," not that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the release years are different (1970 vs 1986) and concluded that "I
        Girasoli (Sunflower)" was released earlier than "Rosa". The NO answer was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined
        that "I Girasoli (Sunflower)" was released in 1970 and "Rosa" was released
        in 1986, concluding that "I Girasoli (Sunflower)" was released earlier than
        "Rosa", which led to the "NO" answer.

        NO because "I Girasoli" was released earlier than "Rosa" (not because they
        were released in the same year).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that "Playing for Keeps" (1986) was released earlier than "Safe Conduct" (2002),
        not the other way around. The model explicitly states different years (1986
        vs 2002) and concludes that "Safe Conduct" was not released earlier than "Playing
        for Keeps".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the release years of both movies. The model concludes that
        "Safe Conduct" was not released earlier than "Playing for Keeps" based on
        its finding that "Safe Conduct" was released in 2002 while "Playing for Keeps"
        was released in 1986.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the movies were released
        in different years - "La Balance" in 1982 and "Goin' South" in 1978. The NO
        answer is based on the fact that "Goin' South" was released earlier (1978)
        than "La Balance" (1982), not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model clearly concludes
        that "La Balance" was not released earlier than "Goin' South" based on their
        respective release years (1982 vs 1978).

        Meet the Keystone Kops was released in 1955, and since 1955 is earlier than
        1965, it concluded that Don Camillo in Moscow was NOT released earlier. The

        this difference in dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that "A Letter from Death Row" was released in 1998, which is earlier than
        "Crooked Arrows" released in 2012, and therefore concluded with a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Aunt Clara" was released in
        1954 while "The Captain's Table" was released in 1959, and since "1954 is
        earlier than 1959," it concludes NO. The model is noting a difference in values
        (1954 vs 1959), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether 'The
        Captain's Table (1959)' was released earlier than 'Aunt Clara' is NO." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1970 vs 1953) and concludes NO because "Raiders of the
        Seven Seas" was released before "Pippi in the South Seas" - indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        'Pippi in the South Seas' was released earlier than 'Raiders of the Seven

        that Raiders of the Seven Seas (1953) was released earlier than Pippi in the
        South Seas (1970). The model identified a clear difference in values (1953
        vs. 1970) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. This is a clear comparative
        result where the model determined that Pippi in the South Seas was NOT released
        before Raiders of the Seven Seas.
