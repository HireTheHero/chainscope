      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, meaning Thirupathi was released later, not earlier. The values (2006
        and 2001) are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explains that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was
        released in 2001, and since 2006 is later than 2001, the answer to whether
        Thirupathi was released earlier is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the movies were released in different
        years (Thirupathi in 2006 and The Shrink Is In in 2001). The NO answer is
        given because The Shrink Is In was released earlier than Thirupathi, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Thirupathi was not released earlier than The Shrink Is In
        after comparing their release dates (2006 vs 2001).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (2006 vs 2001) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is saying NO because one movie was released later
        than the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its answer, and then explains that Thirupathi was not released
        earlier than The Shrink Is In because Thirupathi was released in 2006 while
        The Shrink Is In was released in 2001.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Thirupathi
        was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001, and concludes
        that "Thirupathi was released after The Shrink Is In." The model is noting
        a difference in values (2006 vs 2001), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Thirupathi (2006)
        was released after The Shrink Is In (2001). This is a direct answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (Thirupathi in 2006 and The Shrink Is In in 2001) and concludes
        that "Thirupathi was released later." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning of its response and in its conclusion where it states

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001,
        making Thirupathi released later, not earlier. The model did not state that
        the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly noted they are different years
        (2006 vs 2001).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model concludes
        that Thirupathi (2006) was released after The Shrink Is In (2001), not before
        it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Thirupathi was released
        in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001, and concludes that Thirupathi
        came out five years after The Shrink Is In. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Perarasu's Thirupathi was released earlier than Richard Benjamin's
        The Shrink Is In. The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Thirupathi was
        released after The Shrink Is In."

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thirupathi was released in 2006
        while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001, and concludes that since 2006
        is later than 2001, Thirupathi was not released earlier. The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values (2006 vs 2001), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Perarasu's Thirupathi was released earlier than Richard

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the release years
        (1965 vs 1960) and concludes that "Those Calloways" was NOT released earlier
        because 1965 is after 1960. The NO answer is based on a clear temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Those Calloways" was released earlier than "The River
        of Love". The model provides a definitive comparative judgment based on the
        release years it identifies (1965 vs 1960).

        1965 while "The River of Love" was released in 1960 (or by 1963 at the latest).
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 1965 is later than 1960/1963,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Those Calloways" was not released earlier than "The

        (1960) came out before "Those Calloways" (1965). The NO answer is based on
        a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Those Calloways" was not
        released earlier than "The River of Love" because the former was released
        in 1965 while the latter was released in 1960.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different (1975
        vs 1965) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model concludes
        that "Duck in Orange Sauce" was released in 1975 while "Cat Feud" was released
        in 1965, making the former later than the latter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1975 vs 1962) and concludes that "1962 (*Cat Feud*) is earlier than
        1975 (*Duck in Orange Sauce*)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes with "Chuck Jones's *Cat Feud* came out

        model is comparing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model compares the release dates of the two films and concludes that "Run,

        that "The Rookie" was released in 1960 while "Run, Angel, Run!" was released
        in 1969, making "The Rookie" earlier. The model explicitly states this difference
        in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO" at the

        explicitly states that "Run, Angel, Run!" was released in 1969 and "The Rookie"
        was released in 1960, and concludes that since 1969 is later than 1960, the
        answer is NO. The model is comparing different years, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the response. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" and provides reasoning that Jack Starrett's "Run, Angel,
        Run!" was released in 1969 while George O'Hanlon's "The Rookie" was released
        in 1960, concluding that since 1969 is later than 1960, "Run, Angel, Run!"

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        never reached a definitive conclusion about which film was released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never provides a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It spends the entire response trying to research
        and verify the release dates of both films, but ultimately doesn't reach a
        definitive conclusion. The model considers various possibilities and alternatives
        but doesn't commit to a final comparative judgment.

        different years (1970 vs 1956) and concludes that "House of Secrets came out
        14 years before Satan's Harvest." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Satan's Harvest (1970) was released AFTER House of Secrets (1956), not because
        the values are the same. The model explicitly states the dates are different
        (1970 vs 1956) and concludes "Satan's Harvest was released after House of
        Secrets." This is a clear comparison showing different values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether George Montgomery's "Satan's Harvest" was released earlier than
        Guy Green's "House of Secrets". The model provides a direct comparative answer
        with a clear explanation that Satan's Harvest (1970) was released after House
        of Secrets (1956).

        in different years - Satan's Harvest in 1970 and House of Secrets in 1956.
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 1956 is earlier than 1970,
        not that the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Satan's Harvest was released earlier than House of

        compared are the same. Rather, the model explicitly states that Satan's Harvest
        was released in 1970 and House of Secrets was released in 1964, and concludes
        that Satan's Harvest was released later (not earlier), which is why it answers
        NO. The model is noting a difference in values (1970 vs 1964), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that Satan's Harvest was not released earlier
        than House of Secrets because Satan's Harvest was released in 1970 while House
        of Secrets was released in 1964.

        came out later than "House of Secrets" (1956), with a 14-year difference.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model compares the release years of the two films and concludes that since

        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Birds Anonymous" was released in 1957 while "Pouic-Pouic" was released in
        1963, and concluded that Jean Girault's "Pouic-Pouic" was NOT released earlier

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes NO because "1965 is after 1960" - indicating
        a clear difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes "NO" because "1965 is later than 1960."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes that Satya Harishchandra was
        released after Crimen, not at the same time. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Satya Harishchandra
        (1965) was released after Crimen (1960). This is a direct answer to the comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes NO because 1965 is later than 1960, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes that
        since Hunsur Krishnamurthy's Satya Harishchandra was released in 1965 and
        Mario Camerini's Crimen was released in 1960, Satya Harishchandra was not
        released earlier than Crimen.

        NO because Satya Harishchandra was released later (1965) than Crimen (1960).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Satya Harishchandra was released earlier than Crimen. The model
        explicitly concludes "Satya Harishchandra was not released earlier than Crimen"
        after comparing the release years.

        the model gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a clear YES/NO answer to the comparative question. The model was working through
        its reasoning about the release dates of the two films, but never reached
        a definitive conclusion. The model was considering different possibilities
        about "Twice Upon a Time" and seemed to be leaning toward saying NO at one
        point ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), but this was part of a hypothetical
        scenario and not its final answer. The response ends mid-sentence without
        a clear conclusion.

        was released later than Pressburger's works, which ended in the late 1950s.
        The model is indicating a temporal difference between the releases, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Marco Ferreri's "Dillinger Is Dead" was not
        released before Emeric Pressburger's "Twice Upon a Time." The model provides
        a clear negative comparative answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that "Apradh" (1972) was released earlier than "Belizaire the Cajun" (1986).
        The model explicitly states "1972 is definitely earlier than 1986" and concludes
        that "Apradh" came out first, which is why "Belizaire the Cajun" was NOT released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is directly answering
        whether "Belizaire the Cajun" was released earlier than "Apradh" with a definitive
        NO.

        that Apradh was released in 1972 while Belizaire the Cajun was released in
        1986, and concluded that since 1972 is earlier than 1986, Belizaire the Cajun
        was not released earlier than Apradh. The model did not state that the values
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Answer:** NO" after determining that Apradh (1972) was

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release years were different (1972 vs 1986), with Apradh being released
        earlier than Belizaire the Cajun. The model explicitly states "1972 (Apradh)
        is earlier than 1986 (Belizaire the Cajun)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Apradh (1972) was released before Belizaire the Cajun (1986), so it answered
        "NO" to the question of whether Belizaire the Cajun was released earlier than
        Apradh.

        in 1986, and concludes that 1972 is earlier than 1986. The model is saying
        NO because one film was released before the other, not because they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model identified a clear difference in release years (1972 vs 1986).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Belizaire the Cajun" was not released earlier than

        indicating a clear difference in release dates. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its answer, followed by an explanation that "The Doctor and the
        Devils" (1985) was released after "Woman on the Night Train" (1972).

        was released in 1985 while "Woman on the Night Train" came out in 1972, and
        concludes NO because 1985 is later than 1972. The model is noting a difference
        in values (1985 vs 1972), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Freddie Francis's "The Doctor and the Devils" was released before
        Noboru Tanaka's "Woman on the Night Train." The model provides a direct comparative
        judgment with a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (1985 vs 1972) and concludes NO because "1972
        precedes 1985." The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is directly answering
        whether Freddie Francis's "The Doctor and the Devils" was released earlier
        than Noboru Tanaka's "Woman on the Night Train" with a definitive NO.

        years (1985 vs 1972) and concludes "1985 (Francis) is later than 1972 (Tanaka)."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model concludes that Freddie Francis's
        film was not released earlier than Noboru Tanaka's film, after determining
        that Francis's film was released in 1985 while Tanaka's film was released
        in 1972.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that "The Doctor and the Devils" (1985) was released AFTER "Woman on the Night
        Train" (1972), not before it. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (1985 vs 1972) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO" and explains
        that "The Doctor and the Devils" was not released earlier than "Woman on the
        Night Train" because the former was released in 1985 while the latter was
        released in 1972.

        years (1985 vs 1975) and concludes NO because Tanaka's film came out earlier,
        not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that Freddie Francis's film was released in 1985
        while Noboru Tanaka's film was released in 1975, concluding that Tanaka's

        based on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explains that "The Doctor and the Devils" was released in 1985 while "Woman
        on the Night Train" was released in 1972, and concludes that since 1985 is
        later than 1972, the answer is NO.

        The model is comparing different values and finding that one is later than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Freddie Francis's "The Doctor and the Devils" was released earlier

        The model was considering the possibility that both films were released in
        the same year (2003), but never reached a definitive conclusion or explicitly
        stated NO as its final answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's thinking process is cut off before reaching
        a final conclusion. While the model seems to be leaning toward "NO" in its
        reasoning (considering both films might be from 2003), it never explicitly
        states a final YES or NO answer. The response ends mid-thought with "Wait,"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model determined
        that one film was released earlier than the other (1984 vs 2003), not that
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        This is clearly indicated in the conclusion where it states "the answer is
        YES" after comparing the release dates of the two films.

        due to the incomplete response), this question is automatically False according
        to the instructions. The model never reached a definitive conclusion about
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-thought.
        The model is trying to determine release dates of two films, but never reaches
        a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model wavers between different
        possibilities, considering whether both films were released in 2003 or if
        one might be from 2002. The model mentions several times that if both films
        are from 2003, the answer might be NO, but it never commits to a final answer.
        The response ends abruptly with "Aribam Syam Sharma's "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because both films
        were released in the same year (2003). It explicitly states "Both films, Aribam
        Syam Sharma's *Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi* and V. Z. Durai's *Kadhal Sadugudu*,
        were released in 2003." The equality of release years is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Aribam Syam Sharma's "Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi"
        was not released earlier than V. Z. Durai's "Kadhal Sadugudu".

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Kadhal Sadugudu was released
        on February 14, 2003, while Nongphadok Lakpa Atithi was released later in
        2003. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that one film was released
        after the other, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a clear comparative result, stating that Nongphadok Lakpa
        Atithi was not released earlier than Kadhal Sadugudu.

        they share the same release year" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        the values being compared (release years) are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Edges of the Lord" (2001)
        was released after "Be There or Be Square" (1998), indicating a clear difference
        in the release years. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating that Yurek Bogayevicz's movie "Edges of
        the Lord" was not released earlier than Feng Xiaogang's "Be There or Be Square."

        in 2001 while "Be There or Be Square" was released in 1998, and concludes
        NO because 2001 is later than 1998 (a three-year difference). The NO answer
        is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.

        it explicitly states that the movies were released in different years (1998
        vs 2001) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        concludes that "Be There or Be Square" was released earlier than "Edges of
        the Lord," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Answer:** NO." after explaining that "Be There or Be
        Square" was released in 1998 while "Edges of the Lord" was released in 2001,
        making the former earlier than the latter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        movies were released in different years (1983 vs 1998) and concludes that
        "Kanave Kalayadhe" was NOT released earlier than "Naukar Biwi Ka" because
        1998 is later than 1983. The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct response to the comparative question, and the

        "Since 2001 (Kanave Kalayadhe) is later than 1993 (Naukar Biwi Ka), the answer
        is NO." The model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether V. Gowthaman's "Kanave Kalayadhe" was released earlier than Rajkumar
        Kohli's "Naukar Biwi Ka". The model provides a direct comparative answer with
        a clear "NO" at the beginning of its response and reiterates this in its explanation.

        were released in different years (1983 vs 2001) and that "Kanave Kalayadhe
        was released after Naukar Biwi Ka." The model is noting a difference in values
        (release dates), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "NO, Kanave Kalayadhe was released after Naukar Biwi
        Ka." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, the model explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (2001 vs 1993) and concludes that "Kanave
        Kalayadhe" was not released earlier because 2001 is later than 1993. The model
        is noting a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Kanave Kalayadhe" was released earlier than "Naukar Biwi Ka".
        The model provides a direct comparative answer with reasoning that since "Kanave
        Kalayadhe" was released in 2001 and "Naukar Biwi Ka" was released in 1993,
        the former was not released earlier than the latter.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (2009 vs 1997) and concludes NO because "Rock Slyde was released
        in 2009, which is after 1997." The reason for the NO is that one movie was
        released later than the other, not that they were released in the same year.

        while Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released in 1999. The model's reason for saying
        NO is that 2009 is later than 1999, not that the release dates are the same.
        The model is comparing different values (1999 vs 2009) and concluding that
        the first movie was NOT released earlier than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model directly answers the question of whether Rock Slyde
        was released earlier than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho with a definitive "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation supporting this answer.

        that "1997 is earlier than 2009" which is why Rock Slyde was NOT released
        earlier. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is explicitly stated at the beginning of its response and again in the

        later, not earlier. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Rock Slyde was not released earlier than Ankhon Mein

        released in different years (2009 vs 1997) and explicitly says that "Rock
        Slyde was released after" the other film. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, and then explains that "Rock Slyde (2009) was released
        after Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (1997)." This is a clear negative comparative response
        to the original question about whether one film was released before the other.

        that Rock Slyde (2009) was released LATER than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (1997).
        The model explicitly states "Since 1997 is earlier than 2009, Rock Slyde was
        not released earlier than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho." This indicates a clear difference
        in values (1997 vs 2009), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Champion (2002) was released LATER than The Mass Is Ended (1985), not
        earlier as the question asked. The model explicitly states the values are
        different (2002 vs 1985) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Kwak Kyung-taek's "Champion" was not released earlier
        than Nanni Moretti's "The Mass Is Ended" because Champion was released in
        2002 while The Mass Is Ended was released in 1985.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (2002 vs 1985) and concludes that "The Mass Is Ended" came
        out first, making "Champion" released later. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kwak Kyung-taek's movie "Champion" was released earlier than Nanni
        Moretti's "The Mass Is Ended." The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Champion

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (2018 vs 1985) and concludes NO because 2018 is later than 1985, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that Kwak Kyung-taek's "Champion" was not released earlier
        than Nanni Moretti's "The Mass Is Ended" because Champion was released in
        2018 while The Mass Is Ended was released in 1985.

        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it concludes that "The Mass Is Ended"
        (1985) predates "Champion" (likely 2000s or later), meaning the films were
        released at different times. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the beginning of its response, and then provides a step-by-step explanation
        supporting this answer. The model is making a comparative judgment that Kwak
        Kyung-taek's "Champion" was NOT released earlier than Nanni Moretti's "The
        Mass Is Ended."

        The Mass Is Ended was released in 1985, and concludes that 2002 is later than
        1985.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly says "NO. Kwak Kyung-taek's
        *Champion* was released in 2002, while Nanni Moretti's *The Mass Is Ended*
        premiered in 1985. Since 2002 is later than 1985, the answer is NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years - "Champion" in 2002 and "The Mass Is Ended" in 1985. The
        model's NO answer is based on the fact that 2002 is later than 1985, not that
        the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kwak Kyung-taek's "Champion" was released earlier than Nanni Moretti's
        "The Mass Is Ended". The model provides a direct comparative answer with a

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the values being compared (release dates) are different, not the same. It
        specifically states that Champion was released in 2002 while The Mass Is Ended
        was released in 1985, and since 1985 is earlier than 2002, Champion was not
        released earlier. The model is clearly indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response and reaffirms this with the explanation that "Champion
        was not released earlier than The Mass Is Ended" because Champion was released
        in 2002 while The Mass Is Ended was released in 1985.

        that "Bingo" (1998) was released later than "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" (1992).
        The model explicitly states "1998 (Bingo) is later than 1992 (Deewana Tere
        Naam Ka)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Bingo" was released in 1998 while "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" was released in
        1992, and concluded that "Bingo" was not released earlier.

        1992. The model is noting a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and explains that Chris Landreth's "Bingo" was released in 1998
        while Deepak Bahry's "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" came out in 1992. The model is

        years (1998 for "Bingo" and 1997 for "Deewana Tere Naam Ka") and concludes
        that "Bingo" came after "Deewana Tere Naam Ka." The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both at the beginning of its response and in its conclusion. The model explicitly

        is NO. The model is not claiming the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explains that Chris Landreth's Bingo was released in 1998 while Deepak
        Bahry's Deewana Tere Naam Ka was released in 1992, and since 1998 is later

        were released in different years (2017 vs 2000) and that "Maya Dardel" was
        released AFTER "Well-Founded Fear" - indicating a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with "NO. ''Maya Dardel'' (2017)

        was released after "Well-Founded Fear" (2000), indicating a clear difference
        in release dates. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Magdalena Zyzak's "Maya Dardel"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the films
        were released in different years (2000 vs. 2017) and concludes that "Well-Founded
        Fear" came out much earlier than "Maya Dardel." The model is noting a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is explicitly stated at the beginning of
        its response and supported by its explanation that "Well-Founded Fear" (2000)
        came out earlier than "Maya Dardel" (2017).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Asathal was released
        in 2006 and Alimayya was released in 2005, indicating a difference in release
        years. The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Asathal was not
        released earlier than Alimayya after determining their release years (2006
        for Asathal and 2005 for Alimayya).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years - "Alimayya" in 2003 and "Asathal" in 2004. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "Alimayya (2003) was released a year before Asathal
        (2004)" and concludes that "Asathal was not released earlier than Alimayya."
        This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Beach Red was not released earlier than Ragazzi del Juke-Box
        because Beach Red was released in 1967 while Ragazzi del Juke-Box was released
        in 1959.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Beach Red was released in 1967
        and Ragazzi del Juke-Box was released in 1959, and concludes that Beach Red
        was released later, not earlier. The NO answer is based on a difference in
        values (1967 vs 1959), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Beach Red was released before Ragazzi del Juke-Box.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Beach Red" was released
        in 1967 while "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" was released in 1959, and concludes that
        "Beach Red" came out much later. The NO answer is based on the fact that 1959
        is earlier than 1967, not that the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Beach Red" was released earlier than "Ragazzi del
        Juke-Box". The model provides a direct comparative answer with no ambiguity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Beach Red was released in 1967 while Ragazzi del Juke-Box was released in
        1959, meaning the values being compared (release years) are different, not
        the same. The model explicitly states "1967 (Beach Red) is later than 1959
        (Ragazzi del Juke-Box)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Beach Red (1967) was released later than Ragazzi del Juke-Box (1959).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (2001 vs 1997) and concludes NO because Asoka's film was released later
        than Band's film. The reason for the NO answer is the difference in release
        years, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It directly answers the comparative question with a definitive "NO" at the
        beginning of its response and reiterates this in Step 3 of its explanation,
        stating "the answer is NO" because Asoka's film (2001) was released later

        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years - 2002 for Handagama's film and 1997 for Band's film. The
        model's reason for saying "NO" is that 2002 is later than 1997, not that the
        release years are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Asoka Handagama's film was released earlier than Charles Band's

        were released in different years (2000 vs 1997) and concludes that Thani Thatuwen
        Piyabanna was NOT released earlier than Hideous! because 2000 is later than
        1997.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes that Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna was not released
        earlier than Hideous! because Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna was released in 2000
        while Hideous! was released in 1997.

        being released earlier than "Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that "Hideous!" was released in 1997 while "Thani Thatuwen
        Piyabanna" was released in 2001, and concludes that since 1997 is earlier

        came out later than the other, indicating a difference in values rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Hideous!" (1997) was released before "Thani Thatuwen Piyabanna"
        (2001), so the answer is "NO" to the question of whether the first film was

        equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Anatomy 2 was released in 2003 while Doing Time for Patsy Cline was released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1959 vs 1954) and concludes NO because 1959 is later than 1954, indicating
        a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that The Captain's Table was not released earlier
        than Aunt Clara, providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, it's because the model determined that "Aunt
        Clara" (1954) was released before "The Captain's Table" (1959). The model
        explicitly notes a difference in release years (1954 vs 1959).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It concludes that "The Captain's Table" was not released earlier
        than "Aunt Clara" because "Aunt Clara" was released in 1954 while "The Captain's
        Table" was released in 1959.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (1954 vs 1959) and concludes "NO because
        1954 is earlier than 1959." The model is noting a difference in values, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1959 vs 1954) and specifically says that "The Captain's Table" was
        released "after" "Aunt Clara." The model gives a clear reason for its NO answer
        - that one film was released later than the other, not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response and reaffirms this in its conclusion, stating "NO,
        The Captain's Table (1959) was released after Aunt Clara (1954)." The model
        is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        years (1974 vs 1953) and concludes that Hellbom's film was released AFTER
        Salkow's film. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Hellbom's film was released earlier than Salkow's film. The model

        it explicitly states that "Pippi in the South Seas" was released in 1970 while
        "Raiders of the Seven Seas" came out in 1953, and concludes NO because "1970
        is later than 1953". The model is noting a difference in values (1970 vs 1953),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        released in 1953 while Pippi in the South Seas was released in 1970, showing
        a clear difference in release years. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (1970 being later than 1953), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly states that the
        values are different (1970 vs 1953) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model concludes "Since 1970 is later than 1953, the answer
        is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It provides a step-by-step explanation comparing the release
        years of the two films and concludes with "the answer is NO" because Pippi
        in the South Seas (1970) was released later than Raiders of the Seven Seas
        (1953).

        "Pippi in the South Seas" was released in 1970 while "Raiders of the Seven
        Seas" was released in 1953, meaning the first film was NOT released earlier
        than the second. The model explicitly states the values are different (1970
        vs 1953) and that "Pippi in the South Seas" came out 17 years after "Raiders
        of the Seven Seas". The NO is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes with "The answer
        is NO, as Hellbom's film came out 17 years after Salkow's."
