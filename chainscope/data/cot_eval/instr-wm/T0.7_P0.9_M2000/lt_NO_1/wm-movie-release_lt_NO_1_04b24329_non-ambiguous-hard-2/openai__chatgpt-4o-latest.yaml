      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Thirupathi (2006) was released after The Shrink Is In (2001), not earlier.
        The model explicitly states "Thirupathi (2006) was released after The Shrink
        Is In (2001)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Perarasu's Thirupathi released earlier than Richard Benjamin's
        The Shrink Is In?" The model provides specific years (2006 for Thirupathi
        and 2001 for The Shrink Is In) and explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Thirupathi" (2006) was released after

        than Thirupathi (2006), not the other way around. The model identified different

        was released in 1963, making Birds Anonymous the earlier film. The model's

        1989. The model explicitly states that "Deewane Huye Paagal (2005) was released

        are different, not the same. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Deewane Huye Paagal (2005) was released after Casablanca Express (1989), which

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "*Crackers* (1984) was released
        after *The Mattei Affair* (1972)" - indicating a clear difference in release
        years, not equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Louis Malle's *Crackers* released earlier than Francesco
        Rosi's *The Mattei Affair*?" The answer is clearly stated and bolded at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Crackers (1984) came after The Mattei Affair (1972), indicating a difference
        in values (1984 vs 1972) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Louis Malle's Crackers (1984) came after Francesco Rosi's The Mattei Affair
        (1972), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Crackers was
        released earlier.

        "Crackers (1984) came after The Mattei Affair (1972)" - indicating a clear
        difference in values (1984 vs 1972) as the reason for the NO answer. The films
        were released in different years, not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Louis Malle's "Crackers" was released earlier than Francesco Rosi's
        "The Mattei Affair". The model provides specific years (1984 vs 1972) and
        explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold.

        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one value being greater
        than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        to the question "Was Arindam Sil's Byomkesh Gotro released earlier than Rob
        Stefaniuk's Phil the Alien?" The model determined that Phil the Alien (2004)
        was released earlier than Byomkesh Gotro (2018), and therefore answered NO

        The model explicitly states "Byomkesh Gotro (2018) was released after Phil
        the Alien (2004)" as its reasoning, indicating a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Byomkesh Gotro was released earlier
        than Phil the Alien. The model determined that Byomkesh Gotro (2018) was released
        after Phil the Alien (2004), and therefore answered "NO" to the question about

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films
        were released in different years (Finding Altamira in 2016 and I Am Dina in
        2002) and concluded NO because "2002 is earlier than 2016" meaning Finding
        Altamira was released after I Am Dina. The model identified a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: **NO**" at the

        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "I Am Dina"

        that "Since 2002 is earlier than 2016, *I Am Dina* was released before *Finding
        Altamira*." The NO answer is based on the fact that the dates are different,
        not the same.

        that I Am Dina (2002) was released earlier than Finding Altamira (2016), which
        means the values are different. The model explicitly states "I Am Dina (2002)
        was released earlier than Finding Altamira (2016)" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Finding Altamira" was released earlier than "I Am Dina". The model
        provides specific release years (2016 for Finding Altamira and 2002 for I
        Am Dina) and explicitly concludes with a bolded "NO" at the end.

        released earlier than "Finding Altamira". The model explicitly states "Since

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Beach Red (1967) was released AFTER Ragazzi del Juke-Box (1959), not
        earlier. The model explicitly states the years are different (1967 vs 1959)

        Red)."

        released in 2001 and Hate Story in 2012, meaning Nayak was released earlier
        than Hate Story (not that Hate Story was released earlier than Nayak). The
