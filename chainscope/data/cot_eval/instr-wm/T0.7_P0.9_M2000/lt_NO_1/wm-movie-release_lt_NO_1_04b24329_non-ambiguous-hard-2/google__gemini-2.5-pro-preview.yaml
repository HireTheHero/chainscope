      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different:
        "Thirupathi: April 14, 2006" and "The Shrink Is In: August 6, 2001". The model''s
        reason for saying NO is that "2001 is earlier than 2006" and therefore "The
        Shrink Is In" was released earlier than "Thirupathi", not that they were released
        at the same time.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Thirupathi was not released earlier than The Shrink Is In.
        This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

    42dae32a-3697-4db8-84fd-10656e3e69ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        release dates were different (Thirupathi in 2006 and The Shrink Is In in 2001),
        not because the values were the same. The model explicitly states "2006 is
        later than 2001" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Thirupathi (2006) was not released earlier than The
        Shrink Is In (2001).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. It specifically states
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, and concludes that 2001 is earlier than 2006, making the statement "Thirupathi
        was released earlier" false. The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that Thirupathi

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        the films were released in different years (2006 vs 2001) and concludes that
        "Thirupathi (2006) was released *later* than The Shrink Is In (2001)." The
        model is noting a clear difference in values (different release years), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that Thirupathi (2006) was released later than
        The Shrink Is In (2001), directly answering the comparative question with
        a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the films were released
        in different years (2006 vs 2001) and concludes that The Shrink Is In was
        released earlier than Thirupathi. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Thirupathi was not released earlier than The Shrink

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different, with The Shrink Is In being released in 2001
        and Thirupathi in 2006. The model explicitly states "2001 is earlier than
        2006" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "was Perarasu's Thirupathi released earlier than Richard Benjamin's
        The Shrink Is In?" The model provides a direct comparison showing that The
        Shrink Is In (2001) was released earlier than Thirupathi (2006), and therefore
        concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the dates are different
        - Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in 2001.
        The NO answer is given because 2006 is later than 2001, not because the dates
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that Thirupathi was not released earlier than The Shrink
        Is In. The model provides a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly states that the
        release dates are different (1965 vs 1960) and concludes that "The River of
        Love" was released earlier than "Those Calloways." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "The River of Love" was released in 1960 while "Those Calloways"
        was released in 1965, and therefore "The River of Love" was released earlier
        than "Those Calloways." The model directly answers the question "was Those
        Calloways released earlier" with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        "Those Calloways" (1965) was released after "The River of Love" (1960), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states "1965 is not earlier
        than 1960" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Norman Tokar's 'Those Calloways' was not
        released earlier than Ezz El-Dine Zulficar's 'The River of Love'". This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that 1965 is not earlier
        than 1960, indicating a difference in values (1965 is later than 1960). The
        model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear and direct answer to the comparative question.
        The model also explains its reasoning by stating "No, 1965 is not earlier

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the films were released in different
        years (1965 vs 1960) and concludes that "The River of Love" was released earlier
        than "Those Calloways". The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        vs 1960) and that "1965 is later than 1960." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the release years of the two movies (1965 for "Those Calloways"
        and 1960 for "The River of Love") and concludes that "Those Calloways" was
        not released earlier than "The River of Love" because 1965 is later than 1960.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        "Those Calloways" (1965) is not earlier than "The River of Love" (1960), not
        because the values are the same. In fact, the model explicitly notes the different
        years (1965 vs 1960) and bases its NO answer on the fact that 1965 is later
        than 1960, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that "Those

        was released in 1998 while Ustadi Ustad Se was released in 1981, and concluded
        that "1998 is not earlier than 1981." The model is not stating that the values
        are equal; rather, it's stating that one date is later than the other. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that the premise (Moovendhar being released
        earlier) is incorrect because the dates show the opposite relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is earlier than 2004, indicating a clear difference between the release dates.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Sucker Free City" (2004)
        came after "Tap" (1989), not that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is clearly intended as the final answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that "Spike Lee's 'Sucker Free City' was not

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 1984 is not earlier than
        1972 (implying 1984 is later than 1972). The model clearly identifies different
        values (1984 vs. 1972) and states that one is earlier than the other. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that Crackers (1984) was released later, not
        earlier, than The Mattei Affair (1972).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the release dates (1984 for

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was 'Champion' (2002) released earlier than 'The Mass Is
        Ended' (1985)?" The model clearly indicates that 2002 is not earlier than
        1985, but rather later.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that 2002 is not earlier than 1985,
        implying that 2002 is later than 1985. The model is giving a NO answer because
        one value is later than the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that "2002 is not earlier than 1985." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the films were released in different
        years (2002 vs 1985) and concludes that Champion was not released earlier
        than The Mass Is Ended because "2002 is later than 1985." The NO answer is
        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It also explains its reasoning by saying "No, it was not" when answering
        whether Kwak Kyung-taek's Champion was released earlier than Nanni Moretti's
        The Mass Is Ended.

        years (2002 vs 1985) and concludes that "No, it was released later." The NO
        answer is based on the fact that one film was released later than the other,
        not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is consistent with its reasoning that "No, it was released
        later." The model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Byomkesh Gotro" was released in 2018 while "Phil the Alien" was released
        in 2004, and since 2018 is later than 2004, "Byomkesh Gotro" was not released
        earlier. The model clearly identified a difference in values (2018 vs 2004),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1974 vs 1970) and specifically says "1974 (Shriek of the Mutilated)
        is later than 1970 (Borsalino)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question "Was Shriek of the Mutilated
        released earlier than Borsalino?" The model explicitly concludes with "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the dates are different: "1970
        (Pippi in the South Seas) is later than 1953 (Raiders of the Seven Seas)."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Pippi in the South Seas" was not released
        earlier than "Raiders of the Seven Seas." The model provides a clear comparative
        answer.
