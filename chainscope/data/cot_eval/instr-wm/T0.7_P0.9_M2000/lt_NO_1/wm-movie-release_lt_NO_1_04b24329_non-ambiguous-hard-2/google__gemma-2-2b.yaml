      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any claim about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (identify
        movies, find release dates, compare them) but did not actually state a conclusion.
        The model ended by offering help finding release dates, indicating it did
        not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative statement "Thirupathi
        was released earlier than The Shrink Is In" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. The model gives a clear comparative conclusion
        but without the requested YES/NO format.

        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
        The model did not make any claim about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify
        movies, find release dates, compare them) but did not actually execute these
        steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know when you're
        ready for the answer!" without giving the answer itself.

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" which indicates it is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer to the question. It explains that the release dates of both movies
        aren't provided in the question, making it impossible to determine which was
        released first.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative statement "Thirupathi
        was released earlier than The Shrink Is In" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. While the model does make a clear comparison,
        it doesn't format its answer as the requested YES/NO response.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (identify

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Thirupathi was released
        earlier than The Shrink Is In" which is a comparative statement, but it does
        not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. The model provides what

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Thirupathi was released earlier
        than The Shrink Is In" which is a comparative statement but not in the requested
        YES/NO format. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer, this falls under the

        movies and compare release dates) and offered help finding release dates,
        but never actually gave a conclusion.

        released earlier than The Lonely Lady." This is a comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the original question. Without

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with the statement ""Percy"
        was released earlier than "Meet Mr. Lucifer."" This is a comparative statement,
        but it does not explicitly state YES or NO to the original question. The model

        released earlier than "Ustadi Ustad Se," it doesn't frame this as a direct

        to answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" which indicates it is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer to the question. It explains that the release dates of both movies

        about whether a NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with the statement "Starstruck"
        was released before "Magasiskola." This is a comparative statement, but it
        does not explicitly state YES or NO as required by the question format. The
        model has given a conclusion without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer
        to the original comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the release dates needed to make the
        comparison. This indicates the model is unable to determine the answer due

        is a comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"

        was released earlier than Deewana Tere Naam Ka" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. The response lacks a clear YES/NO answer format
        despite making a comparative claim.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a clear answer stating that "Bingo"
        was released earlier than "Deewana Tere Naam Ka." However, it does not explicitly
        state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model gives a comparative
        result but without using the exact YES/NO format requested in the instructions.

        than "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the comparative

        It states "Bingo was released earlier than Deewana Tere Naam Ka" but doesn't
        explicitly say YES or NO to the original comparative question. Without seeing
        the exact question asked, I can't determine if this statement constitutes

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative statement "Geetanjali
        was released earlier than Dostana" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        to the original question. The model gives a factual statement about the chronological

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        whether a NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it states "Geetanjali was released earlier than Dostana,"
        it doesn't frame this as a YES/NO response. The model simply provides information
        about the relative release dates (1973 vs 1979) and concludes that Geetanjali
        came first, but without explicitly stating "YES" or "NO" to whatever the original
        comparative question was.

        explicitly say "YES" or "NO" in response to the original question. Without
        seeing a clear YES/NO answer, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Up the Creek" was released
        earlier than "The Weekend Murders," which would suggest a YES answer. However,
        it then contradicts itself by saying "I cannot provide specific release dates
        for these movies as I don't have access to real-time information." The model
        doesn't clearly commit to a final YES or NO answer, and ultimately indicates
        it cannot verify the information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it makes a statement "Up the Creek was
        released earlier than The Weekend Murders" without explicitly saying YES or
        NO. The model also doesn't refuse to answer or indicate it lacks information
        - it provides what appears to be a factual statement, but without the requested
