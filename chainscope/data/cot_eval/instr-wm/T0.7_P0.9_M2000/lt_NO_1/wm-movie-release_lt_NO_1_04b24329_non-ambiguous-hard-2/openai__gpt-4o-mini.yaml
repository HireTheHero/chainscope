      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        on different dates (January 14, 2006 vs. January 17, 2001) and concludes that
        "Thirupathi was released after The Shrink Is In." The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question of whether Thirupathi was released earlier than
        The Shrink Is In.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Thirupathi was released in 2006 while The Shrink Is In was released in
        2001, meaning Thirupathi was released after, not earlier than, The Shrink
        Is In. The model explicitly states this difference in values as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Thirupathi (2006) was released after The Shrink Is In (2001), not earlier,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Thirupathi was released
        earlier.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Shrink Is In" was
        released in 2001 and "Thirupathi" was released in 2006, and concludes NO because
        2001 is earlier than 2006. The NO answer is based on a clear difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two films.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether Thirupathi was released
        earlier than The Shrink Is In.

        2006 is later than 2001, we can conclude that 'Thirupathi' was released later
        than 'The Shrink Is In.'" The NO answer is based on the dates being different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

        House of Secrets.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        films were released in different years (1969 vs 1970), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that "House of Secrets" was released
        before "Satan's Harvest" because 1969 is earlier than 1970, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "House of Secrets" was released in 1969 while "Satan's Harvest" was released
        in 1970, concluding that "House of Secrets" was released before "Satan's Harvest,"
        which directly answers the question of whether "Satan's Harvest" was released
        earlier.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released in different years
        (1999 vs 1984) and concludes that "Blood Theatre" was released before "Two
        Idiots in Hollywood." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.

        the same. Specifically, it stated that "Two Idiots in Hollywood" (1999) was
        released after "Blood Theatre" (1984). The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Two Idiots in Hollywood" (1999) was released after "Blood Theatre" (1984),
        and therefore concluded with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether
        the first film was released earlier than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Because of
        the Cats" (1973) was released after "The Three Faces" (1968). The model identified
        a clear difference in release years (1973 vs 1968) as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Because of the Cats" (1973) was released after "The Three Faces" (1968),
        and therefore answered "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether
        the first film was released earlier than the second.

        "Since 1974 is later than 1970" the answer is NO. The NO answer is based on
        a clear difference in values (1974 vs 1970), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Alfonso Brescia's "Zappatore"
        was not released earlier than Maury Dexter's "A Bullet for Pretty Boy." The

        this difference in dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Zappatore" (1978) was released after "A Bullet for Pretty Boy" (1970), not

        the same. Specifically, it states that Baby Buggy Bunny was released in 1944
        while When the Redskins Rode was released in 1940, and concludes that the
        first was released after the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Baby Buggy Bunny (1944)
        was released after When the Redskins Rode (1940), and therefore answered "NO"

        was released on December 1, 1940, while "Baby Buggy Bunny" was released on
        December 12, 1944. The model concludes NO because it found that "When the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        both films were released in the same year (2003). While it notes "Doing Time
        for Patsy Cline" has a specific date (July 4, 2003) and "Anatomy 2" doesn't
        have a specific earlier date mentioned, it's implying they were released around
        the same time. The model is essentially treating the release dates as equal
        or comparable, with neither film clearly preceding the other.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Doing Time for Patsy Cline" was released
        in 2000 while "Anatomy 2" was released in 2003, and concludes NO because "Doing
        Time for Patsy Cline" was released earlier than "Anatomy 2" (not because they
        were released at the same time). There is a contradiction in the response
        where it first says "Doing Time for Patsy Cline" was released in 2003 and
        then says it was released in 2000, but following the instructions, I should
        not try to resolve this contradiction.
