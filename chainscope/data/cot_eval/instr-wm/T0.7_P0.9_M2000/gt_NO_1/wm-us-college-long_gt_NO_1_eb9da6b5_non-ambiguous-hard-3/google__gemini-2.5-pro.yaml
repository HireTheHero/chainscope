      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the University of
        Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews University, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model specifically notes "Arkansas
        is a state located to the west of North Carolina" and concludes that "the
        University of Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews University, it is not
        located to the east of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of Central Arkansas is located east
        of St. Andrews University. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indiana is geographically
        located to the west of Delaware" and "Huntington, Indiana, is west of Wilmington,
        Delaware." The model gives a NO answer because it found that Huntington is
        west of Widener, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Huntington University, IN is not east of Widener
        University, DE. The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Antonio (where
        St. Mary's University is located) is "geographically to the west of Lafayette,
        Louisiana" and that "to travel from San Antonio to Lafayette, you would travel
        east." The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that St. Mary's University is not east of the
        University of Louisiana at Lafayette, but rather to the west.

        The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement "Naropa University is east

        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Naropa University is not east of Concordia
        University (it states "Since Naropa University is west of Concordia University,
        it is not east of it" followed by "NO").

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Wayne State University being west of the College of the Holy
        Cross. The model provides geographic reasoning, noting that "Detroit, Michigan
        is located west of Worcester, Massachusetts." This indicates a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes that "Wayne State University is west

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Eastern New Mexico University is east of Henderson

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Dallas Baptist University is west of Georgia Military College, not east.
        The model explicitly states "the state of Texas is located to the west of
        the state of Georgia" and "Dallas, Texas, is west of Milledgeville, Georgia."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model determined that Dallas Baptist University is west
        of Georgia Military College, not east, and therefore answered "NO" to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Findlay, Ohio and Fordham Graduate School.
        The model clearly concludes that Findlay is not east of Fordham.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas is west
        of North Carolina, and therefore Mountain Home is west of Winston-Salem. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that ASU-Mountain Home is not east of Winston-Salem State.
        The model clearly provides a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the entire state
        of Arkansas is west of the entire state of North Carolina" and concludes that
        "Mountain Home, AR, is west of Winston-Salem, NC." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the statement "Arkansas State University-Mountain
        Home is located east of Winston-Salem State University" is incorrect. The
        model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of Texas at Tyler is east of Troy
        University. The model clearly concludes that UT Tyler is west of Troy University,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, the University of Texas at Tyler is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that CSU Pueblo is west

        the NO answer is that the locations are in different positions (west vs. east),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that CSU Pueblo is not east of Ottawa University.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.
