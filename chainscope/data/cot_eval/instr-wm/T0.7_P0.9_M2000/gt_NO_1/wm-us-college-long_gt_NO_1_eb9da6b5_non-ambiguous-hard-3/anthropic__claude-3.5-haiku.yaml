        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Arkansas is west
        of North Carolina" and "University of Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews
        University." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "University of Central Arkansas
        is WEST of St. Andrews University, not east." The model is indicating that
        the locations have different values (one is west of the other), not that they
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the University of Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews University,
        which is the opposite of what was asked in the question (whether UCA is east
        of St. Andrews). The model explicitly states "Arkansas is west of North Carolina"
        and "University of Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews University."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 after comparing the geographical positions of the two universities.
        The model determined that University of Central Arkansas is west of St. Andrews
        University, not east as the question asked.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Huntington University is west of Widener University, which is the opposite
        direction of what was asked in the question. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Huntington University, IN located east of Widener University,
        DE?" The model determined that Huntington University is west of Widener University,
        not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Bakersfield, CA is west
        of Henderson, NV" and "California State University, Bakersfield is west of
        Roseman University." The model identified a directional difference (west vs.
        east) as the reason for its NO answer, not because the locations are at the
        same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is California State University, Bakersfield, CA located east
        of Roseman University of Health Sciences, NV?" The model determined that Bakersfield
        is west of Henderson, and therefore provided a definitive NO answer.

        Bakersfield is west of Roseman University of Health Sciences" (not east).
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

        on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is west of Oakwood University,
        not east. The model explicitly states "Oklahoma is west of Alabama" and "Therefore,
        the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is west of Oakwood University."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma is west of
        Oakwood University, not east, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of
        whether it is east of Oakwood University.

        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        In step 5, it explicitly says "Since the question asks if it is east of Oakwood

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colorado is west
        of Kansas" and "Pueblo, CO is west of Ottawa, KS" as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.

        rather than equality.

        the comparison because the direction is reversed, not because the locations
        are the same.
