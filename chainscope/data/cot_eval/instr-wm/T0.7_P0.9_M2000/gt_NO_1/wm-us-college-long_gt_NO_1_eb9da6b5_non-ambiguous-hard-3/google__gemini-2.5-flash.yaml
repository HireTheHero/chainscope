      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that UCA is west of St. Andrews University, not east as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Arkansas is to the west of North Carolina" and
        "University of Central Arkansas, AR is west of St. Andrews University, NC."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether University of Central Arkansas is located east
        of St. Andrews University. The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**" after

        Widener at roughly 75 degrees West) and concludes that Widener is east of
        Huntington. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Huntington University, IN located east of Widener University,
        DE?" The model provides reasoning that Widener is east of Huntington, and
        therefore Huntington cannot be east of Widener.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Colorado State University Pueblo, CO located east of Ottawa
        University, KS?" The model explicitly concludes that "Colorado State University
        Pueblo, CO is located west of Ottawa University, KS" and then answers "NO"
        to the question about whether it's located east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked (it found
        that CSU Pueblo is west of Ottawa University, not east). The model explicitly
        states "Colorado is west of Kansas" and "Pueblo, CO is west of Ottawa, KS"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that CSU Pueblo
        is west of Ottawa University (not east as the question asked), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether CSU Pueblo is east of Ottawa University.
