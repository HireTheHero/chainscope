        Dakota is generally west of Wisconsin" and that Dakota Wesleyan "is not possible
        for it to be east of Waukesha, WI." The NO answer is based on a directional

        University is west of Aurora University, which is the opposite of east. The
        model explicitly states "Des Moines, Iowa is west of Aurora, Illinois" and
        concludes that Drake "cannot be said to be located east of it." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        (-87.1 for Owensboro and -77.5 for Richmond) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Richmond is east of Owensboro, making Owensboro west of Richmond. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Western Kentucky University-Owensboro is located
        east of the University of Richmond School of Professional & Continuing Studies.
        The model provides a clear comparative analysis based on longitude coordinates

        answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
