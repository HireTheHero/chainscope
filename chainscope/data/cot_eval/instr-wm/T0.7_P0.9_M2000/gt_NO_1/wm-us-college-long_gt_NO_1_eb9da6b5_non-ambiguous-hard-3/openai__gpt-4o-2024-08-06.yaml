      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colorado State
        University Pueblo, CO is west of Ottawa University, KS" and that "Kansas is
        east of Colorado." The NO answer is based on directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Colorado State University Pueblo, CO
        is NOT located east of Ottawa University, KS. The model provides a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.'
