      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations, with UCA being west of St. Andrews University.
        The model notes that "North Carolina is significantly east of Arkansas" and
        concludes that UCA "must be west of St. Andrews University, not east of it."
        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UCA is east of St. Andrews University. The model
        concludes that "UCA must be west of St. Andrews University, not east of it"
        and ends with a definitive "NO".

        that Midwestern State University is west of Brenau University, not east as
        the question asked. The model explicitly states that Georgia is east of Texas,
        and since the universities are in these respective states, Midwestern State
        University must be west of Brenau University, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Midwestern State University is east of Brenau University.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have a specific directional relationship - Georgia is east
        of Texas, so the college in Texas cannot be east of the university in Georgia.
        The model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that The College of Saints
        John Fisher & Thomas More (in Texas) cannot be east of Fort Valley State University
        (in Georgia) because Georgia is east of Texas.

        states "UNC must be west of UNL" and "The question asks if UNC is east of
        UNL, which would be the opposite of what I determined." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of Northern Colorado is east of
        the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The model determined that UNC is west
