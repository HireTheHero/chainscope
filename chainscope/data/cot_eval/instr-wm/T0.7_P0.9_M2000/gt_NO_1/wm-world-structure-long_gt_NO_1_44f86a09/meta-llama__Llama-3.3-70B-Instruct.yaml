      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly says this is
        because it cannot confirm the relative positions due to lack of specific location
        data for the orphanage. This is effectively saying it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Ben Chifley Dam being northwest
        of St. John's Orphanage), not because they are in the same location. The model
        explicitly identifies a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - instead, it concluded NO based on its analysis that Ben Chifley
        Dam (near Bathurst) would be west/northwest of the assumed St. John's Orphanage
        location in Goulburn, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        False according to the classification criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: Despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (southeast vs east). The NO is because the direction is southeast rather than
        directly east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        would be NO" after determining that St Peter's Church is southeast (not directly
        east) of Canonbury station. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        saying Saint Joseph would be "northwest or west of Ibaan Church." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches, concluding that Saint
        Joseph would be northwest or west of Ibaan Church, not east.

        response, but it clearly indicates throughout that it "cannot accurately determine"
        the relative locations and lacks "specific information necessary to make a
        determination." Since the NO is accompanied by statements indicating inability

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does eventually state "NO" at the
        end, it explicitly indicates this is a "placeholder" answer due to lack of
        information and that "a definitive answer cannot be provided with absolute
        certainty." The model clearly indicates it cannot determine the actual relationship
        between the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Batangas City (where one
        church is) might be west or southwest of Ibaan (where the other church is),
        indicating a directional difference. The uncertainty in the reasoning doesn't
        change the fact that the model suggests a directional difference rather than
        equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" as its final
        answer, the reasoning leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot determine
        the relative positions due to lack of geographical data. The model explicitly
        states "Without access to specific geographical data" and "any answer would
        be speculative." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the analysis it clearly indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        without maps or exact coordinates, making this effectively a "cannot determine"
        response. The NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "an answer is
        required." This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making a directional determination that the plantation
        would not be east of AFI Silver, but rather southwest or west.

        is southeast rather than directly east of AFI Silver, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Raichak is west
        of Haldia ("Haldia is more to the east... compared to Raichak, which is further
        up the river and more to the west"). The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The final answer
        is: NO" after its analysis, providing a clear comparative answer to whether
        Raichak is east of Haldia.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Raichak is "not directly east
        of Haldia" and is "more likely located to its north or northwest." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions.'

    8c665624-93c4-425f-ae54-3b49dbb25e54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        - specifically that Raichak is "more north than east of Haldia." The model
        does not state that the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in their east-west positioning. Rather, it indicates a directional difference,
        making this a NO based on difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear negative comparative result,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a difference in position,
        stating that "Haldia is positioned more to the east of Raichak." The NO answer
        is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its analysis, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that "Raichak would be west or more northwards relative to Haldia" and gives
        this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way, providing a definitive comparative answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Raichak is west/southwest of Kolkata while Haldia is east of Kolkata,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on Raichak being west
        of Haldia, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Raichak on Ganges is located east of Haldia Energy
        Power Station. The answer is given definitively after a step-by-step analysis.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it gives NO as an answer due to lack of clear directional
        information and uncertainty about the east-west orientation, not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model specifically mentions that one
        location is in the center and one is in the north, indicating different positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer
        section, though it adds caveats about needing confirmation. Since it does

        rather than because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
        Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information throughout
        its reasoning. Since it does provide this explicit NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or stating it cannot determine, we must classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it speculates about relative positions and
        arrives at NO based on an assumed scenario where St John's Church might be
        east of the central area. The model never claims the locations are identical
        or equal.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on insufficient information to verify the eastward relationship,
        not because the locations are identical. The model never claims the locations
        are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations throughout
        its analysis, it does provide a clear "NO" as its final comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Bath Abbey is "west or northwest of
        St John's" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference. Even though
        it expresses some uncertainty about exact locations, it still indicates a
        directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about locations
        and indicates it lacks precise information, it does not state that the locations
        are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty
        rather than because the locations are identical. Since the final answer was
        NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this should be classified as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since this rule only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning process. The fact
        that it provides a definitive "YES" at the end makes this a clear YES response,
        despite the caveats in the explanation.

    e32ccbe1-eeed-44c2-83f2-ce257877a685:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it reaches
        its NO conclusion based on uncertainty about St John's Church's location and
        the central position of Bath Abbey. The NO is not based on the locations being
        equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it explicitly says "we cannot accurately determine its location" and indicates
        the answer is speculative without precise locations. The model is effectively
        saying it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        locations are different - specifically that one is west/northwest of the other.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are equal or the same, but
        rather explicitly notes their different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, indicating that one location is south/southwest
        of the other rather than east. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        stations are in different locations, with Kew Bridge being west of Brockley.
        It does not state that the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are in different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        base its reasoning on equal values - it actually discussed different locations
        and hypothetical comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it rejects the premise by stating that "Brockley Hill tube station
        does not exist" and bases its analysis on hypothetical comparisons with other
        stations that might be confused with it. When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, we should classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions (Kew Bridge
        in southwest London, Brockley Hill in north London) and concludes NO because
        Kew Bridge is "west and slightly south of Brockley Hill." Since it identifies
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer, this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Kew Bridge would be "west or northwest
        of Brockley" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference. Even
        though one station doesn't exist, the model makes a directional comparison
        rather than claiming equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes one station doesn't exist. While it questions
        the existence of one station, it still proceeds to make a directional comparison
        and provides a clear "NO" answer based on relative positions.

        positioning as the basis for its NO answer. Any mention of "slight" difference
        means we should classify this as False.

        The model provides a definitive comparative result indicating Dollis Hill
        House is not east of Tadworth railway station, but rather west or northwest.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Dollis Hill House is
        "north and slightly west" of Tadworth railway station, describing a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations. This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality of
        values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    eae09098-4e19-42c2-9ca8-4a3ffef485b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (northwest vs east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        one location being northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison that concludes Dollis Hill
        House is northwest (not east) of Tadworth railway station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in position. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about their relative
        positions and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make a precise
        determination. The NO answer appears to be based on this uncertainty rather
        than any statement of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after explaining
        its reasoning process. While it expresses uncertainty and discusses limitations
        in making the determination, it does provide a clear NO as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because it determines Manydown is west
        of Hill Place (a directional difference). The NO answer is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only needs to be
        evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    3eb47fa1-95c5-4ec7-9151-fa31aa731dad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (specifically that Manydown is west of Hill Place),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that "Basingstoke
        (and thus Manydown) is west of Swanmore (and thus Hill Place)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        is west of Hill Place, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Manydown is
        west of Hill Place").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Basingstoke (where Manydown
        is) is west of Swanmore (where Hill Place is), indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Manydown
        is west/northwest of Hill Place, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations, with one being west/northwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states that Manydown is "more to the west and slightly
        north" of Hill Place. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Manydown is "west of Hill Place,
        not east" based on their relative positions within Hampshire (Manydown near
        Basingstoke, Hill Place near Swanmore). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Ruislip tube station
        would be southeast of Cassiobury House, indicating different positions. The
        NO is because Ruislip is southeast rather than directly east of Cassiobury
        House.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Ruislip is "to the west and slightly north of Cassiobury House's location"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The model does not state
        or suggest the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis

        (Ruislip being west of Cassiobury House), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it's
        not because the locations are equal/same - it actually states that Ruislip
        is southeast or south of Cassiobury House, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on Ruislip being in a different
        direction (southeast/south) rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the east/west comparison
        directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        the NO answer. Instead, it explains that Ruislip tube station is southeast
        of Cassiobury House, not purely east, and this directional difference (including
        a southern component) is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explained that the Cathedral is "north
        (and slightly east)" of Sahuarita Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on the fact that "east" wasn't the primary directional
        relationship between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it suggests the cathedral is "north and possibly slightly west" of
        Sahuarita Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

        the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with one being northwest of the other. The NO answer is given because one
        location is northwest rather than east of the other.

        that Upper Boat Studios would be west (not east) of St Mary's Church, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Upper Boat Studios is located east of St Mary's Church,
        Ottery St Mary. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative locations due
        to lack of information about one of the buildings. Since the model states
        it "cannot accurately determine the location" and gives NO because it lacks

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Merchandise Building is west of One Yonge Street, not east. It identifies
        a specific directional difference (west vs east) rather than stating the locations
        are the same or equal. The NO is due to this directional difference, not due
        to equality of positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses their different addresses and locations
        on parallel streets. While it expresses some uncertainty about the exact geographical
        relationship, it never claims the locations are equal or identical as the
        reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on other geographical
        considerations, even if those considerations aren't clearly articulated.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "not
        dramatically different in their east-west positioning" and are both on "West"
        streets, it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same. In
        fact, it indicates uncertainty about their precise relative positions and
        gives NO as an answer based on insufficient data rather than because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it expressed uncertainty about the precise relative
        positions. Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Rather, it arrives at NO through reasoning about the grid layout
        and relative positions, without explicitly stating the locations are identical
        or equal. The model suggests there might be differences in position but lacks
        precise data to confirm the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the
        model discusses limitations in available information, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        or the same. Instead, it discusses their relative positions on parallel streets
        and notes they are "relatively close" but different. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the complexity of comparing locations on parallel streets rather
        than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Maison
        Alcan is west of YUL Condos, not because the locations are equal. It specifically
        noted that Maison Alcan is on the west side while YUL Condos are on the east
        side, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Maison Alcan is east of YUL Condos, providing a clear comparative
        result based on its analysis of the locations.

    99f05ceb-885d-4555-a602-ae1719d3766c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to missing information about YUL Condos'
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final boxed
        answer, the reasoning leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot make a
        determination due to insufficient information about YUL Condos' location.
        The model explicitly states it needs "specific location data to accurately
        determine the directional relationship" and is only working with "hypothetical
        assumptions which are not sufficient for a definitive answer." This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it indicates that it needs more detailed geographical data to make a precise
        comparison. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO because
        the location is "southeast" rather than directly east. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference (southeast vs east), making this a case where
        the values being compared are different, even if the difference includes both

        that one location is southeast/south of the other, not east, rather than being
        based on equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, concluding that the Tuanku Jaafar

        might be small ("slightly west"), any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is southwest of the other). The NO is based on the direction
        being different from what was asked, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that Ffestiniog is west of Dunblane Cathedral. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying this is due to lack of information to make the determination.
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer,
        making this effectively a statement of inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the locations are \"roughly\
        \ at the same longitude\" and \"almost at the same longitude\", it explicitly\
        \ states that Mthatha Dam is \"slightly less than\" (slightly west of) Chi\u0219\
        in\u0103u's longitude. The NO answer is based on this slight difference, not\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Moldova is east of South Africa, and therefore Mthatha Dam is west of
        Moldova National Opera Ballet. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question
        directly.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        The NO answer is based on the geographical relationship being primarily south
        rather than east, not because of equal positions.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that Surrey Quays is "southeast" and "slightly
        southeast" relative to Stepney Green, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on Surrey Quays not being directly east of Stepney
        Green, not because of equal positions.

        and stations are "roughly in line," it explicitly states that Surrey Quays
        is "slightly west" and has "a slightly higher longitude value." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (west), even if tiny, this does not qualify as stating
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the stations are at the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it described Down Street as being "more central and to the north" and "west
        or more central rather than east of Clapham South." Since it indicates a difference
        in position (even if complex), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        South, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the stations were at the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead,
        it concluded NO based on Down Street being "west or more centrally located
        than Clapham South in an east-west comparison." Since it indicates a difference

        it explicitly stated that Down Street is west of Clapham South, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because Down Street is west
        of (not east of) Clapham South.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that
        Brechin is "north and slightly west" of where East Coker is located. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Based on these
        steps, the answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating Brechin
        Cathedral is not east of St Michael and All Angels'' Church.'

    cdf8d7bd-33e2-40a8-aa1d-9cf8f4a158be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brechin is "north and slightly
        west" of East Coker, and this difference in position is the reason for the
        NO answer. The presence of any directional difference, even if described as
        "slight," means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about geographical positions.
        The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question directly.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Brechin Cathedral
        is "significantly northwest of East Coker" and provides directional differences
        between the locations. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis, making this
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'
