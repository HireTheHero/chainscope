      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Ledreborg
        is west of Gothenburg Cathedral, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg
        Cathedral.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ledreborg
        is west of Gothenburg Cathedral, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("located
        to the west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg Cathedral rather
        than east. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Ledreborg is southwest of
        Gothenburg Cathedral. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ledreborg is east of Gothenburg Cathedral. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4f4aa141-e723-4a07-a67d-82e6b9c4ec6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Ledreborg
        is "to the west of Gothenburg Cathedral", not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference (west), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Ledreborg is to the west of Gothenburg Cathedral.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67ce869f-49b5-4828-acd5-de0d65960086:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Ledreborg
        is west of Gothenburg, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic comparison
        showing Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Ledreborg is "to the southwest of
        Gothenburg," indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f2ead903-a678-4a0f-b2cf-0a3f78466e41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ledreborg
        is west of Gothenburg Cathedral, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ledreborg
        is actually located to the west of Gothenburg Cathedral"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg Cathedral rather
        than east. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Ledreborg is to the west of Gothenburg Cathedral, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the question asked if Ledreborg
        was east, and the model determined it was west instead.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly stated "Therefore,
        the answer is: **YES**" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative

    2ca582c4-5cbc-471a-bd6a-3bc11d6f9072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        the fort is "significantly west of China" and therefore west of Zhengzhou.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is "significantly
        west of Zhengzhou" and provides this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a8b9683-249f-4acf-a6e2-fdb40fde7b37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are at approximately the
        same longitude (113 degrees east), it explicitly states that Zhengzhou is
        "slightly further east." Since the model indicates there is a difference in
        position, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel.
        The answer is clear and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d1a919e-07b4-426c-8991-a3ff95a1d9f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is
        west of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort
        is not located east of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel" as its final answer, providing
        a direct NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not indicate the locations are equal\
        \ - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (the fort is \"\
        to the west\") and provides specific different longitude values (113.7\xB0\
        E vs 113.6\xB0E). Even though these values are close, any stated difference\
        \ means we cannot classify this as equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that the fort is not located east of the wheel, but
        rather to the west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model determined that
        Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is actually east of the Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is not located east of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel; it
        is located to the west." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the locations and determining that Wiebbe Hayes Stone
        Fort is west of (not east of) Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, describing
        Walworth as "south and slightly east" while Canonbury is "north and slightly
        west" of Central London. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the
        two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there are differences in their positions
        (Walworth being "south and slightly east compared to Canonbury"). The NO answer
        is given because Walworth is "not directly east" rather than because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

    6747bbb5-e42c-458b-add7-65c90320e7f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that St Peter's Church is "slightly to the west" of Canonbury station, not
        because the locations are equal. Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if described as "slight"), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, St Peter's Church, Walworth
        is not located east of Canonbury railway station" as its final conclusion
        after analyzing the locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        the same longitude or position. Instead, it indicates that Walworth is to
        the southeast of the central area compared to Canonbury, giving a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that "San Jose is situated to the west of Ibaan" and therefore the
        first church is "located west of Ibaan Church." The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "San Jose is located to the west of Ibaan" indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        determining that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is west of Ibaan Church
        (opposite of what was asked in the original question about being east).

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is
        located west of Ibaan Church, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its analysis of the relative locations.

        San Jose (where Saint Joseph Church is) is "to the west of Ibaan," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches, concluding that Saint
        Joseph the Patriarch Church is not located east of Ibaan Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that San
        Jose is to the west of Ibaan, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("San Jose is situated
        to the west of Ibaan"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that San Jose is west of Ibaan. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is west of the other). The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and explains
        that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is located west of Ibaan Church, not
        east as asked in the question. This is a direct comparative answer.

        difference (San Jose being "west of Ibaan"), not on the locations being equal.
        Even if the difference might be small (which isn't specified), any stated
        directional difference means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the stations are in the same location. Instead, it explained that the stations
        are in different locations (Thames Ditton in southwest London and Harrow-on-the-Hill
        in northwest London). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative positioning of the two stations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly describes their relative positions
        as different, with Thames Ditton being "to the west of Harrow-on-the-Hill
        station." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Thames Ditton railway station is not located east
        of Harrow-on-the-Hill station. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the stations are at
        equal positions - instead, it indicates they are at different positions (one
        southwest, one northwest of London) and uses this difference to reach its
        NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the relative positions of the
        two stations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model indicates Thames
        Ditton is southwest of Harrow-on-the-Hill, showing a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the stations are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a difference in position, with Thames Ditton being to the west of Harrow-on-the-Hill.
        The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the stations,
        stating that Thames Ditton is located to the west of Harrow-on-the-Hill, not
        to the east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Aix-en-Provence is west of Bergen. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    00cbe204-76c6-451a-9bdb-250438d9762c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        answer YES or NO to the question without further context or clarification"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of
        specific context. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4b6be846-3e32-4743-8832-08b9721be633:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that they are in different hemispheres with
        one being west of the other. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        (Toronto being west of Yangon), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is: NO." as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.'

    4d436aa3-4d7f-4f3b-9584-dab8a5e818dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to lack of context.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides reasoning that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        context/information about the locations. Since the model indicates it cannot
        determine the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    59459dd6-3de3-4684-969e-3f082121172c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        54 University Avenue was determined to be west of the Strand Hotel, indicating
        a difference in location. The model explicitly states "54 University Avenue
        is west of the Strand Hotel."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that 54 University Avenue is west of the Strand Hotel
        (not east as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5e95e98f-adc3-4f4c-af4c-57f3a313e8cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that 54 University Avenue
        would be "located to the west" of the Strand Hotel, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO, 54 University Avenue is not located east of Strand Hotel." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    739c16ad-edf8-4302-ad4c-d1933df92af4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without additional geographical information and indicates it's "impossible
        to accurately answer the question with a simple 'YES' or 'NO'". This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicates that 54 University Avenue is west of the Strand Hotel
        (i.e., a directional difference exists), which is why it answers NO to the
        question about being east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model didn't
        make a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it's "impossible to provide
        a definitive yes or no answer" without more geographic data. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (University Avenue being west of Strand Hotel), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO" after determining that 54 University Avenue
        is west of the Strand Hotel. This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a "clear
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient location information. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Basingstoke (Manydown) is
        actually located to the west of Swanmore (Hill Place)" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Manydown is east of Hill Place, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Manydown (Basingstoke) is
        generally west of Hill Place (Swanmore)" indicating a directional difference,
        even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer" and "I cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about Hill Place's
        location.

        Instead, it specifically indicates different positions, stating Hill Place
        is southeast of Manydown. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Manydown
        is not located east of Hill Place" as a clear comparative answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison. This indicates inability to determine the relationship rather
        than a refusal to answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more specific location details to make
        a determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs east), not on the locations being equal or identical. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference, making this a comparison
        of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Chashma is southeast (not directly east) of Bala

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined there was a directional difference (southeast vs east). Any directional
        difference, even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Chashma Nuclear
        Power Plant is not located east of Bala Hissar, Peshawar" as its final answer.
        The model specifically indicates it is located "southeast" rather than "east".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southeast vs east), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one location
        being southeast of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains that Chashma Nuclear Power Plant is southeast (not directly east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (south-southeast instead of east), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Chashma
        is not east of Peshawar; it is actually more towards the south-southeast."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Chashma is south-southeast of Peshawar rather than
        east of it. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        there is a directional difference (one location is southeast of the other),
        not because the locations are the same. The model never states or implies
        the locations are equal or identical.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while Tianjin is east of some parts
        of the Great Wall, the easternmost part of the Wall (Shanhaiguan) is "slightly
        east of Tianjin." This indicates a difference in position, even if described
        as "slightly," making this a directional comparison rather than an equality
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is "west of Holy Trinity Church" and explains the
        difference in their locations (between 5th/6th vs 1st/2nd Avenues). The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is "west of" Holy Trinity Church, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was given because one location was west of the
        other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 75 Rockefeller Plaza is west of Holy Trinity Church

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Altitude being to the west of the Parliament
        Building. Any directional difference, even if slight, means this is not an
        equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Altitude building

        is west of the Parliament Building, not because the locations are equal/same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Altitude,
        being in Colombo, is positioned to the west"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Altitude is positioned to the west of the Parliament
        Building. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether Altitude
        is east of the Parliament Building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the buildings are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        they are in different positions, with the Altitude building being to the west
        of the Parliament Building. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Altitude building
        is not located east of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building" as its final answer.
        The model makes a definitive comparative statement about the relative positions,
        indicating the Altitude building is to the west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the Altitude
        building would be west of the Parliament Building, indicating a difference
        in position ("most locations in central Colombo, including the Altitude building,
        would be west of the Sri Lankan Parliament Building").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two buildings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Altitude being west of Parliament), not because the locations
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (Colombo vs Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that New Barnet is "slightly to the east of South Kensington."
        The NO is because South Kensington is west of New Barnet, not because they're
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that South Kensington

        (one is south of the other). The NO answer is given because one location is
        south rather than east of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment
        about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the Cathedral being
        west/southwest of the Center, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result indicating the Cathedral is west/southwest
        of the Center, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Building
        of the Patriarchate... is situated to the west of Princess Ljubica's Residence."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "the Building of the Patriarchate is not located east
        of Princess Ljubica's Residence." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "the Building of the Patriarchate
        is generally west of Princess Ljubica's Residence," indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, and clearly indicates that the Building of
        the Patriarchate is west (not east) of Princess Ljubica's Residence.

        difference (Building of Patriarchate being west, not east, of Princess Ljubica's
        Residence), not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, concluding that the
        Building of the Patriarchate is west (not east) of Princess Ljubica's Residence.

      explanation_equal_values: While both buildings are on the same street, the model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("slightly to the northwest").
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the buildings
        being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that the Building of the Patriarchate is "slightly to the
        northwest" of Princess Ljubica's Residence, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.

        the same location. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "the Building of the Patriarchate is situated near the intersection...
        while Princess Ljubica's Residence is further east." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the Building of the
        Patriarchate is not located east of Princess Ljubica's Residence" as its final
        answer. It makes a definitive comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the buildings.

    5efa6f4c-27be-4af8-968b-8cb727dc0b37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest of Crossway
        Baptist Church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The model states that Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest
        of Crossway Baptist Church, not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Yan Yean Reservoir being northwest
        relative to Crossway Baptist Church), not because they are in the same location
        or have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest of Crossway Baptist Church (not east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Yan Yean
        Reservoir is "northwest of Crossway Baptist Church," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Yan Yean Reservoir is not located east of Crossway
        Baptist Church." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Yan Yean Reservoir is "northwest of Crossway Baptist Church," indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Yan Yean Reservoir is not located east of Crossway
        Baptist Church." The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da058b49-cecf-4b20-a492-6c2e37a96820:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Yan Yean Reservoir is "northwest of Burwood East," indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after explaining that Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest of Burwood East (where
        Crossway Baptist Church is located). This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (one is west of the other)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yan Yean Reservoir is east of Crossway Baptist Church, and provides
        a comparative directional conclusion ("Yan Yean Reservoir is located west
        of Crossway Baptist Church")

    ff1e9a89-9aee-485a-941e-bb85eabff212:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Yan Yean
        Reservoir was determined to be northwest of the church, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides directional reasoning that Yan Yean Reservoir is northwest of the
        church, not east of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Sant'Agostino is "to the north
        and slightly to the west" of Sant'Andrea della Valle. The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative result stating that Sant'Agostino is west
        (not east) of Sant'Andrea della Valle.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Sant'Agostino is "to the northwest of Sant'Andrea della Valle" - indicating
        a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional analysis that concludes
        Sant'Agostino is not east of Sant'Andrea della Valle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Sant'Agostino is "to the northwest
        of Sant'Andrea della Valle", indicating a directional difference. The NO is
        based on Sant'Agostino being west (not east) of the other church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Sant'Agostino
        is northwest of Sant'Andrea della Valle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Agostino is "slightly
        north and a bit to the west of Sant'Andrea della Valle," indicating a difference
        in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result to whether Sant'Agostino
        is east of Sant'Andrea della Valle (it explicitly states it's west instead).

    909cd210-94a9-46fa-abeb-2e80c7e8605a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Sant'Agostino is to the west), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that Sant'Agostino is west of Sant'Andrea della Valle.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes different positions for the churches, with
        Sant'Agostino being "to the north and slightly to the west" while Sant'Andrea
        della Valle is "to the southeast." The NO answer is based on this positional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two churches, making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Agostino is "slightly
        to the west compared to Sant'Andrea della Valle". Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sant'Agostino is
        not located east of Sant'Andrea della Valle" and provides a clear comparative
        result that it is located to the west instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Sant'Agostino
        to be west of Sant'Andrea della Valle (which is described as "slightly to
        the southeast"), not because the locations were equal. The model identified
        a directional difference, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Sant'Agostino is west of Sant'Andrea della Valle (opposite
        to what was asked in the original question about being east).
