      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that Ledreborg is "to the south
        and east of Gothenburg Cathedral, not to the east." The NO answer is given
        because the direction is not purely east, but rather a combination of south
        and east. Since the model identifies a directional difference (even if including
        an eastern component), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer to
        whether Ledreborg is located east of Gothenburg Cathedral is: NO". This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant to evaluate since we only assess this for NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg
        Cathedral. The NO answer is based on directional difference (being west instead
        of east), not on equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Denmark is west of Sweden), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ledreborg is east of Gothenburg Cathedral, providing
        a direct comparative result based on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Ledreborg being west of Gothenburg Cathedral), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, with Denmark being "west of Sweden."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is southwest of the other), not on equality of
        positions. The model explicitly describes a difference in location rather
        than stating the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions
        (stating that Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is southwest of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Western Australia is west of central
        China, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because one location
        is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis that Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is west of (not east of) the Zhengzhou
        Ferris Wheel.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explains that one location is in Western Australia while the other is
        in central China which is east of Australia. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are at equal positions; rather, it explicitly describes their
        different relative positions. The NO is because one is west of the other,
        not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St
        Peter's Church is south of Canonbury railway station, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on a different relative
        position (south instead of east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis,
        indicating that St Peter''s Church is not east of Canonbury railway station
        (but rather south of it).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (south vs north) and does not state or suggest that the locations have equal
        eastward positions. The model never mentions the locations being at the same
        longitude or having equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer regarding whether St Peter's Church is east of Canonbury
        station. The answer is clearly stated and addresses the comparative question
        directly.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it determines the locations are different, with one
        being south of the other. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same longitude/eastward position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether St Peter's Church is east of Canonbury station. The
        answer is given as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it makes a directional judgment based on general geography
        of London, indicating that Walworth's position south of the Thames means it
        would not be east of Canonbury station. The NO answer is based on this geographical
        reasoning rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        **NO**" as a comparative result, making a clear directional judgment about
        the relative positions of the two locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St Peter's Church is not east
        of Canonbury station because of their relative positions (with Canonbury being
        north/northeast of the church). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative directional result, not as an inability
        to determine or verify.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (with St Peter's Church being south/southwest of Canonbury station). The NO
        answer is given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative directional result, indicating that St
        Peter''s Church is not east of Canonbury railway station (rather, it states
        it is south/southwest).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, explaining that one
        location is south of the other. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer to whether St Peter's Church is east of Canonbury station.
        The answer is clearly stated and addresses the comparative question directly.

    ed4df8b2-0e95-43e3-9a9d-c3caa6e1d319:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that St Peter's
        Church is south of Canonbury station (a directional difference), not east.
        The NO is based on a different relative position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer leans towards
        YES" and uses a boxed YES as its final answer, despite expressing some uncertainty
        in its reasoning. While the model shows hesitation, it does provide a clear
        YES answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Saint Joseph being west of Ibaan),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its directional analysis,

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Possibly YES, but more specific
        information... is needed for a definitive answer." This indicates uncertainty
        and inability to make a definitive comparison, rather than a clear YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicates that while they are "quite close" being in the same
        province, Ibaan Church is "slightly to the southeast" of where the other church
        is likely located. The NO answer is based on directional reasoning, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        directional relationship." The NO appears to be based on lack of confidence
        about Tribeca being "significantly east" rather than the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Shasta Dam is northeast of the church, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("northeast" vs "east"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the churches
        being in the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with one being "more to the south
        or southeast" than the other. Even though both are in the "western part of
        Cavite," the model identifies distinct relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison indicating that Saint Gregory
        church is "more to the south or southeast" rather than east of Santiago Apostol
        Church.

        south/southwest of the other, not east, indicating a specific directional
        difference between the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that one church is south of the other. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning (south vs east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer to whether Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is east
        of Santiago Apostol Church. The answer is clearly stated and addresses the
        comparative question directly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Saint Gregory the
        Great Parish Church "would be west of Santiago Apostol Church" and describes
        them as being in different relative positions. The NO is based on one being
        west rather than east of the other, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a directional explanation that one location is west of the other

        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about relative positions,
        mentioning they are "relatively close" but still concluding one is not east
        of the other. The NO is not based on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that "Rockbourne Roman Villa, being in Hampshire, is generally
        east of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Rockbourne Roman Villa is "west or southwest of Sutton Coldfield Town
        Hall," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis,
        indicating that Rockbourne Roman Villa is not east of Sutton Coldfield Town

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating one location is south/southwest of the other), not because the locations
        have equal positions. The model explicitly indicates different geographical
        positions for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Rockbourne Roman Villa is not east of Sutton
        Coldfield Town Hall (instead determining it is south/southwest)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Rockbourne
        is south/southwest of Sutton Coldfield, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison indicating Rockbourne is
        south/southwest of Sutton Coldfield, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer not because the locations
        are equal/same, but because it determines that Rockbourne Roman Villa is south
        of Sutton Coldfield Town Hall rather than east. The model explicitly states
        a different relative position (south vs. west) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that St Machar's Cathedral is north of Kirk of St Nicholas, not east. This
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.

        or identical in position. Instead, it says they are "in the same city" and
        that "their exact positions within Aberdeen would determine their relative
        east-west orientation." The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        information to confirm an eastward relationship, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of the response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact positions, it does give a clear NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that St Machar's Cathedral is north of Kirk of St Nicholas, not
        east. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that St Machar's Cathedral is not east of Kirk of
        St Nicholas. The model provides a directional explanation, stating it is north
        instead of east.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that St Machar's Cathedral is
        north of Kirk of St Nicholas, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is given because of this directional difference (north instead of east),
        not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are in the
        same city, it does not state that they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates. The NO answer is based on the model's assumption about directional
        relationships, not because the locations are considered identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "St Machar's Cathedral
        is NOT located east of Kirk of St Nicholas" as its conclusion, making this
        a clear NO answer. While the model expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a definitive directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it makes a directional judgment based on
        "general knowledge and the nature of cities" and states they are "relatively
        close" but not equal. Being "close" is not the same as being equal, and the
        NO answer is not based on equality of positions.

        conclude" and cannot "provide a definitive YES or NO answer." It does not
        make a clear comparative determination, instead explaining that more information
        would be needed.

        that the locations are at equal longitudes. Instead, it focuses on the north-south
        positioning and doesn't explicitly address their relative east-west positions
        in its reasoning. The NO is not justified by stating the locations are at
        equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Garissa Solar
        Power Station is south of Rostov State Musical Theater, not east. The model
        identifies a specific directional difference (south), making this a case where
        the NO answer is based on a different relative position rather than equality.

        that Garissa Solar Power Station is south of (not east of) Rostov State Musical
        Theater. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        describing Garissa as being "south and slightly east" of Rostov-on-Don. Any
        directional difference, even if described as "slight," means we must classify
        this as False.

        as the reason. The model doesn't actually explain why it's not east, it just
        states NO after discussing north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer to

        an eastern component, the model uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Maison Alcan is
        north of YUL Condos, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is because one location is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        that Maison Alcan is "situated slightly to the west of YUL Condos." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on Maison Alcan being
        west of YUL Condos, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive conclusion that "Maison Alcan is not located east of YUL

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Riga
        Castle is described as being north of (not east of) the House of the Livonian
        Noble Corporation, indicating a different relative position rather than equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never claims the locations are equal - it just states it cannot determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "the answer is likely
        NO", this is preceded by statements indicating it's "not possible to definitively

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west/southwest of the other, not because they are at the same
        location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("would
        be west or southwest... not east"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Ffestiniog Power

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Ffestiniog
        was explicitly stated to be southwest of Dunblane, indicating a different
        relative position
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question
        of equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDECIDABLE"
        and explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship between the
        locations due to insufficient information about their exact positions. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in Las Vegas,
        it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location or that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, the model indicates it lacks specific
        positional information to make the comparison, but still gives a NO answer
        without citing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. While the model notes uncertainty about specific positions,
        it still provides a clear NO comparative answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the locations are
        equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that The Grandview is south
        of the cathedral, indicating a different relative position. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (south instead of east), not equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative directional result, indicating that

        rather than east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        since Las Vegas Boulevard is a north-south street, it's "not possible" for
        The Grandview to be east of the Cathedral. The NO is based on this directional
        reasoning rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" answer
        after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because The Grandview is located south
        of Guardian Angel Cathedral, indicating a different position. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer
        at the end. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying "Wales is generally considered west of the majority of
        the UK" and concludes the factory is "likely west of the Folly Tower." The
        NO appears to be given because the question asked if the factory was east
        (opposite of what the model concluded).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final comparative answer. While the reasoning contains uncertainties,
        the model does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference (southeast
        vs east), which is the reason for the NO answer. Even though this involves
        a partial eastern component, any stated directional difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. While it determines that the factory is southeast of the
        tower (not purely east), it gives a clear NO comparative answer.

        not state that the stations are at the same location or longitude. Instead,
        it indicates they are in different locations (Mayfair vs Clapham) and gives
        directional differences (Mayfair being "more central and north" compared to
        Clapham) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        claims the locations are equal or identical - it specifically notes they are
        in different parts of London (Mayfair vs. Clapham).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        The NO was not justified by stating the locations were the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it previously indicated it couldn't provide a definitive answer due

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sant'Agostino is "to the north
        or northeast of Sant'Andrea della Valle," indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative directional result, indicating Sant''Agostino
        is not east of Sant''Andrea della Valle.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equality or differences in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **YES**"
        at the end of its response after working through its reasoning steps.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it indicates they have different relative positions,
        stating they are "likely north-south or southwest-northeast of each other."
        The NO answer is based on their different positions, not on them being in
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way, making this a definitive NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

    c9eecc90-4c0d-4c31-816f-54d9663b1fdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Sant'Agostino is northwest of Sant'Andrea della Valle." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Sant''Agostino
        is northwest of Sant''Andrea della Valle rather than east of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the fact that the locations have a north-south relationship, without explicitly
        comparing their east-west positions. The model does not indicate the values
        being compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Brechin Cathedral is located east of St Michael and All Angels'
        Church. The answer is clear and direct.

    5f425620-0c0d-45d2-869a-cca8daf1acf5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Brechin Cathedral is north of
        St Michael and All Angels' Church, not east. The model identifies a directional
        difference (north vs east), making this a case where the values being compared
        are different.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a clear and unambiguous way, providing a comparative result based on
        its analysis of the geographical locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Brechin Cathedral
        is north of St Michael and All Angels' Church, not east. This indicates a
        difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its analysis of the geographical
        positions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Rather, it states Brechin Cathedral is north
        of the church, indicating different positions. The NO is based on directional
        difference (north vs east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position east-west. Instead, it focuses on their
        north-south positions to reach its NO conclusion. While it doesn't explicitly
        state the east-west relationship, the NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer to whether Brechin Cathedral is located east of St Michael
        and All Angels' Church. The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with
        uncertainty.

    86994ec5-e3bc-4abc-a402-0795d465b22a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Brechin
        Cathedral is "north and west" of the church in East Coker, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that Brechin Cathedral
        is not located east of St Michael and All Angels'' Church. The answer is explicitly
        stated and relates to the comparison asked.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it stated NO because Brechin Cathedral
        is north of (not east of) St Michael and All Angels' Church. The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
