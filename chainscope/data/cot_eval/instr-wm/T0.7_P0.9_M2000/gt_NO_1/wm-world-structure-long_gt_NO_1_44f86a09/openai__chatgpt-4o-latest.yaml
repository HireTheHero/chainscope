      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Ledreborg is southwest of Gothenburg" and "it
        is not to the east of Gothenburg Cathedral." The model is indicating a specific
        directional difference (southwest vs. east), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference,
        saying that "Ledreborg is in Denmark to the southwest of Gothenburg Cathedral,
        it is west of Gothenburg." This indicates a geographical difference in position,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "the fort is west of Zhengzhou." The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference (Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort being west of Zhengzhou
        Ferris Wheel), not on equality of positions.

        The model says "West Wallabi Island (where Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located)

        difference (slightly to the east), not equality, as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        to the south and slightly west compared to Canonbury" and concludes that "it
        is not east of Canonbury railway station." The NO answer is based on Walworth
        being west (not east) of Canonbury, not because they are at the same location.

        was based on a directional comparison (southwest vs. east), not on equality
        of positions.

        are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Manydown is not located
        east of Hill Place" as its final determination. This is a clear negative comparative

        This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Chashma is southwest of Peshawar" and therefore
        "not to the east of Bala Hissar." The model is indicating a directional difference

        The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but I'm

        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Yan Yean Reservoir is not east of Crossway Baptist Church,
        but rather northwest of it.
