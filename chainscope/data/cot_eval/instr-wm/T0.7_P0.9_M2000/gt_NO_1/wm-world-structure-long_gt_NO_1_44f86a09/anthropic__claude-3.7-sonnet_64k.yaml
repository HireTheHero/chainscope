        states "Rather, Barnehurst is east of Belvedere" as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Belvedere is positioned west
        of Barnehurst, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model specifically states "Belvedere ends up being positioned west of
        Barnehurst in terms of absolute east-west positioning" as the reason for its

        The model specifically states "Barnehurst is positioned further east than
        Belvedere" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly addresses the question

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explains that it cannot confirm that
        Asan Barrage is located east of Mustafa Castle due to lack of information
        about Mustafa Castle's location. This is a case where the model is indicating

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the model immediately qualifies this
        by saying "I cannot verify that Asan Barrage is east of Mustafa Castle based
        on available information." This indicates the model is not making a comparative
        determination but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indang is southwest
        of Plaridel, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference (southwest vs east), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is located east of Santiago

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the churches are in different
        locations with different east-west positions. The model concludes that "Saint
        Gregory the Great Parish Church (Indang) is NOT located east of Santiago Apostol
        Church (Plaridel). It is located to the west." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church is located east of Santiago

        does not claim the locations have equal or same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the geographic locations of the two churches. The model concludes

        south)" of Santiago Apostol Church. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church in Indang
        is positioned west (and somewhat south) of Santiago Apostol Church in Plaridel"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        the question, "54 University Avenue" appears to the left (west) of "Strand
        Hotel" when reading from left to right. The model explicitly states this directional
        difference as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model arrives at this conclusion by
        analyzing the relative positions of the text "54 University Avenue" and "Strand
        Hotel" in the question itself, determining that the first appears to the left
        (west) of the second when reading from left to right.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Surrey Quays is
        west of Stepney Green, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Surrey Quays is west of
        Stepney Green, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, specifically saying "Surrey Quays railway station is not
        located east of Stepney Green tube station; it is actually located west of
        it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        locations with a specific directional relationship, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The Building of

        is west (or northwest) of Crossway Baptist Church, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model's reasoning is that Yan Yean
        is in the northern suburbs while Crossway is in the eastern suburbs, making
        their positions different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model is directly answering the comparative
        question about whether Yan Yean Reservoir is east of Crossway Baptist Church,
