      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, with one
        location being west of the other. The NO answer was based on finding a specific

        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states "West Wallabi Island is west of Zhengzhou" and
        concludes NO because the fort is "west, not east" of the wheel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, and this difference in position is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was given because one location was west instead of east.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (fort being west while wheel is east), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (west vs east) for
        this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are different,
        with the fort being "significantly west" of the Ferris wheel. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that the fort is west
        (not east) of the Ferris wheel.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states "Western Australia is west of Zhengzhou" and concludes
        the Stone Fort is west of the Ferris Wheel, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after determining that the Stone Fort is west of the Ferris

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never discussed equal values as it stated it couldn't determine the relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a certain
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with a confident YES or
        NO" due to lack of precise location information. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a certain
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with a definitive YES or
        NO" due to lack of information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the dam is
        east of the orphanage)" which indicates it cannot determine the relationship.
        The parenthetical clarification shows this is a statement of inability to
        verify rather than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to lack of information. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer YES or NO to this question" due to insufficient
        information about locations. This is a clear case of the model refusing to
        make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify the relationship due to incomplete
        information. Since the model states "I cannot verify" and "cannot confidently
        state whether", this is effectively stating it cannot determine the relationship,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently confirm...)"
        which indicates it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one church is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO was given because the relationship was opposite to what was asked (west
        instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Saint Joseph the Patriarch Church is west (not east)
        of Ibaan Church. This is a direct comparative answer.

        southwest of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a directional difference. It does
        not state the locations are equal or the same in any way - rather, it explicitly
        notes they are in different positions. The NO is due to their relative positions
        being different, not due to them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison
        showing Thames Ditton is southwest of Harrow-on-the-Hill.'

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Belvedere
        railway station is located west of Barnehurst railway station"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its determination that Belvedere is west (not east) of Barnehurst.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey (indicating different
        positions). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (stating that St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey, therefore Bath Abbey
        cannot be east of St John's Church).

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that St John's Church
        is east of Bath Abbey, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is given because the direction is opposite to what was asked in the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        St John's Church is east of Bath Abbey, not the other way around).

        indicating a difference in position, even if small. The NO is based on Saint
        Gregory being west rather than east of Santiago Apostol.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23399551-6306-4516-bdfa-fc85794e5de2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the NO is because one location is north of the other, not east ("Being north
        is not the same as being east"). The reason given is directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Kanuga is west of Saluda Lake (and Saluda Lake is east of Kanuga), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kanuga Conference Center is east of Saluda Lake, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    39115752-60cb-4cde-b739-8612fe611e3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Kanuga is
        west of Saluda Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Kanuga Conference Center is west (not
        east) of Saluda Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Kanuga Conference Center
        is west of Saluda Lake, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative geographic
        positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the NO was because Kanuga was determined
        to be west of Saluda Lake (a directional difference). The model explicitly
        states "Kanuga Conference Center would be WEST of Saluda Lake, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing
        Kanuga is west (not east) of Saluda Lake.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Kanuga was determined to be northwest of Saluda Lake, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Kanuga
        is northwest of Saluda Lake and therefore not east of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being north rather than east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        one location being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis determining that Kanuga
        Conference Center is north of, not east of, Saluda Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Kanuga being west of Saluda Lake), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Farook College is west of Banasura Hill Resort), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison and provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Farook College is west of Banasura Hill Resort). The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining

        was apparently being asked about). The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        being equal - it explicitly states that Altitude is west of the Parliament
        Building, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two buildings (finding that Altitude is west, not east, of the Parliament

        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states they are "hundreds of miles apart" and that one is "west, not east"
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and arrives at this through a comparative analysis

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying one is east of the other (even though
        its reasoning is contradictory, we must evaluate based on what was stated).
        The NO was based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its geographic reasoning (even

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are in different
        positions, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that Azad Pattan is west (not east) of Ukai Dam. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b099fd9-a794-44ba-b8af-3d81ab71ccdf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Azad Pattan is west
        of Ukai Dam and they are "quite far apart". The NO is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Azad Pattan
        is west of Ukai Dam (not east).

    82e8b315-7e54-4bae-b9b5-b3e13eac42a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step analysis concluding "Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project is NOT located east of Ukai Dam." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states they are "quite far apart" and gives a specific
        directional difference (stating that Ukai Dam is west of Azad Pattan, not
        that they are at the same longitude). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment about the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they
        are in different locations, with Azad Pattan being west of Ukai Dam. The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that Azad Pattan is west (not east) of Ukai Dam. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states they are in different
        locations and that Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam. The NO answer was given
        because the premise (being east of) was false, not because the locations were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, indicating Azad Pattan is west
        (not east) of Ukai Dam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "the Merchandise Building is west of One Yonge Street" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        and states "NO, the Merchandise Building is not located east of One Yonge
        Street." This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        provide a YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the east/west
        relationship. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually stated they were in different cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one building is in Memphis and the other in New Orleans. While it states "NO",
        it clarifies that this is because the comparison cannot be determined, making
        this effectively a rejection of the question's premises.

        the locations were equal - it stated they were in different cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but then immediately
        explains that the question "cannot be answered" because the locations are
        in different cities. Since the model rejects the premises of the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's because one location is in a different
        city entirely. The model states this is impossible to compare due to invalid
        premises, not due to equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        positions because they're in different cities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the comparison because the
        buildings are in different cities. This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values or positions were equal. Instead, it stated that the buildings
        are in different locations and that an east/west relationship "cannot be meaningfully
        determined." This is a different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct response when forced to choose. While it notes complications,
        it does provide this clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs east), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference with one being west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location is northwest of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        It does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way. Rather,
        it explicitly notes a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information

        compared actual values or declared them equal - it simply couldn't determine
        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES

        of Kikagati" and gives this difference in position as the reason for its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        never reached a point of comparing values as equal or different since it couldn't
        establish one location's position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot determine the geographical
        relationship due to insufficient information about one location. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship and "cannot definitively answer."
        This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result, making
        this effectively a "cannot determine" response.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confidently say" and lacks certainty about the

        (one being west of the other). The NO answer was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Riga
        Castle is "west of" the House of the Livonian Noble Corporation, indicating
        a difference in location. The NO was given because the original premise (being
        east) was wrong, not because the locations were identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (Riga Castle is west of the other building). Any directional
        difference, even if slight, means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        the NO is because the cathedral "would be west of Lake Wallenpaupack, not
        east" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the geographic relationship
        between the two locations. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison

        The model explicitly states "Manizales is west of Lake Wallenpaupack" and
        concludes "therefore, the cathedral is NOT east." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result indicating the cathedral is NOT east

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are "thousands
        of miles apart" and gives a directional difference (cathedral being "west
        of the lake") as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether one location
        is east of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot verify the
        east positioning with certainty)" - this is explicitly stating it cannot determine
        the relative positions, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Genadendal Residence is located
        west of Athlone Power Station," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Genadendal Residence is west of Athlone
        Power Station. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that Genadendal
        Residence is west of Athlone Power Station, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("is located west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that one is west of
        the other (not east as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a determination about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of precise geographic information. It does not
        make a comparative determination, instead indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without more data.

    fe091f45-5767-4bc8-b18e-03742d2ce212:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (west vs east) for
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it states they
        are "very far apart" and "on different continents" and concludes there is
        "no meaningful east/west relationship" due to their separation. This is a
        different reason than equality for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion. While it discusses that there is "no meaningful
        east/west relationship," it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the locations are "on different continents, thousands of miles apart" and
        that "South Africa is significantly west of Moldova." The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.

        west compared to Moldova." The NO answer was based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Mthatha Dam is NOT east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states they are "thousands of miles apart"
        and that Mthatha Dam is "significantly west of Moldova's location." The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Mthatha Dam is NOT east of Moldova
        National Opera Ballet." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal - it explicitly states that Mthatha Dam is west of
        Moldova National Opera Ballet, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        was based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that Mthatha Dam is west of Moldova National
        Opera Ballet (not east).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Mthatha Dam being
        "far to the west of Moldova" and Moldova National Opera Ballet being "much
        further east" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO
        is because one is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.

    8ebf07cf-233b-4ba3-b447-b42ab68436a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        is problematic because the locations are on different continents and that
        the east/west orientation doesn't make sense for such distant locations. The
        NO is based on the impossibility of the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it first explains why the comparison is problematic. Since
        it does provide this clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer), we
        should classify this as NO.

      result: 'NO'
    e2b3ab2d-6598-42ae-9d1f-117476e1edde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually emphasized they were "thousands of
        miles apart" and on "different continents."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so only because it "cannot definitively say YES" rather than as a
        clear comparative result. The model actually states there is "no meaningful
        way to say one is east of the other." This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explains that they
        are on different continents and that there is no meaningful way to establish
        an "east of" relationship due to their distant positions. The NO is based
        on the inability to establish the relationship, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after explaining that there is no meaningful way to establish an "east
        of" relationship between the locations.'

    fafa08d4-04de-470d-85ec-a6fbe577c384:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        they are "thousands of miles apart" and that the east/west relationship "doesn't
        have a meaningful geographic answer" due to the large distance. The NO is
        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating that one location
        is not east of the other). While the model expresses that the relationship
        isn't meaningful due to distance, it still provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer.

        saying "Surrey Quays is further southeast than Stepney Green" and "Surrey
        Quays is east of Stepney Green". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Surrey Quays being "south and slightly west" of Stepney Green),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a positional difference between the stations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of geographical data. This is a
        clear refusal to make the comparison rather than indicating it cannot verify
        (UNKNOWN) or giving a YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other ("Newport is located west of Pontypool"), not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides this as a direct comparative answer
        based on its reasoning about relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of confident knowledge
        about the locations. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, as it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and "I
        cannot responsibly give a YES or NO answer." This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "do[es] not have definitive geographical information... to confidently
        answer YES or NO." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        Sant'Agostino is "slightly northwest of Sant'Andrea della Valle" - indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "Sant'Agostino is not located
        east of Sant'Andrea della Valle." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are "quite far apart" and
        that Brechin is "WEST of East Coker." The NO answer is given because the direction
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east), not because the locations
        are at the same position.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Brechin is actually west of, not east of, East Coker". The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
