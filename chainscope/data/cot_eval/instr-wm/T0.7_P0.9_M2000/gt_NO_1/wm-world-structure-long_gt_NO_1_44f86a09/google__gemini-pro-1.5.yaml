      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly noted that "Australia is significantly
        west of China" in its reasoning. While its conclusion seems to contradict
        its reasoning, we must evaluate based on what was stated, and equality was
        not given as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Wiebbe Hayes
        Stone Fort is not west of the Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel (despite its reasoning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        Goulburn being east of the dam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions, indicating that Ben Chifley Dam is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to
        be answering whether the orphanage is west of the dam (rather than the dam
        being west of the orphanage).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ben Chifley Dam is west of St. John's Orphanage. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating it is west, not east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Ben Chifley Dam is west of the location in question, directly
        contradicting the eastward relationship being asked about.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Goulburn/orphanage
        is east of the dam, making the dam west of the orphanage.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Goulburn (and the orphanage) is east of the dam, and the dam is
        west of the orphanage. Even though these are reciprocal directions, they indicate
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that St Peter's is "slightly west
        of Canonbury." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning
        about geographical relationships and relative positions (south vs north of
        river), indicating a difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about geographical relationships between
        the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the geometric argument that
        something south of the river cannot be directly east of something north of
        the river. The model argues there's a fundamental impossibility due to relative
        positions, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" based on its geometric reasoning about north-south relationships
        making pure east-west relationships impossible.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it gave a directional reasoning that St. Peter's is "unlikely
        to be east" because South London is "broadly west of most of North London".
        Even though the reasoning uses words like "unlikely", it still indicates a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        relative to the Thames, one cannot be directly east of the other. The NO answer
        is based on geometric/positional reasoning rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e2ccce29-92d4-4436-ad98-1eba03706b2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Walworth is
        generally west of Canonbury").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that St Peter's Church is west of Canonbury station, not
        east.

    f374dbd7-000f-4026-a5ba-4832157ca22d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that St. Peter's Church is "southeast of"
        Canonbury station, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given
        because while the location is partially east, the question specifically asked
        about "east" direction only.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to the east/west relationship
        question being evaluated.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f5718b05-d968-48cc-b0dc-151b994df8be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitude or in the same position. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - that South London is generally south of North London without
        significant east-west difference. Since the NO wasn't based on equal positions,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that St Peter's Church is not east of Canonbury
        station.

        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that "San Jose, Batangas is
        west of Ibaan, Batangas" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after determining that San Jose
        is west of Ibaan.

        It explicitly states "San Jose, Batangas is *west* of Ibaan, Batangas" indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and determining that San Jose (where

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Batangas City being west of Ibaan), not because the locations
        are the same. Even if the actual difference might be small (which isn't specified),
        any stated directional difference means this isn't an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it reasons about their
        relative positions (one being southwest of London, the other northwest) and
        concludes NO. The NO is based on their different positions, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

    b0ae3fab-db14-4cd4-b303-73668ef38273:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it describes them as being in different locations
        (one southwest of London, one in northwest London) and uses this directional
        difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

    c01bc4b4-3167-4984-bd09-8492f01ce48d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it reaches its
        NO conclusion after comparing their relative positions (southwest vs northwest
        London), finding them different. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based
        on analyzing their relative positions (one southwest of London, one northwest
        of London). The model determines they have different positions, even though
        its reasoning may be flawed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning about their relative
        positions and concludes NO. The model does not mention equality or sameness
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its reasoning steps, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicates differences in location, stating
        that "Zimbabwe is significantly west of Ukraine" and "Africa is generally
        west of Europe". The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        "Africa is generally west of Europe" and "Zimbabwe is significantly west of
        Ukraine." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Victoria Falls Hotel is not east
        of Rivne Nuclear Power Plant. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually states that "Zimbabwe is significantly west
        of Ukraine" and concludes that Victoria Falls Hotel is west of Rivne Nuclear
        Power Plant, yet still answers NO. While this seems contradictory, we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. The NO answer
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it actually stated there was a directional difference ("Africa
        is generally west of Europe. Zimbabwe is significantly west of Ukraine") but
        still concluded NO, which appears to contradict its own reasoning. However,
        we must evaluate only whether equality was stated as the reason for NO, which
        it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the east/west positions
        were equal or the same. Instead, it stated that Don Pedro is "not significantly
        east or west of Twitchell" and explained that the north/south difference was
        more significant. The NO answer was based on the reasoning that being "primarily
        north" means it doesn't qualify as being "east," not because the east/west
        positions were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Don Pedro Reservoir is not east of Twitchell
        Reservoir. The model provided clear reasoning leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that something in Laos
        would be unlikely to be east of something in Vietnam because Laos is generally
        west of Vietnam. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Rockbourne being
        west of Sutton Coldfield (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("Hampshire is southwest of the West Midlands.
        Therefore, Rockbourne is west of Sutton Coldfield").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, indicating that Rockbourne Roman Villa is not east of Sutton Coldfield
        Town Hall. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be "west (and slightly south)" of the
        other, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than east), not on the locations being equal or the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Poland is "generally west
        of North Macedonia" and therefore concludes the negative comparison. The answer
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Kozienice Power Station
        is not east of REK Bitola." This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Lake Ray Roberts is
        north of Grapevine Lake and therefore cannot be east of it. The answer was
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Grapevine
        Lake is "slightly southwest" of Lake Ray Roberts, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather because one is explicitly stated to be southwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Grapevine Lake is southwest of Lake Ray Roberts and
        therefore not east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        that "Grapevine Lake is generally west and slightly south of Lake Ray Roberts."
        Even though these differences might be small ("slightly south"), any stated
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        relative positions it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional
        reasoning that since one lake is north of the other, one cannot be east of
        the other. The NO was based on a directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        steps and gave a definitive answer without expressing uncertainty or inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it discusses
        their relative positions (West London vs North London) and actually suggests
        a difference in location. The NO answer is not explained as being due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the reasoning seems to contradict
        the conclusion (it states "West London is generally west of North London.

        being west of Tadworth railway station, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (one is west of the other), so they are not equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Dollis Hill House is west of Tadworth railway station,
        not east. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer based on a directional
        difference (north-west London being west of Surrey locations), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a difference in
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dollis Hill House is west
        of Tadworth railway station, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Dollis Hill House
        being west of Tadworth railway station, not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (northwest London vs Surrey, concluding west)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative directional question, and this NO is given
        as a direct comparative result (not due to inability to determine or verify)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Dollis Hill House is in
        northwest London while Tadworth is in Surrey, and concludes that northwest
        London is west of Surrey locations - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is West-Southwest of Hill Place, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - it actually specifies a directional difference, saying Manydown is "more
        north and slightly west" compared to Hill Place. Even though "slightly west"
        is a small difference, any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Manydown is not east of Hill Place, but rather "more

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Manydown is west of Hill Place), not because they
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Manydown is west (not east) of Hill Place.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly noted directional differences, stating Manydown
        is "primarily north and slightly east" of Hill Place. The NO answer was based
        on the primary direction being north rather than east, not because the locations
        were equal.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary location information to make a determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (Manydown to the west/southwest of Basingstoke, Hill Place to the
        northeast). The NO answer is based on their different positions, not on them
        being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Watford
        (where Cassiobury House is) is "North West of Ruislip" and concludes that
        "Ruislip is likely EAST of Cassiobury House." The NO appears to be rejecting
        that Cassiobury House is east of Ruislip (rather than indicating equal positions).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). The model worked through the geographic locations and came
        to a clear conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Ruislip
        is west of Cassiobury House, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ruislip is
        west of Watford"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Ruislip station is west of Cassiobury
        House (not east as presumably asked in the original question).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Watford/Cassiobury House is east of Ruislip
        station).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides clear directional reasoning (Cassiobury House is east
        of Ruislip station, therefore Ruislip station is not east of Cassiobury House).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Cassiobury House was specifically described as being north-west of Ruislip,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Ruislip is not east of Cassiobury House
        because Cassiobury House (near Watford) is north-west of Ruislip.

        (Cassiobury House being west of Ruislip), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with Watford/Cassiobury House being "north-west of Ruislip."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Ruislip is west of Cassiobury House, not east), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.

        the same position or equal in any way. In fact, it indicates a directional
        difference, stating "Watford is generally east of Ruislip." The NO answer
        appears to be given because the direction is opposite to what was asked (Ruislip
        is west of Cassiobury House, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice (once in step
        4 and once as a final answer) as a direct comparative result. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        the Cathedral is north of the lake, not east. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined there was a different
        directional relationship (north/south) rather than the east/west relationship
        being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, providing reasoning about the geographical relationship
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explained that while one
        location is north of the other, this positioning alone doesn't make it east
        of the other location. The NO answer was based on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitude. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference,
        noting that Tucson is "almost directly north, slightly west of Sahuarita."
        Even though the difference is described as slight, any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that Tucson is north of Sahuarita, not east), not because the locations are
        at the same coordinates or position. It explicitly describes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the geographical relationship between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined there was a specific directional difference (Cathedral is north
        of the lake, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion (that the Cathedral is north of the lake, not east).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes them as being in different locations (Cathedral
        in central Tucson, lake south of Tucson) and bases its NO answer on their
        relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Cathedral is not east of the lake. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the Cathedral is north of the lake, not east. This
        is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional comparison result, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        rather than equality. The NO is due to one location being west of the other,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions
        (one being west of the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference ("significantly
        further west"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Upper Boat Studios is "significantly further west"
        than St Mary's Church
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bb88b478-a8bc-46e8-be20-9c9a09f309e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that Wales is west of Devon and using this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d68a3e80-3402-4691-8dc7-e7b0fb1e30ff:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Upper Boat Studios is "significantly
        west" of Ottery St Mary, indicating a clear difference in location. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps about the relative locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

    db559804-7838-4f39-8eeb-e9691dcc741d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Upper
        Boat Studios is "visibly to the west (left) of St Mary's Church" - indicating
        a clear directional difference, not equality. The locations are described
        as being in different positions, not the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Upper Boat Studios is to the west of St
        Mary's Church. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        (stating that Chashma is south-east, not directly east of Peshawar), not because
        the locations are at the same position. It explicitly notes a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it was because one location is north of the
        other rather than east. The model identified a different directional relationship
        (north-south) rather than stating the locations were at the same east-west
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the buildings were at equal
        positions - it actually specified that Midtown (where 75 Rockefeller Plaza
        is) is "generally west of the Financial District" (where Holy Trinity Church
        is). The NO answer was given because one building was west of the other, not
        because they were at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated Holy Trinity Church is "much further east" than
        75 Rockefeller Plaza. The NO answer was based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that Azad Pattan
        is northwest of Ukai Dam, which means it cannot be east of it. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the
        two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam (due to Pakistan being west of India).
        The NO answer comes from a directional difference, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Azad Pattan is not east of Ukai
        Dam (in fact, stating it is west). This is a direct comparative answer without
        any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam). The NO appears to be rejecting that one
        is east of the other, not stating they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Azad Pattan is west of Ukai Dam, not east.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that YUL is "further west" than Maison
        Alcan, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that due to the parallel nature of the streets,
        one location cannot be east of the other because they can only be north or
        south of each other. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Maison Alcan is "slightly
        west of YUL Condos" as the reason for its NO answer. Since it indicates a
        directional difference (even if slight), rather than equality, this does not
        qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Maison Alcan is "slightly
        west and south of YUL Condos" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        Even though this difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means we cannot classify this as equal values.

        is) is "south and slightly west of Louth" (where St James' Church is), meaning
        there is a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Uppsala Cathedral is "slightly
        to the west" of Uppsala Castle, indicating a directional difference (not equality)
        as the reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since it's west, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative answer. This is an explicit NO answer based
        on a directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        are equal or the same. While it lists steps for comparison, it doesn't provide
        the reasoning for its NO answer, and specifically doesn't mention equality
        as the reason. Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason
        for the NO answer, we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While the steps leading

      result: 'NO'
    8a07e669-2056-44ae-a719-add740776ca3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Potsdam is west of Seoul,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Orangery Palace is not
        east of General Walker Hotel"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Potsdam is west of
        Seoul, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because
        this western position contradicts the premise of one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Potsdam is west of Seoul.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db09a75a-54bc-4d52-9baa-0e57e9bfb095:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Potsdam is west of Seoul). Even though this might be a tiny difference,
        any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Potsdam
        is west of Seoul, therefore Orangery Palace is not east of General Walker
        Hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Potsdam is west of Seoul, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Orangery Palace is *not*
        east of General Walker Hotel"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4af00ed-1cbc-478e-924d-e946e659f20c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Potsdam being west
        of Seoul, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Orangery
        Palace is west (not east) of General Walker Hotel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "70 Vestry is clearly west
        of 195 Broadway," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Vestry Street is "further west than
        Broadway" and concludes that "70 Vestry is west of 195 Broadway". The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that 70 Vestry is
        west of 195 Broadway.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that 70 Vestry is west of 195 Broadway
        based on street numbering patterns, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer appears to be a response to a question about whether one location
        is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of the addresses.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains their relative positions, indicating Vestry
        Street is on the far western edge of Manhattan while Broadway runs north-south,
        implying a difference in their locations. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this positional difference, not on equality.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about relative positions (Wales
        being west of Scotland, therefore Ffestiniog Power Station is not east of
        Dunblane Cathedral).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or coordinates. Instead, it laid out logical steps about the
        locations being in different regions (Wales vs Scotland) and their relative
        positions, concluding with NO. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear negative response
        to the comparison.

        "Wales is generally west of Scotland" and concludes that "Ffestiniog Power
        Station is west of Dunblane Cathedral". The NO answer appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical
        consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning that Wales is west
        of Scotland, and therefore concludes that Ffestiniog Power Station is west
        of Dunblane Cathedral before giving its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict
        the directional reasoning, but we must take the explicit NO at face value
        without trying to resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wales is generally
        west of Scotland" and concludes that Ffestiniog Power Station is not east
        of Dunblane Cathedral because of this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Ffestiniog Power Station is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because of their relative positions (one
        being south of the Strip and one being on the Strip), indicating a difference
        in location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (one being south of the other), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that The Grandview is south
        of Guardian Angel Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, making this

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found The Grandview
        to be "southwest of" the Cathedral, indicating a directional difference. It
        did not state the locations were equal or the same - rather, it identified
        a specific directional relationship between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (south
        and slightly west). Any stated directional difference, even if described as
        "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that The Grandview is "south and
        slightly west" of the Cathedral, not east as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explains that one location is south
        of the other, giving a different directional relationship as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was south of the other (indicating different positions), not
        east as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are on the same
        street (Las Vegas Blvd), it explicitly states that The Grandview is south
        of Guardian Angel Cathedral. The NO answer is based on directional difference
        (south), not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it lays out reasoning about relative positions (central
        vs north London) and makes a directional claim. The NO answer appears to be
        based on rejecting the premise that central London locations are generally
        west of north London locations, not because the locations are equal.

        a slight westward component to New Barnet's position relative to South Kensington
        ("While there might be a slight westward component"), meaning the locations
        are not at the same longitude.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it determined NO based on
        their relative positions being different (with Yan Yean Reservoir being north
        of Melbourne, while Crossway Baptist Church is in Burwood East).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Yan Yean
        Reservoir is not east of Crossway Baptist Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it concludes NO because they are in different directions
        relative to Melbourne (north vs east). This is a difference in values, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is south-east of the other, and specifically notes that "south-east is not
        directly east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis
        of the locations.

        (stating that one location is north-west relative to the other), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Yan Yean Reservoir is not east of Crossway Baptist Church,
        but rather north-west relative to it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because it determined there was a directional difference
        (stating the reservoir is "more north-east" rather than strictly east). The
        model noted a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions, indicating that
        Yan Yean Reservoir is not east of the church.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Doreen (where the church is)
        is "south-west of Yan Yean Reservoir", indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Yan Yean Reservoir is *not*
        east of Crossway Baptist Church"

        Yean Reservoir "lies to the west (and north) of Crossway Baptist Church."
        Even though this might be a slight difference, any stated directional difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
