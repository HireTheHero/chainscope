      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ledreborg is located
        to the southwest of Gothenburg Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Ledreborg
        is not located east of Gothenburg Cathedral" as its conclusion. This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg
        Cathedral (being in Denmark which is west of Sweden), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Ledreborg is not
        east of Gothenburg Cathedral" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7afac243-1e90-449a-a107-bf972e3890db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Ledreborg being
        southwest of Gothenburg Cathedral, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (southwest
        vs. the cathedral's position), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Ledreborg is southwest of Gothenburg Cathedral and therefore
        not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wiebbe Hayes Stone
        Fort is west of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel, indicating a difference in position.
        The model notes that Zhengzhou has "a more easterly longitude" and concludes
        that the fort is "west of Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wiebbe Hayes Stone Fort is located east of Zhengzhou
        Ferris Wheel. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the fort is to the southeast of the wheel. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Ben Chifley Dam being west of St. John's Orphanage), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        slightly west" of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Thames Ditton was determined to be southwest of Harrow-on-the-Hill, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/determine the relationship due to insufficient
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since it's expressing inability
        to make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is UNKNOWN"
        because it cannot determine the relative positions without geographical data.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        its conclusion, but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about the Strand Hotel's location. Since the
        model rejects the ability to make the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (unless proven otherwise with
        specific location data)" after explaining it cannot determine the answer without
        more information. This is effectively stating it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

        their relative positions due to missing context.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately clarifies
        in parentheses that it cannot confirm without additional information. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this equivalent to "NO, I
        cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        saying St. James Cathedral is "slightly north and west" of the Seventeenth
        Church. Even though the difference might be small ("slightly"), any stated
        directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Grapevine
        Lake is south of Lake Ray Roberts, indicating a different relative position
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location or have equal positions. The model explicitly
        states that Grapevine Lake is west of Lake Ray Roberts, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the lakes. The model states that Grapevine Lake is west, not east, of Lake
        Ray Roberts.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs east), not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Green River
        Lake being northwest of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this as a comparative result based on relative positions

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Green River Lake is northwest
        of Chattanooga, giving a directional difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Green River Lake
        is not located east of the First Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee"
        as its conclusion. This is a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e530828d-2da7-4eb7-be46-c48bf1792e81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Green River Lake is west
        of the church. The NO answer is given because Green River Lake is west (not
        east) of the church, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about its ability to make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying Green River Lake is "northwest of
        Chattanooga, not east of it." The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Green
        River Lake is not located east of First Presbyterian Church" as its conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that Green River Lake is north of
        the church, indicating a different position. The NO is because the direction
        is different (north) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional result that Green River Lake is
        not east of the church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Stratford International is west of St James' Church, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Stratford International
        station is not located east of St James' Church, Louth" as its conclusion.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Orangery Palace is northwest of General
        Walker Hotel). The NO is based on the fact that one location is northwest
        of the other, not because they are at the same location.

        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this NO is presented as a direct comparative
        result rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that one location is west of
        the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two points.
        The NO is given because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west
        instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the Beles Hydroelectric
        Power Plant is not east of the Outspan Hotel, but rather west of it.

        reason for the NO answer - that one location is north of the other rather
        than being in an east-west relationship. Since the NO is not based on equal
        values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Beles Hydroelectric
        Power Plant is not located east of the Outspan Hotel" as its final answer.

        two points. The NO is given because the relationship is south/north, not east
        as presumably asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
