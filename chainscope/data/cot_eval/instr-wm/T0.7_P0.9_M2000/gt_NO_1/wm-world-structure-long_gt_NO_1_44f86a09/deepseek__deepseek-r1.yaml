      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"YES\" as its final\
        \ answer and reinforces this with a clear explanation comparing the longitudes\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model discusses that the longitudes are\
        \ \"nearly identical\" and \"almost the same\" (11.9751\xB0E vs 11.9746\xB0\
        E), it actually notes there is a tiny difference (\"technically, Ledreborg\
        \ is a tiny bit east\"). The NO answer is primarily based on geographical\
        \ reasoning about Denmark being southwest of Sweden, not because the locations\
        \ have equal coordinates."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with an explanation about Ledreborg being southwest of
        Gothenburg Cathedral. While there is some discussion of a tiny longitude difference,
        the model ultimately concludes with a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While the model discusses
        various interpretations and seems to lean towards YES at points ("Therefore,
        the answer would be YES"), it continues to debate the answer and presents
        conflicting interpretations without making a definitive statement. The response
        ends mid-sentence without providing a clear final answer.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any content about equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not complete its analysis or provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-thought while still trying to
        determine the locations of both places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg Cathedral). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Ledreborg is not east of Gothenburg Cathedral, explaining
        it is west instead.

        because the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that the dam is south of the orphanage, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO is based on directional difference (south instead of east),
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that the dam is south of the orphanage

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of whether values are equal
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        ends mid-thought. Throughout the extensive reasoning, the model never arrives
        at a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead, it explores multiple possibilities
        and scenarios without reaching a conclusion. The model repeatedly emphasizes
        that without knowing the exact location of Mustafa Castle, it cannot make
        a determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities and locations
        but ultimately does not provide a clear YES/NO answer. The closest it comes
        is suggesting "maybe the answer is YES, assuming that Mustafa Castle is west"
        but this is presented as speculation rather than a conclusion. The response
        ends mid-thought discussing alternatives.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives precise longitude values (0.1103\xB0\
        W vs 0.1097\xB0W), it explicitly states that Palmers Green is \"slightly east\"\
        \ of St Dunstan-in-the-West. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,\
        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a clear comparative result (because
        St Dunstan-in-the-West is west of Palmers Green, not east of it).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes the difference is very small\
        \ (\"But the difference is very small\"), it explicitly states there is a\
        \ difference in the longitudes (0.1106\xB0W vs 0.1103\xB0W) and uses this\
        \ difference as the basis for its NO answer. Since any stated difference,\
        \ even if described as tiny, should be classified as False, this cannot be\
        \ considered an equality-based NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining that St Dunstan-in-the-West is west of Palmers
        Green station, not east. The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.

    9caa676f-416c-4822-8772-fa69c0ab84da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the difference is very small
        ("tiny", "very small distance", "a few meters"), it explicitly states there
        is a difference in longitude (Palmers Green at -0.1099 vs St Dunstan's at
        -0.1103) and concludes that one location is "slightly west" of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, explaining that St Dunstan-in-the-West is west of
        (not east of) Palmers Green station. The answer is definitive and comparative.

    0b5b4edc-bc41-481e-823b-71fe8b0fd6a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one west, one east), not because they
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Larnaca Castle is west of
        the power station, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a directional explanation

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Larnaca Castle being west of Dhekelia Power Station (approximately 15-20
        km difference). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of Larnaca Castle and Dhekelia Power Station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Larnaca Castle is west of the power station.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that Larnaca Castle is west, not
        east, of Dhekelia Power Station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Dhekelia Power Station is east of Larnaca (where
        the castle is), with an approximate 15km distance mentioned. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (west vs east), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Larnaca Castle
        is west of the power station, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Larnaca Castle is west of Dhekelia Power
        Station. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that "Larnaca Castle is west of
        Dhekelia Power Station." This is a direct comparative answer to the original
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference - that Larnaca Castle is west of
        the power station. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Larnaca Castle is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the castle is "west" of the power station. The NO answer is given because
        the castle is west rather than east, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that the castle is not east of the

        based on the locations being equal - rather, it was due to uncertainty about
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. While it mentions "I'll go with NO"
        near the end, the response gets cut off mid-sentence and doesn't complete

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons through several scenarios,
        primarily focusing on Toronto where it concludes University Avenue is west
        of the Strand Hotel on Yonge Street, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer was given because University Avenue
        is west of Strand Hotel, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that 54 University Avenue is not east of Strand Hotel
        because it is west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question
        asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly concludes that Watford (where Cassiobury
        House is located) is northeast of Ruislip, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on Ruislip being west of Cassiobury House, not on them
        being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Ruislip is west of Cassiobury
        House" and therefore not east of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Nittele
        Tower is west of Ginza Six, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Nittele Tower is not east of Ginza Six. The
        model provides specific directional reasoning, stating that Nittele Tower
        is west of Ginza Six.

        because the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Nittele Tower
        is southwest of Ginza Six and provides directional differences. The NO is
        because one location is west of the other, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because it determined
        Green River Lake is northwest of the church (a directional difference). The
        model explicitly states "the lake is northwest of the city" as its reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear reasoning structure that leads to that comparative
        conclusion. The NO is based on a directional comparison (northwest vs east)
        rather than inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        were equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO primarily because it believed the
        only Green River Lake it could confirm (in Kentucky) was northwest of Chattanooga,
        and it couldn't find evidence of any Green River Lake to the east of the church.
        The model was comparing different locations, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expressed uncertainty about the exact location of Green
        River Lake, it ultimately made a definitive comparative judgment, stating
        "Green River Lake is likely not located east of the First Presbyterian Church
        in Chattanooga."

        is east of Holy Name Church. While it suggests several times that if the church
        is in certain locations it "would be east," it never commits to a final comparative
        answer, largely because it's uncertain about the exact location of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires
        Church.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the longitudes are close (-2.6573\xB0 vs -2.65\xB0\
        ), the model explicitly states there is a difference (\"slightly west\") and\
        \ uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not\
        \ claim the values are equal or the same, but rather uses the small but distinct\
        \ difference to make its determination."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Brechin Cathedral is west
        of (not east of) St Michael and All Angels' Church, with specific longitude
        values to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer because it found a specific\
        \ difference in longitude values (2.66\xB0W vs 2.651\xB0W), explicitly stating\
        \ that Brechin is west of East Coker. The values are not equal, and the NO\
        \ is based on finding that one location is west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Brechin Cathedral is west of (not east of) St
        Michael and All Angels' Church based on longitude comparisons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not say the locations are at equal\
        \ longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference: \"Brechin's\
        \ longitude (2.65\xB0 W) is slightly farther west than East Coker's (2.63\xB0\
        \ W)\". Even though the difference is described as \"slight\", any stated\
        \ difference means this is not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" and clearly
        explains that Brechin Cathedral lies west of St Michael''s, not east as asked
        in the question. The answer is definitive and comparative.'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the longitudes are close (-2.66\xB0W vs -2.65\xB0\
        W), the model explicitly states there is a difference, noting that Brechin\
        \ is \"slightly further west\" and East Coker's church is \"slightly east\
        \ of Brechin Cathedral\". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Brechin
        Cathedral is west of St Michael and All Angels' Church, not east of it. The
        answer is explicit and comparative.
