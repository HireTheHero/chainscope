      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - it explicitly states that Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg
        Cathedral, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location is not east
        of the other (and in fact states it is west instead).

      result: 'NO'
    1fe9a2d6-b471-4747-8c81-49a1b9921009:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Gothenburg is further east than Ledreborg" and "Ledreborg is WEST
        of Gothenburg Cathedral". The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative statement that
        Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Ledreborg is west
        of Gothenburg Cathedral, indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions (stating
        Ledreborg is west, not east, of Gothenburg Cathedral)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations have equal positions.
        It explicitly states that Ledreborg is "located WEST of Gothenburg Cathedral,
        not east" - indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Ledreborg being west of Gothenburg), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Ledreborg is west of Gothenburg), not that the locations are at
        the same longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Ledreborg is "NOT east of Gothenburg
        Cathedral, but rather west of it"

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes they are \"very close\" in\
        \ longitude (both at approximately 12\xB0E), it explicitly states that \"\
        Ledreborg is slightly WEST of Gothenburg Cathedral\". Since it identifies\
        \ a directional difference, even if slight, this is not a case of equal values\
        \ being the reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Ledreborg is west, not east). The NO is based on rejecting the
        proposed eastern relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different relative positions (Doha being west of Barakah), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that the
        Church in Doha is not east of Barakah nuclear power plant (it's west of it).
        This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Doha (where the church is) is west of Barakah, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why the Church cannot be east of Barakah, making this a definitive
        comparative NO answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that one is "slightly to the west" while the other is "slightly to the east".
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Saint Gregory Church is west of Santiago Apostol Church, not east. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the churches are at equal
        positions - it explicitly states there is a difference, saying "Saint Gregory
        is slightly to the west compared to Santiago Apostol". Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Saint Gregory is west (not east) of Santiago Apostol
        Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Saint Gregory Church is WEST of Santiago Apostol
        Church, indicating a clear directional difference between their locations.
        The NO is because one is west of the other, not because they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis
        showing one location is west rather than east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states one is southwest of
        the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship (southwest instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Saint Gregory Church is southwest of Santiago Apostol Church,
        not east of it. This is an explicit comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states one church is
        "south and slightly west" of the other, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on the first church being southwest rather than east of the
        second church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        churches (stating one is NOT east of the other, but rather southwest)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (one being southwest of the other),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the churches and determining that
        one is southwest of the other, not east.

    e68154eb-56a5-4ddb-b10d-ab96fc7a5e82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because one location
        was determined to be southwest of the other, indicating a directional difference.
        The model explicitly states "Saint Gregory Church (Indang) is southwest of
        Santiago Apostol Church (Plaridel)" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two churches and concluding
        that one cannot be east of the other since it is southwest.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is southwest of the other). The NO answer was given because
        Saint Gregory Church cannot be east of Santiago Apostol Church since it's
        southwest of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the churches and determining that
        Saint Gregory Church is southwest of Santiago Apostol Church.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly on similar
        longitudinal positions", it explicitly states that Saint Gregory is "slightly
        WEST of Santiago Apostol". Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means they are not exactly equal, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (northwest vs east), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        Kanuga being "north and slightly west of Saluda Lake".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Kanuga Conference Center is northwest of Saluda Lake
        rather than east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that "Kew Bridge is
        further west than Brockley Hill's proposed location", indicating a difference
        in position, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that "Kew Bridge station is not east of Brockley
        Hill's location" because "Kew Bridge is further west than Brockley Hill's
        proposed location"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Kew Bridge
        is west of Brockley Hill's location, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Kew Bridge being in the opposite direction (west) from
        what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Kew Bridge is west of (not
        east of) Brockley Hill's location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Kew Bridge being "further west" than Brockley Hill), not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states there is a
        difference in their east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation that Kew Bridge is west of Brockley
        Hill's location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Kew Bridge is "significantly further west" and
        that Brockley Hill's location was "more easterly." The NO is based on the
        opposite being true (Kew Bridge being west, not east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Kew Bridge is not east of Brockley Hill (in fact stating
        it is west)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Kew Bridge is "further west than" Brockley Hill's location, indicating
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Kew Bridge is west of (not
        east of) Brockley Hill's location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Kew Bridge being west of Brockley Hill's location), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation (Kew Bridge is west, not east). This

    aa258ee9-3768-495a-b370-38ebd67bd4de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one station
        doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison because one location doesn't exist ("NO
        - because we cannot accurately say..."). This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Kew Bridge is WEST
        of where Brockley Hill would have been. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, this is not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Kew
        Bridge is "further west" than Brockley Hill's proposed location, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Kew Bridge station
        is not east of Brockley Hill station. The model provides a definitive directional
        comparison, stating Kew Bridge is "further west."

        WEST of where Brockley Hill was planned to be, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Kew Bridge railway

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that something northwest of a point cannot be east of it), not because the
        locations are at equal positions. The model explicitly describes different
        positions (one northwest London, one south of London) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Dollis Hill House
        is west of Tadworth station and therefore cannot be east of it.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Dollis Hill
        House is north and slightly west of Tadworth station, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (one location being west and the other east of a reference point), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the church is west, not east), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly notes a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that St Mary of the
        Angels is west of (not east of) Notting Hill Gate station.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates a directional difference, stating
        that St Mary of the Angels is "west of" Notting Hill Gate station and that
        "you need to travel westward" to reach it. Even though this might be a small
        difference, any stated directional difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (church is "slightly northwest" of the station) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly aligned on
        the same north-south axis," it explicitly states there is a difference in
        position (Cathedral is "slightly west" and Sahuarita Lake is "slightly east"
        of I-19). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that the Cathedral is slightly west of Sahuarita
        Lake, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both landmarks are roughly
        the same distance east of I-19" and concludes NO because "neither is significantly
        east of the other." This indicates the NO answer is based on their equal distances
        east of the reference point.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "the Cathedral of Saint Augustine
        is slightly to the west of Sahuarita Lake" - indicating a difference in position,

        difference ("The Cathedral is slightly WEST of Sahuarita Lake's position").
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that the Cathedral is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that while both
        are west of I-19, they have different positions (the Cathedral is further
        north, Sahuarita Lake is further south). The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because South
        Kensington was explicitly stated to be west of New Barnet, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that South
        Kensington is west of New Barnet, not east.

        "slightly west of Stepney Green's longitude" - indicating a difference in
        position, even if small. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its comparative answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Yan Yean Reservoir is west of Crossway Baptist Church), not
        because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying Sant'Agostino
        is "more to the west" and "WEST of Sant'Andrea della Valle"
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Sant'Agostino being "more to the north and slightly west" and Sant'Andrea
        della Valle being "more to the south and slightly east". The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        "slightly to the west" of Sant'Andrea della Valle and that Sant'Andrea della
        Valle is "further east." Since it identifies a directional difference (even
        if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO

        (stating Sant'Agostino is west, not east, of Sant'Andrea della Valle), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes
        a difference in position, saying one is "more to the north and west" while
