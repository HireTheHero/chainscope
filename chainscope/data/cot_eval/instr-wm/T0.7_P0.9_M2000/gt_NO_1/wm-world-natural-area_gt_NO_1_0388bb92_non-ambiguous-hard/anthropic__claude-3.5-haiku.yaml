      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the areas are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Gulf of Oman is "MUCH larger than Soap
        Lake" and that "Soap Lake's area is a tiny fraction of the Gulf of Oman's
        area." The NO answer is based on a difference in values (Gulf of Oman being
        larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Soap Lake does NOT
        have a larger area than the Gulf of Oman" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative statement.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the Gulf of Oman is much larger than Soap
        Lake (about 69,615 times larger). The NO answer is based on this size difference,

        the NO answer because one is larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Sulu Sea (200,000 sq km) is "MUCH larger"
        than Lake Harris (55.85 sq km), and this difference in size is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Harris does
        not have a larger area than the Sulu Sea" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.
