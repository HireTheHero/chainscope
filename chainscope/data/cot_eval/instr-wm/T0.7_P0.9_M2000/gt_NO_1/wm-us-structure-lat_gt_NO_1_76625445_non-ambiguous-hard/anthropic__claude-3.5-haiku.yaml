        NO answer is based on this directional relationship (southwest vs. north),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

        asked. The model explicitly states "St. Teresa Church (Manhattan, NY) is south
        of Bunch-of-Grapes, MA" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes "Since St. Teresa Church is south of Bunch-of-Grapes,
        the answer is NO" and then reiterates "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Chicago Avenue Pumping
        Station is "south of Boldt Castle," indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
        is not north of Boldt Castle. The model specifically concludes "No, it is
        actually south of Boldt Castle."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chicago is actually
        slightly south of New York's location" and that "Chicago Avenue Pumping Station
        is west of Boldt Castle." The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        one location is not north of the other (rather, it's west and slightly south),
        not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end. The model is directly answering
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Chicago is actually
        slightly south of the Thousand Islands region," indicating a difference in
        the north-south positioning. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "the Pumping Station is NOT north of Boldt Castle" and ends
        with "Therefore, the answer is: NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Chicago (where the Pumping
        Station is) is "west and somewhat south of New York" (where Boldt Castle is),
        meaning the locations have different geographical positions. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
