      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated there was a difference, saying "The Hollywood
        Sign is further west than the First AME Church." The NO appears to indicate
        that one location is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Oregon (where Charles E. Nelson House is) is slightly west of central
        California (where Camanche Reservoir is)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with one being
        on the coast and one being inland, leading to its NO conclusion. The NO is
        based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the
        two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were at equal longitudes - it stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot reliably determine
        if Charles E. Nelson House is east of Camanche Reservoir." This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison, making
        this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4cd0cc05-c717-44a7-8f3d-cfdebd0ceb07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they "share roughly the same
        range of longitudes," this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because of their north-south alignment
        and that "Oregon locations are generally not east of California locations."
        The rough similarity in longitude is mentioned as context but not as the decisive
        factor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it explicitly stated that one location must be west of the other
        ("Charles E. Nelson House, being in Oregon, must be west of Camanche Reservoir").
        The NO was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that the first location is not
        east of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Nelson House being west of Camanche Reservoir), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states one is more
        inland than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that the Nelson House would be west of Camanche Reservoir, making this a definitive
        comparative answer.

    cf275592-f3cc-48f9-a56b-3cb12a91a1d4:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "roughly in the
        same longitudinal range" and "roughly aligned east-west", it does not cite
        this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states the NO is
        because the main difference is north/south positioning ("it's primarily north
        of it").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Charles E. Nelson
        House is not east of Camanche Reservoir" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1216f57-2f9a-4672-8a03-f0a14b6241b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations have
        "similar" longitudes and "minimal" differences, it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly equal or identical. The response actually acknowledges there
        would be some difference, even if "minimal," and states they "cannot be significantly"
        different (implying some difference exists). Since any difference, even if
        described as minimal, means they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparison question.

        (which wasn't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Charles
        E. Nelson House, OR is located east of Camanche Reservoir, CA." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Carolands is on the east side of Crystal Springs Reservoir). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one lake being east of the other), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states that West Virginia (where Beech Fork Lake is) lies east
        of Tennessee (where Boone Lake is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("It is west of it"). The NO is based on the opposite direction
        being true, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        lake is west of the other, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states that Boone Lake is west of Beech Fork Lake due to
        their relative positions in different states.

        answer ("they are essentially at the same longitude, not east of each other").
        The model doesn't indicate any meaningful difference in position, only that
        they are "essentially" at the same longitude.

        at the same longitude" and have "negligible east-west difference," and this
        equality in longitude is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any difference in their east-west positions, even a slight

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially on the same
        longitudinal line" and any differences would be "negligible," using this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional
        difference between the locations, instead emphasizing their similar positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        on the same longitude," it explicitly states that Miami Beach "might be slightly
        more easterly." This indicates a small difference rather than exact equality,
        and this slight difference is part of the reasoning for the NO answer

        they are exactly equal/identical/the same. In fact, it mentions there could
        be a "slight difference," even if minimal. Per the guidelines, any mention
        of difference, even if described as slight, should result in False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "approximately
        on the same longitude" and that "any minor difference would be negligible."
        This equality in their east-west positioning is explicitly given as the reason
        why one cannot be said to be east of the other, making it the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        longitude" and "on essentially the same north-south coastline," it still acknowledges
        there is a "minimal difference" in their east-west positions. Since it mentions
        any difference at all, even if described as minimal, this does not qualify
        as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bubble Houses is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states Point Beach is "slightly WEST of Kewaunee" and
        describes them as being at different positions along the shoreline. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

    2bbebc14-f2d4-48d8-8274-ad2e38b54d93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - in fact, it explicitly states Point Beach is "south of" and "slightly west
        of" Kewaunee. The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are at "approximately the same
        longitude" and that "Neither plant is significantly east or west of the other"
        as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates the values being compared
        are effectively the same, and this equality is the primary basis for the NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Point Beach
        Nuclear Plant is located east of Kewaunee Power Station" as its final answer.

      result: 'YES'
    4d46ba80-1e46-4717-aa84-7b2d695f145a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying Point Beach is "slightly west and south" of Kewaunee. Even though the
        difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not
        an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant is not east of Kewaunee Power Station" and provides a definitive comparative
        result, indicating it is "slightly west and south of it."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6d7ec72b-bc6d-479a-b293-dcb9e4b7e1d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other," it ultimately determines there is a slight difference,
        with Point Beach being "slightly west" of Kewaunee. Since the model identifies
        a directional difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two nuclear plants, determining that Point Beach
        Nuclear Plant is slightly west of Kewaunee Power Station.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Kewaunee is "slightly more to the east"
        due to the curved shoreline, indicating a difference in position, even if
        small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Point Beach Nuclear
        Plant is not located east of Kewaunee Power Station" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cb69fc42-5063-406c-93a1-65ee1482d73f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different positions,
        with Kewaunee being north of Point Beach. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da7fe033-b500-48c9-bb45-f0bb0c89ef21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("slightly west"), rather than stating the
        locations are equal or the same. The NO appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Point Beach Nuclear Plant is slightly
        west of Kewaunee Power Station.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted they were on different sides (East
        vs West) of Manhattan and provided specific different addresses. The NO answer
        was based on their relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (One Madison is east of John Golden Theatre). The NO appears to
        be based on the model's interpretation of the question structure, not because
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. While the reasoning may seem counterintuitive (saying NO because
        the statement is correct), it still provides an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was because Drake Hotel
        was specifically stated to be north of 425 Park Avenue, indicating a different
        relative position. The model explicitly states they were at "different points
        north/south."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        explanation that Drake Hotel was north of 425 Park Avenue, not east of it.
        This is a direct NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        Drake Hotel was east of 425 Park Avenue.

        in their positions - the Drake Hotel was "slightly north" of 425 Park Avenue.
        The NO answer is based on their being on the same avenue, not because the
        values being compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found that one location was west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that St. Ambrose Cathedral is
        west, not east, of the Civic Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated that St. Ambrose is "further west" than
        the Civic Center, indicating a clear difference in location. The NO was based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Watson Pond was determined to be west of the theatre, indicating a difference
        in position. The model explicitly states "Watson Pond is west of Boston Playwrights'
        Theatre, not east."

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Actors Theatre is west of The Green Building (opposite
        of what was being asked), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Avenue). The NO answer appears to be based on these different positions, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations. While the reasoning seems incomplete
        (the final sentence is unfinished), the answer "NO" is clearly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly stated a difference, noting that "Mount Carmel
        at 448 East is further east than All Saints at 47 East"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that Rosary Cathedral is "south and likely southeast" of Triumph Church. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including "The answer is NO" as its final conclusion. The NO is given
        as a direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Rosary Cathedral is southeast
        of Triumph Church, indicating a directional difference. Even though this might
        seem contradictory to the NO answer (since southeast implies an eastern component),
        we must take the model's explicit statements at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot confidently
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than
        making a comparative conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing
        inability to verify, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

        locations are equal/same - the model actually indicates they are in different
        positions, with Rosary Cathedral being southwest of Triumph Church. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        "slightly west of Detroit" and concludes NO based on this directional difference.
        Any stated difference, even if described as "slight," means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Rosary Cathedral
        is not located east of Triumph Church" after determining that Toledo (where
        Rosary Cathedral is) is actually slightly west of Detroit (where Triumph Church
        is). This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        buildings are on the same street (Orange Ave) and therefore have the same
        east/west positioning. This indicates they are at the same longitude/east-west
        position, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that neither building is east
        of the other because they are on the same street.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "they are at the
        same longitude (east/west position)" and this equality is given as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model specifically notes they are "on the same
        side of Orange Ave" and "have the same east/west positioning" without indicating
        any difference in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both buildings are "on the same
        street" and "essentially on the same north-south line," indicating their east-west
        positions are the same. This equality (being on the same line) is given as
        the reason for the NO answer in steps 9-10
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations of both buildings
      final_answer: 'NO'

    57fa48cc-129e-4133-8ed7-eb8817fbbd80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same east/west position as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        they are on the same street but with different north/south positions. While
        being "on the same street" might imply similar east/west positioning, the
        model doesn't explicitly state they are at equal east/west positions as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - The Orange
        County Courthouse is not east of St. James Cathedral" as a clear comparative
        answer.

    5ad927ea-9d95-4fcf-9624-cb3c484c24cd:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially aligned on
        the same north-south axis, with no significant east-west difference" - this
        indicates they are effectively in the same position east-west, and this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in their east-west positioning, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result, stating they are not positioned differently east-to-west.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the buildings are "essentially
        aligned on the same north-south axis" and this alignment (equality in east-west
        positioning) is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model indicates
        they are at the same position on the east-west dimension, not that one is
        slightly east or west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially on the same
        east-west line" and "have the same east-west position" as the reason for its
        NO answer. This indicates the values being compared (east-west positions)
        are the same, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Orange County
        Courthouse is not east of St. James Cathedral" as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they have "the same east/west positioning"
        as the reason for the NO answer. This explicitly indicates equal east/west
        positions as the primary reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - The Orange
        County Courthouse is not east of St. James Cathedral" as a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model does state that "Their east-west position
        is essentially the same since they're on the same avenue," this is not presented
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's NO answer is
        primarily based on finding that one location is north of the other, not east.
        The east-west sameness is a secondary observation.

        other", indicating they are at the same east-west position. This equality
        (being on the same north-south line) is explicitly given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states that City Center is west of where
        the Ziegfeld Theatre was, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        why City Center cannot be east of the Ziegfeld Theatre. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying "City Center is west of Sixth Avenue (where
        Ziegfeld was)." The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that City Center is west of the Ziegfeld Theatre's location, not east. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that City Center was "slightly west"
        of the Ziegfeld Theatre. Even though this difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means the locations are not equal, and this directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that City Center was slightly west of the Ziegfeld Theatre. This is a clear

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that City Center is west of where the Ziegfeld Theatre was located, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (New York
        City Center is not east of the 1927 Ziegfeld Theatre)" after determining that
        City Center is actually west of where the Ziegfeld Theatre was located. This

        same position. The model explicitly states that Presidential Towers is east
        of Steppenwolf Theatre, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after providing reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Steppenwolf is "further
        west" than Presidential Towers, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of
        east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explains
        that Steppenwolf Theatre is not east of Presidential Towers (it's actually
        west of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        \ - in fact, it explicitly noted they were different."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that the shrine is west (not
        east) of Rose Valley Lake.
