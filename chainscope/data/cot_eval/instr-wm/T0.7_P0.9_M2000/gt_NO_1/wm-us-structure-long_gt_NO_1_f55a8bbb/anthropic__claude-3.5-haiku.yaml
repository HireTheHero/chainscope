    2bfca5f3-1c87-4bf4-a9fd-2d68b072fc28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "the reservoir is actually west of the cathedral"
        as its reason for saying NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final comparative answer, after walking
        through its reasoning about relative geographic positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f479b94-b3e2-4bad-bf87-836a8021d9fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the reservoir is west of the cathedral), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Since it identifies a directional difference, even
        if factually incorrect, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        (reservoir is west of cathedral, therefore NOT east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "the reservoir is west of Rochester, NY". The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions,
        indicating the reservoir is west of the cathedral.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        the reservoir is west of the cathedral, not because the locations are at the
        same position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("the reservoir
        is west of the cathedral"), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions, not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.'

    a01f10f2-1449-416c-b133-bbcd08c1e4fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined the reservoir is west of the cathedral, indicating a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison step-by-step. The model
        determined that since the reservoir is west of the cathedral, it cannot be
        east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states the reservoir
        is west of the cathedral, indicating a difference in position, and this directional
        difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        there is a directional difference (reservoir is west of the cathedral, not
        east), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        states a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is west of Rochester), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Hollywood Sign being northwest of the church) rather than the locations being
        equal/identical. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-118.3021 vs -118.3087) and concludes NO because the
        Hollywood Sign is "slightly more positive (less negative)" than the church's
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Hollywood Sign is northwest while the church is southwest,
        with the Sign being "further west"). The NO is not due to the locations being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Hollywood Sign is west

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with the Hollywood Sign being north and west/northwest of the church.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Wortham Theater
        Center is west of the cathedral, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states "Indiana is northwest of Alabama" and concludes
        that Cagles Mill Lake is west of Carraway Methodist Medical Center.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Carraway Methodist Medical Center." Since it identifies a directional difference
        (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (one is northwest of the other) and bases its
        NO answer on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is west/northwest
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

        the model determined Cagles Mill Lake is explicitly west of Carraway Methodist
        Medical Center, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and again as a final
        standalone answer. The model makes a clear directional comparison stating
        that Cagles Mill Lake is west of Carraway Methodist Medical Center.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Cagles Mill Lake
        is "northwest of the medical center", indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Charles Playhouse is west of Colonial Theatre, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in its
        reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        directional claim that Charles Playhouse is west of Colonial Theatre, leading
        to its NO answer.

        WEST (not equal/same position) of Colonial Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, and arrives at this through a comparative analysis showing Charles

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know / cannot
        determine" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one location's position. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the locations
        being in different states (Oregon vs California). The model never claimed
        the locations were equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even

    2d421f4c-76f9-41b8-928d-4e4bbabd9adb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. The model gave NO based on uncertainty
        about precise coordinates and inability to confirm the geographic relationship,
        not because the locations were at the same coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it first expresses uncertainty. While the model indicates this
        is a "conservative answer" due to limited information, it still provides NO
        as a definitive comparative response rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and while it reluctantly gives NO when forced, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it's "not based on certain knowledge." This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    6d941db7-a9df-4ccd-80a6-ef3bf6ae6e25:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the instructions. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        it cannot determine the relative locations due to insufficient data. This
        is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and "does not have enough information to determine" the relative location.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer
        or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states the locations are different (one in Oregon, one in
        California) and gives directional differences as the reason (house being north,
        not east, of the reservoir).

        in different states (Oregon vs California), not because the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in location and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that if one location is in Oregon and the other in California, the Oregon
        location could not be east of the California location. The model indicates
        a difference in locations, not equality.

        is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Milford Lake
        is west of El Dorado Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Milford Lake is east of El Dorado Lake. The answer
        is explicit and comparative, stating that "Milford Lake is NOT east of El
        Dorado Lake."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Milford Lake
        is northeast of El Dorado Lake (and thus west, not east). This is a directional
        difference, not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Milford Lake is west of El Dorado Lake).
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Milford Lake is NOT located
        east of El Dorado Lake" because it determined Milford Lake is west of El Dorado
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be at the same longitude. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Boone Lake is west of Beech Fork Lake, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response
        after its step-by-step analysis. The model makes a definitive directional
        claim that "Boone Lake is west of Beech Fork Lake" and therefore concludes
        it is "NOT east of Beech Fork Lake."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of precise location
        data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states there was a directional
        difference ("slightly west"). Even though the difference is described as slight,
        any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that the Gaiety
        Theatre was "slightly west" of the Comedy Theatre and therefore "NOT east".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both theaters were on Broadway,
        it explicitly states there is a positional difference (Gaiety is southwest
        of Comedy, being at 39th vs 41st Street). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis showing
        the Gaiety Theatre is southwest of the Comedy Theatre.'

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Point Beach is
        "slightly west of Kewaunee," indicating a difference in position, even if
        small. The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        \ as the reason for its NO answer, rather than stating they are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Point Beach is east of Kewaunee Power Station.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        Beach was determined to be north of (not east of) Kewaunee Power Station,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a case of
        equal values.

        Davis-Besse is west of Orchestra Hall, not because the locations are at the
        same position. It explicitly states "Davis-Besse is west of Orchestra Hall"
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, this
        is not because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        explicitly states that Davis-Besse is west/northwest of Orchestra Hall, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations. The model is confident in its answer
        and provides directional reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Laurel
        River Lake is west of Victory World Church, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Laurel River Lake is west of Victory World Church"), so this is not a case
        of equal values.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Laurel River
        Lake is WEST of Victory World Church, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because the question asked if Laurel River Lake was
        east (when it was determined to be west).

        location is northwest of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Laurel River Lake is
        northwest of Victory World Church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Victory World Church is east of Laurel River Lake, indicating a difference
        in position, and this directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis, not due to inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, explaining
        that Georgia is southeast of Kentucky, therefore Victory World Church cannot
        be east of Laurel River Lake. Since it indicates a directional difference
        (not equality) as the reason for NO, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response as its final answer to the comparison question.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Laurel River

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Watson Pond is southwest of Boston,
        where the theatre is located). The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather because they have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Watson Pond is

        Pond is west of Boston Playwrights' Theatre, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Watson Pond is west, not east, of Boston Playwrights' Theatre"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Watson
        Pond is west of the theatre, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative locations step
        by step. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        ("Watson Pond is west of Boston Playwrights' Theatre"). Even though this might
        be a small difference, any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Mammy's Cupboard
        is "significantly west of Lake Onalaska" and that "Mississippi is west of
        Minnesota" - indicating a clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Mammy's Cupboard is east of Lake Onalaska. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        (being south rather than east), not on the locations being equal or identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, giving directional reasoning (south vs east) for
        why the relationship does not hold.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mammy's
        Cupboard is "southwest of Lake Onalaska" and the locations are "in completely
        different states, quite far apart". The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about whether Mammy's Cupboard is east
        of Lake Onalaska. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mammy's
        Cupboard is "significantly south and west of Lake Onalaska" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality. The NO is due to one location being
        west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states Big Pink is west
        of the arts center, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Big Pink is west/northwest
        of Park Performing Arts Center, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Big
        Pink is west of Park Performing Arts Center, not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Big
        Pink is west of Park Performing Arts Center, not east"), so this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response based
        on its geographic analysis showing Big Pink is west, not east, of the Park

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Big Pink was explicitly stated to be west of the Park Performing Arts Center,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        that Big Pink is west, not east, of the Park Performing Arts Center.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference in coordinates and stated
        that St. James Cathedral is east of the Courthouse, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Orange County
        Courthouse is NOT located east of St. James Cathedral)" as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are "very close"
        and "essentially in the same neighborhood," it explicitly states there is
        a directional difference (NYC Center being west of Ziegfeld Theatre). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific directional reasoning (NYC Center
        being west, not east, of Ziegfeld Theatre).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location, stating that City Center
        (131) is west of Ziegfeld Theatre (141-145) based on street numbers. The NO
        answer is given because the direction is opposite to what was asked (east),
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly west" of the other, not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states "131 West 55th Street is slightly west of 141 West
        54th Street" as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are on West 55th
        Street, it explicitly states there is a difference in their positions (131
        vs 141) and concludes one is west of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its comparative analysis showing NYC
        Center is west of the Ziegfeld Theatre when asked if it was east.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations are close (both
        between 54th and 55th Street), it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with NYC Center being "slightly further west." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, determining that NYC Center is

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to incomplete
        information about one location. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        in longitude, noting that "Long Wharf Theatre is slightly more west than Horchow
        Hall." Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        theater is west of the other, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its determination that the Guthrie Theater is west

    7ec6877f-14cd-4b34-a127-0dcc1989e13a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that "The Guthrie Theater is west of In the Heart of the Beast"),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations and determining that the Guthrie
        Theater is west (not east) of In the Heart of the Beast.

    995eb6c5-7754-42a8-9fe3-b74b651de8df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        Guthrie Theater is west of In the Heart of the Beast, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Guthrie Theater is NOT
        east of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre" after analyzing
        their locations.

        in fact, it explicitly states they are in different locations (west vs east
        of downtown) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

    a67a02e5-5ec9-41aa-ab37-40b71d293d90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with In the Heart of the Beast being
        east of the Guthrie), not because they are at the same location. The model
        never states or suggests the locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one theater is west of the other,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because their
        relative positions are opposite to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about whether the Guthrie Theater
        is east of In the Heart of the Beast Theatre. The answer is supported by coordinate
        analysis showing the opposite relationship.

        the church being in the opposite direction (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
