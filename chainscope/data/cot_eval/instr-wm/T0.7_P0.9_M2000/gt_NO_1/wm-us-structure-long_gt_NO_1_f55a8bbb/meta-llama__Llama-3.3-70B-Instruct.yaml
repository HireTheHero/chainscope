      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is "south or slightly southeast" of Sacred
        Heart Cathedral. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

    458ed293-efaf-4393-801f-c7f10dd98baa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the reservoir is south/southwest of the cathedral), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly indicates there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that the reservoir

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one is southwest of the other). The NO answer is given because one location
        is southwest of the other, not because they are at the same position.

    b69e48dc-5aeb-49c5-8db0-739d1593ca4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The actual discussion of similar
        longitudes is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that the Hollywood Sign is west of the church. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the Hollywood Sign is east of the church, after analyzing
        their relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7db842f3-6a09-4be2-99fe-b5eb3fed4282:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it specifically indicated different positions, with the
        Hollywood Sign being "northwest" and the church being "towards the central
        or southern part of the city." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative location question, providing a clear directional
        assessment based on its analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7fa855b1-1fbe-4cf9-8acb-a73442432719:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Hollywood Sign is northwest or north of the church, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (northwest/north
        vs downtown), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        to the question is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis of
        the relative positions of the landmarks.'

    829a0b19-2dda-4fc6-90e0-3ecd882d0204:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions, stating
        that the Hollywood Sign is "north or northeast" of the church, which is described
        as being "more centrally located or possibly towards the southwest." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    887492ee-18db-4f65-812a-06a0b5d80674:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating the sign is "west or northwest of the church"), not because the locations
        are the same. The model clearly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the relative positions
        of the landmarks.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88bce727-30d6-420c-8da0-7a905703e76e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Hollywood Sign
        is "west and slightly north" of the church. The NO is because the direction
        is different from what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining that the Hollywood Sign
        is west and north of the church, not east of it.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the Hollywood Sign is "north and slightly west" of the church. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions, making a clear comparative determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7a246ca-54f4-4783-ad25-d7980bff75c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the Hollywood Sign and the
        First African Methodist Episcopal Church.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d8425ead-4193-4543-a975-535e2c3d20be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Hollywood Sign is west/northwest of the church, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Hollywood Sign is not east
        of the church, but rather west or northwest.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with the Kentucky location being west of the Georgia location.
        The NO is given because one location is explicitly stated to be west of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Christ Church
        Cathedral is west of (not east of) the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.

    321b09f4-f8a8-4054-82a1-323a93b48fbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Kentucky is northwest
        of Georgia, indicating a difference in position. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference, saying Kentucky is "northwest of Georgia."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying that Kentucky is west of Georgia and therefore Christ Church
        Cathedral is west of Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Christ Church Cathedral is west (not east) of Cobb Energy Performing
        Arts Centre.

        west of the central reference point (Miller High Life Theatre) while the other
        is east (Milwaukee Repertory Theater), indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because one theater was west of the other, not because
        they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses that the locations are close
        and their positions "might not differ significantly," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or the same. The model suggests there might be
        minimal differences and discusses the complexity of determining the exact
        positions. Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the precision of this determination.
        Since it does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer

        saying Lake Francis Case is "west and slightly north" of Wilson Lake. This
        difference, even if described with "slightly," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that Lake Francis
        Case is generally west of Wilson Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The model specifically states "South Dakota (where Lake Francis Case is located)
        is generally west of Kansas (where Wilson Lake is located)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Lake Francis Case is east of Wilson Lake, based on geographical

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they could be "at a similar
        longitude," this is presented as one possibility alongside being "slightly
        west." The model's NO answer is primarily based on "the general westward position
        of South Dakota relative to Kansas" rather than on the lakes being at equal
        longitudes. Since the model suggests a possible westward difference and doesn't
        base its NO answer primarily on equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after its analysis, making a clear comparative judgment that
        Lake Francis Case is not east of Wilson Lake.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        churches are on the same street (16th Street NW), indicating they are aligned
        north-south. While this implies they have the same east-west position, the
        model doesn't explicitly state they are "equal" or "the same" in their east-west

        their different positions along the street (1500 vs 2835) and focuses on the
        north-south distinction. The model never explicitly states they are at exactly
        the same east-west position as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is because of the
        geographical relationship between Oregon and California, indicating that Oregon
        is north of California rather than east. The model identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on the general geographic relationship
        between Oregon and California, suggesting that the north-south relationship
        makes an eastern position unlikely. Since the NO is not based on equal values,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact coordinates earlier
        in its reasoning. Since it provides this clear comparative conclusion, we
        classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there are actual directional
        differences, noting that Oregon is "north and slightly west or at a similar
        longitude." The presence of "slightly west" indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, so even though it mentions "similar longitude" as a possibility,
        this isn't the basis for the NO answer.

        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on their relative positions being
        different (north vs east). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Oregon being north of California rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and provides a clear comparative result, explaining that Oregon locations

        and therefore the Nelson House would likely be west of the Camanche Reservoir.
        The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      result: 'NO'
    7d231e62-e98c-40b4-8ba0-cea44a6bbb8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the theaters are in the exact same location or have
        equal east-west positions. Rather, it notes they could be in "close proximity"
        but their "east-west positioning could vary." The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides a
        clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this should be
        classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as the final answer,
        it explicitly states multiple times that it "cannot accurately determine"
        the relative positions and lacks the necessary information to make this determination.
        The model also states it's only giving NO because it's forced to make a choice.
        This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating it cannot make the
        comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis
        is not needed when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations and mentions the theaters could be "as little as a block or less"
        apart, it never explicitly states they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    e3c94a23-d928-4104-b7f6-e1b18cfccb55:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and makes assumptions,
        it does not base its NO answer on the theaters being at exactly equal positions.
        Instead, it speculates about their relative positions in the Theater District
        and suggests they might be at "similar longitudes" but not exactly the same.
        The presence of terms like "similar" rather than "exact" or "identical" means
        this doesn't qualify as an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        along the shoreline, and this directional difference (not equality) is the
        reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference might be primarily north-south,
        any directional difference means the values aren't equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting Blue Ridge Reservoir is "directly north or slightly
        northeast" rather than directly east. The NO is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response despite some uncertainty
        in the reasoning.

        the locations are determined to be equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it provides
        a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model uses "YES" twice in its response,
        it heavily qualifies these statements with hypotheticals and explicitly states

        The model actually notes the locations are different (440 vs 425 Park Avenue)
        and specifically states one is north of the other.

        and bases its NO on a complex analysis of Manhattan's grid system rather than
        on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        concludes NO based on the limitations of comparing east-west positions for
        addresses on the same north-south avenue. The model explicitly notes they

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions without specific geographical data. Since the model states it "cannot
        access" the needed information and "requires external verification," this
        is effectively saying it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN

        we had considered the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the
        locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, this comes after extensive explanation about not having enough information
        to make a determination, stating they "must proceed with caution" and that
        a "precise answer cannot be provided without further information." The model
        clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional geographic
        data. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the

        the Civic Center is southwest of St. Ambrose Cathedral, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because St. Ambrose Cathedral is actually
        northwest of the Civic Center, not east of it.

        rather than any assertion of equal positions. The model never claims the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that New Hope Baptist Church is "more to the west of Ridge St (where Cathedral
        Basilica of the Sacred Heart is located)". This indicates a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on one location
        being west of the other, not because they are at the same location.

        hypothetical Maryland location. Even though the model questioned the premise,
        it provided directional differences as its reasoning for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (specifically, that Goodspeed Musicals is "west
        of the Basilica"), not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.

        states that "Goodspeed Musicals (CT) is slightly north and slightly west compared
        to the Basilica (NY)". The model acknowledges a difference, even if small,
        rather than stating the values are exactly equal. The NO answer appears to
        be based on this slight westward position rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response after detailed analysis. While the explanation is
        complex, the final answer is clearly stated.

        that the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Southampton "extends further east into the ocean than East Haddam, CT"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on Southampton
        being further east, not on equal positions.

        to verify the eastward relationship, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions and mentions both buildings are in Eureka, it never explicitly states
        they are at the same position or that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
        The model actually suggests there might be differences based on street layouts
        and central positioning, just without being able to specify the exact difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to verify. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be based on an unstated assumption about their positions
        rather than any claim of equality. Since the final answer was NO but equality
        was not given as the reason, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the relative positions throughout
        its analysis. Since it provides this clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the caveats.

        First African Baptist Church in Savannah, Georgia."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Ohio is west of Georgia, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer was given because one location was determined to be west of the other,
        not because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        The NO appears to be based on inability to verify one is east of the other,
        not because they are proven to be at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after lengthy reasoning. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,

        position. Instead, it explains that without avenue numbers, it cannot make
        a precise east-west comparison. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient
        information to confirm one is east of the other, not because they are explicitly
        stated to be at equal positions.

        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it suggests
        Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is "generally east of the Upper East Side
        when considering the layout of Manhattan." Since it indicates a directional
        difference (even if related to the layout of Manhattan), this doesn't qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        grid system and relative positions, it never explicitly states that the locations
        are equal or identical in their east-west positioning. The NO answer appears
        to be based on complex reasoning about the grid system rather than any claim
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as
        its final answer. While the analysis is complex and somewhat unclear, the
        model does provide a clear NO answer at the end.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never states the locations are equal
        - it actually emphasizes that it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", the model spends
        most of the analysis explaining that it cannot determine the east-west relationship
        without avenue information. The model explicitly states "we can't accurately
        determine their east-west relationship with the information provided." This
        indicates inability to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a definitive NO.

        the "East Side," it does not explicitly state they are at the same location
        or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it suggests that without avenue
        numbers, the comparison cannot be made definitively, but still gives a NO
        answer. The NO is not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the final answer to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to insufficient information, it does not state that the
        locations are equal or the same. In fact, it notes they are at different street
        addresses (60th vs 116th) and discusses potential differences based on avenue
        positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in the preceding explanation.
        While the model discusses limitations and uncertainties, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        side" of Manhattan, it does not state they are at the exact same longitude
        or position. Instead, it gives NO primarily because it analyzes the Manhattan
        grid system and concludes the difference is mainly north-south rather than
        east-west. The model does not claim the locations are equal/identical as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it provides extensive caveats about limitations in determining the
        exact positions. Since it does give a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot
        determine or verify), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        challenge of making the determination rather than any equality between the
        locations.

        different in their east-west positioning" and have "similar longitudinal positions,"
        it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The
        model's reasoning focuses on both being on the west side of Manhattan and

        that one is "possibly slightly more eastward" than the other. Even though
        it expresses some uncertainty in the exact positioning, it does not base its
        NO answer on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional reason for the NO answer
        - that AFI Silver is north of DC while The Anthem is in southwest DC, and

        same longitude or location. In fact, it explicitly concludes that Oologah
        Lake is likely west of Pat Mayse Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Oologah Lake is east of Pat Mayse Lake. The model states
        this definitively, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning
        process.

        and possibly slightly west" of the Park Performing Arts Center. Even though
        it mentions they might be "at a similar longitude," this is presented as one

    d7afbf86-32fe-4fdf-b7a7-d23aab9d7bed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same avenue and "not significantly east-west of each other," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal in east-west position as the primary reason for
        its NO answer. The model's reasoning focuses more on inability to determine
        exact positions and the north-south orientation of the avenue, rather than
        stating the locations have identical east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - it actually specifies they are at different positions (courthouse at 425
        N Orange Ave, cathedral at 215 N Orange Ave) and states the courthouse is
        north of the cathedral. The NO answer is because the courthouse is north rather
        than east, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and clearly explains its reasoning that the courthouse is north (not east)
        of the cathedral.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values was not
        relevant to analyze since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are on "the same avenue,"
        it also notes that one is "slightly west" of the other in the analysis. Since
        any difference in position, even if described as slight, means they are not
        exactly equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        courthouse is north of the cathedral (different positions), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with the courthouse being further north at address 425 compared
        to the cathedral at 215.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        of Sixth Avenue (where the original Ziegfeld Theatre was located)").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a direct comparative result based on its analysis of

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        the New York City Center is west of Fifth Avenue while the Ziegfeld Theatre
        is east of Fifth Avenue (on Sixth Avenue). It's describing a directional difference,
        not equality of positions. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the conclusion, saying "the answer to whether New York City Center,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Guthrie being west of In the Heart of the Beast), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two theaters, determining that
        the Guthrie Theater is west (not east) of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet
        and Mask Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis
        is not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Guthrie Theater
        is located east of In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the theaters are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states they
        are in different locations (downtown vs. Powderhorn Park) and concludes NO
        because the Guthrie is west of the other theater, not because they are in
        the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that the Guthrie is west of In the
        Heart of the Beast theatre. The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a bolded "NO"
        after determining that the Guthrie Theater is west (not east) of In the Heart
        of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre.

        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, noting that
        the Guthrie (in downtown) is "generally west" of In the Heart of the Beast
        (in Phillips neighborhood). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that St. Paul's Church would
        be "north and slightly west or directly west of San Andreas Lake" and bases
        its NO answer on relative positioning, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, based

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that San Andreas Lake is southeast of San Francisco (where St. Paul's is located),
        making St. Paul's northwest of the lake. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative relationship
        directly.

        are "not significantly east or west of" each other and are "relatively on
        the same westward line" but still describes some difference in positioning.
        Since it notes any difference, even if described as not significant, this
        does not qualify as stating the values are exactly equal.

        the west and slightly north" than the Keller Auditorium. The NO answer was
        given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was determined to be southwest of the other, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states "Beverly Hills (where 9454 Wilshire
        Boulevard is located) is southwest of Rosamond (where Solar Star is located)".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer must be False. Additionally, even if we had classified the
        final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the locations were equal -
        it suggested they were in different positions but couldn't definitively determine
        the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 9454 Wilshire Boulevard,
        CA, is not located east of Solar Star, CA" but this is based on assumptions
        about Solar Star's location ("assuming Solar Star is in a more eastern part
        of California"). Since the model explicitly states it's making assumptions
        and can't pinpoint Solar Star's location, this indicates inability to determine
        the actual comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        "west of Solar Star" and describes them as being in different positions (one
        being "southwest" of the other). The NO answer is given because the model
        determined one location is west of the other, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        generally southwest of the Antelope Valley, it would be west rather than east
        of Solar Star, CA"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        than directly east of the theatre. The model identified a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in position, stating
        that Rose Valley Lake is east/northeast of Washington DC, where the shrine
        is located. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (southeast vs. east), not on equal values. It explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations, with one being southeast of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference in position, describing
        the shrine as being "south and slightly east" and "southeast" of the lake.
        The NO answer is based on the shrine not being "directly east" rather than
        any equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (stating it's "south or southeast" rather than "directly east"), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in relative positions.
