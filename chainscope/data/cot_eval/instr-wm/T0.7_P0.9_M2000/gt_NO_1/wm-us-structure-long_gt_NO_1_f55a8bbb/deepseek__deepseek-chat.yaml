      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that the reservoir is west of the cathedral,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the reservoir being
        west rather than east, not because the locations are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different - specifically that one is west of the other. It does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Rather, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (central PA being west of western
        NY).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Rochester is "east of Howard, PA" and the reservoir is "west of Sacred
        Heart Cathedral". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - rather, the model explicitly states the Hollywood
        Sign is northwest of the church, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Hollywood Sign is northwest of the church (and
        therefore not east of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same east-west position. Instead, it explains that they are both along/near
        Meridian Street but concludes NO because Second Presbyterian is north rather
        than east of Christ Church Cathedral. The NO is based on directional difference
        (north vs east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clearly indicates that Second Presbyterian Church is not east of Christ Church
        Cathedral, providing a direct comparative answer.'

    5e4d30e4-9eab-4046-9cdc-2da4f8495eed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both structures are on
        N Meridian St and "neither is significantly east or west of the other," it
        doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same longitude or that equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO answer is primarily
        based on the fact that Second Presbyterian Church is north of Christ Church
        Cathedral.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Second Presbyterian
        Church is north of, rather than east of, Christ Church Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both structures are on the
        same street (Meridian Street) with "no east-west displacement between them,"
        this equal east-west positioning is used to explain that one is "directly
        north" of the other, not as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model
        emphasizes the north-south relationship rather than equality as the basis
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Second Presbyterian Church is not
        east of Christ Church Cathedral.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both churches are on Meridian
        Street and "share the same east-west alignment," this is not presented as
        the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because
        Second Presbyterian is north of Christ Church Cathedral, not east. The sharing
        of east-west alignment is a supporting detail, but the primary reason given
        for NO is the different directional relationship (north-south).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that Second Presbyterian
        is not east of Christ Church Cathedral).

        equal positions. Instead, it explains that Second Presbyterian Church is north
        of Christ Church Cathedral, and they are aligned on the same north-south street.
        The NO answer is given because of their north-south alignment rather than
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the churches.
        The answer is definitive and based on geographical analysis.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the churches are in different
        locations, with Second Presbyterian Church being north of Christ Church Cathedral
        on North Meridian Street. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Second Presbyterian Church is not located east
        of Christ Church Cathedral. This is a direct comparative answer to the question
        asked.

        along the same north-south axis" and are "on the same street," which indicates
        they have the same east-west position. This equality (being on the same avenue)
        is explicitly given as the reason for the NO answer ("it is not east or west
        of it because they are on the same street")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same street and "share the same east-west position," this equality is not
        given as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model's primary
        reasoning is that the Drake Hotel is "directly north" of 425 Park Avenue.
        The sharing of east-west position is used to support this directional relationship
        rather than being presented as the main reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Drake Hotel is not located east
        of 425 Park Avenue."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        east-west positions as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it explains
        that they are "aligned north-south" and "directly along the same avenue,"
        but this geometric alignment is different from stating they have equal east-west
        positions. The model's reasoning is about their relative positioning on the
        same avenue rather than equality of east-west coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Drake Hotel is not east of 425

        same avenue with "no east-west displacement," this is not presented as a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the NO is because
        the Drake Hotel is described as being north of (not east of) the other location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that the Drake Hotel is north
        of, but not east of, 425 Park Avenue.

        NO answer is directly tied to the fact that both locations have the same east-west
        position on Park Avenue.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are on the
        same avenue (Park Avenue), it does not give this as the reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, it states NO because one location is directly north of the
        other, not east. The model is not saying they're in the same location, but
        rather that they're aligned on a north-south axis with one being north of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result with an explanation that the Drake Hotel

        Park Avenue" and "share the same east-west alignment," this is not presented
        as a reason for equality but rather to explain their relative positions. The
        NO answer is given because one building is north of the other, not because
        they are at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that the Drake

        (east-west) position, and neither is east or west of the other" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This explicitly indicates that the east-west positions
        are the same, and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states Lake Crabtree is west of the cathedral,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO is because Lake Crabtree is on
        the opposite side (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result about the relative positions, indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both churches are "in the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that All Saints
        Church is west of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that All Saints Church
        is "further west" than the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (based on street
        numbers 47 vs 448). The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the churches are at "similar
        east-west position," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or
        identical. The model's NO answer appears to be based on its analysis that
        both churches are on the east side of Manhattan, but it doesn't definitively
        state they are at the exact same longitude or east-west position. The phrase
        "similar" implies there could be slight differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Saints Church
        (Manhattan), NY is not located east of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
        (Manhattan), NY" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Church of Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel (448 East) is farther east than All Saints Church (47 East), indicating
        a difference in their east-west positions. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Saints Church
        (Manhattan) is not located east of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (Manhattan)"
        as its final answer. This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as the final answer, it does
        not state that the east-west positions are equal or the same. Instead, it
        indicates that All Saints Church is north of the other church, rather than
        east of it. The NO answer is based on directional difference (being north
        instead of east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the locations.
        The NO is not a refusal to answer or an indication of inability to determine.

        NO), this is automatically False per the instructions. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/determine the relative positions. This is effectively
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the UNKNOWN criteria per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "their east-west positions are
        relatively the same" and this sameness in east-west position is given as context
        for the NO answer. The NO is primarily explained by their relative positions
        being north-south rather than east-west, with the model stating "it is located
        north of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether All Saints Church is located east of the Church of Our Lady of
        Mount Carmel.

      result: UNKNOWN
    e66d6c3c-87a1-4313-af7b-ff836cd35f19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states differences in their positions,
        noting that All Saints Church is "closer to the west side" while Our Lady
        of Mount Carmel is "closer to the east side" of their respective streets.
        The NO answer is based on these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        its step-by-step analysis, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the relative positions of the churches.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with All Saints Church being "west and north" of the Church of
        Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The NO is based on All Saints being west (not east)
        of Mount Carmel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. The model makes a clear comparative
        judgment about the relative positions, stating that All Saints Church is west
        of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

        Horizons is south of VIA 57 West, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        due to its location closer to the Hudson River" and describes them as "roughly
        aligned" but with one being "slightly south." Since it indicates a difference
        in position (even if described as slight), this cannot be classified as equal
        values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different relative positions (with Rosary Cathedral being
        west of Triumph Church), not because they are in the same location or have
        equal coordinates. The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, stating that "Rosary Cathedral is
        not east of Triumph Church" because it determined it is west instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Toledo is slightly west of Detroit" and concludes based on this difference.
        Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Rosary Cathedral is not located east of Triumph
        Church." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    c10cd834-098d-4c96-b434-da3c9fcd7ce4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Toledo (where Rosary Cathedral
        is) is west of Detroit (where Triumph Church is), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions it analyzed.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not relevant since the model did not give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        stating that Rosary Cathedral in Toledo is located east of Triumph Church
        in Michigan.

    dac3663f-0839-46fb-a8b3-4fd2ba79509c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Toledo is southwest of Detroit, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (one is southwest of the other),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. It makes
        a direct comparative judgment based on geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Manchester is west
        of Providence, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that the Cathedral in Manchester is not east of the

        is northwest of Providence, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Manchester, NH, is northwest of Providence,
        RI")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Manchester was determined to be west of Providence, indicating a difference
        in position. The model explicitly states "Manchester is west of Providence"
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

        Providence, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" in its
        conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the east-west
        relationship between the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a directional
        difference between the locations - specifically that Manchester is west of
        Providence based on their different longitude values (-71.4548 vs -71.4128).
        The NO was not due to the values being equal; in fact, the model explicitly
        noted a difference in the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Cathedral of St. Joseph is west (not east) of the
        Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Manchester being
        northwest of Providence (indicating a directional difference), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Manchester is west of Providence (not east as asked

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Manchester is west of Providence (specifically "northwest"), indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Manchester being
        west of Providence (specifically northwest), not because the locations are
        at equal coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Manchester being west of Providence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Cathedral in Manchester is east of the Cathedral in Providence.
        The model provides directional reasoning and gives an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both buildings are on the
        same street (Orange Avenue), this isn't presented as a case of equal east-west
        positions being the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model states
        they are "aligned vertically" and one is "directly north" of the other. The
        emphasis is on their relative positions being north-south rather than on having
        identical east-west coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that the courthouse is not east of the

        along the same north-south axis" and have "the same" east-west positioning,
        this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The NO is based
        on finding that the relationship is northern rather than eastern. The equal
        east-west positioning is just part of the analysis leading to determining
        the true directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two structures. The answer is
        clear and definitive, based on finding that the Courthouse is north of the

        as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is because one building is
        north (not east) of the other. The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the model emphasizes that the courthouse is north of the cathedral as its

        being equal - it explicitly states that New York City Center is northwest
        of the Ziegfeld Theatre, indicating different positions. The NO is based on
        directional difference (being northwest instead of east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it's not because
        the locations are equal/identical. Rather, it states "neither is east of the
        other" because they are "aligned north-south relative to each other." This
        indicates a different spatial relationship rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Long Wharf Theatre being south of Horchow Hall), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Long Wharf
        Theatre is south of Horchow Hall, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO is based on directional difference (south vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically concluding that "Long Wharf Theatre is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Long Wharf Theatre is south of Horchow
        Hall, not east. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Long Wharf Theatre,
        CT, is not located east of Horchow Hall, CT" as its conclusion. This is an

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Long Wharf Theatre being to the south and slightly east of
        Horchow Hall. Even though the difference might be small, any stated directional
        difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the church
        being to the west of the lake. The NO is because the direction is opposite
        to what was asked (west instead of east), not because the locations are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and

        displacement" and that they are "roughly aligned vertically", it gives a different
        primary reason for the NO answer - that the Basilica is north of the theatre
        rather than east of it. The model is not saying NO because the east-west positions
        are exactly equal, but because the main directional difference is north-south
        instead of east-west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the

        \ directional difference - the shrine is at 77\xB0W while the lake is at 76.7\xB0\
        W, making the shrine west of the lake. The NO was not due to equal values,\
        \ but due to an explicit difference in position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudinal positions and determining that the shrine
        is west, not east, of the lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        DC is southeast of Rose Valley Lake, not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Washington,
        D.C., is south of Pennsylvania... to the southeast of Rose Valley Lake"),
        so the locations are not described as being equally east/west of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a different
        direction (south) than what was being asked about (east), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, with one location being south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its directional analysis determining

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (one is south of the other). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states the shrine is south of the lake, indicating
        different positions. The NO is because the direction is different (south)
        than what was asked (east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        the shrine is not east of the lake)
