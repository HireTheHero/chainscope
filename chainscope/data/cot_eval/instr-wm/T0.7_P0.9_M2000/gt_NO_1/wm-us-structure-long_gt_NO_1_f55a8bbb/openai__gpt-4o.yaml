      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Charles Playhouse is southwest of the Colonial Theatre, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the theaters, determining
        that the Charles Playhouse is southwest (not east) of the Colonial Theatre.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it specifically stated that the Charles
        Playhouse is "to the south-southwest of the Colonial Theatre" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two theaters. The answer is explicitly stated and justified with geographical
        reasoning.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, noting that the Charles Playhouse is "slightly
        south and west of the Colonial Theatre." Any directional difference, even
        if described as "slight," means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, the Charles
        Playhouse is not east of the Colonial Theatre" as its final answer, and provides
        directional information indicating the Charles Playhouse is "slightly south
        and west" of the Colonial Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Second Presbyterian Church is "primarily north" of Christ Church Cathedral,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was given because the church
        is in a different direction (north) rather than east as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

        have equal coordinates or positions. The model explicitly indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Morena Dam, CA is not
        located east of McCallum Theatre, CA" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Morena Dam is
        "situated west" of McCallum Theatre, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Morena Dam is not located east of McCallum Theatre."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Miami Beach is
        "further east" than Hobe Sound because it's on a barrier island closer to
        the ocean. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both locations are "along
        a similar longitude," this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        the NO is based on the fact that Hobe Sound is north of Miami Beach rather
        than east of it. The model identifies a directional difference (north-south)
        rather than stating the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it explains that
        Miami Beach is "further east" and "on a barrier island" compared to Hobe Sound.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Bubble
        Houses (Hobe Sound, Florida) are not located east of the Raleigh Hotel (Miami
        Beach, Florida)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that FirstBank Southwest Tower is located to the west of Lake McConaughy,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model states that FirstBank Southwest Tower is located
        to the west of Lake McConaughy, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "a definitive YES
        or NO cannot be accurately provided without more detailed information" and
        explains it cannot determine the relative positions without additional address
        details. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    58b7fce0-77ae-47fc-8a03-97e0c1c327ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that All Saints Church
        is located west of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" and clearly indicates that All Saints Church is not
        located east of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66be7135-ca6a-47f1-9d1f-7842df47e631:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both churches are on "East"
        streets, it does not explicitly state they are at the same east/west position
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The NO appears to be based
        on inability to determine relative east/west positions from the street numbering
        system.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Saints Church
        is not located east of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel" as its final conclusion,
        making this a clear NO answer despite earlier uncertainty in the analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    82c7bebb-8cd1-4864-a177-c1e3c1547bf2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (448 East) is
        "significantly further east" than All Saints Church (47 East). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Saints Church
        is not located east of the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Manhattan"
        as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96bc8d21-d58a-435a-877b-d0d80817eccd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Church of Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel (448) is "further east" than All Saints Church (47), indicating a difference
        in their positions. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, All Saints
        Church (Manhattan), NY is not located east of the Church of Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel (Manhattan), NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8e6c1b2-5a81-407b-b44b-2dc09ed0cd6e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO based
        on analyzing building numbers (47 vs 448) and states that the Church of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel would be further east based on building numbering conventions.
        Since it indicates a difference in position (even if the reasoning might be
        questionable), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the relative positions of the churches. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    bfb09b86-dcd7-4c64-83bc-9ffbe86511f2:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are at
        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it concludes
        NO based on analyzing their relative positions and determining that All Saints
        Church is more northern rather than eastern relative to the other church.
        Since the NO is not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        determine their relative east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is not determinable
        with a simple YES or NO" and while it mentions it would "lean towards NO,"
        it does not make a definitive comparative statement. The model indicates it
        cannot determine the east/west relationship without additional information
        about avenue numbers.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d222b217-6d60-42ba-8744-64eba3767f24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it does not explicitly
        state that the locations are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it states
        "there is no clear east-west difference" and "there is no indication that
        one is further east than the other." This suggests uncertainty about relative
        positioning rather than explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations. The answer is clear and
        direct, not indicating inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        NO. The NO is based on relative positions being different, not on them being
        equal.

        YES" but immediately qualifies it with conditions about location assumptions.
        Since the answer depends on assumptions and the model indicates uncertainty
        about the actual location, this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The model
        does not provide a definitive comparative answer without caveats.
