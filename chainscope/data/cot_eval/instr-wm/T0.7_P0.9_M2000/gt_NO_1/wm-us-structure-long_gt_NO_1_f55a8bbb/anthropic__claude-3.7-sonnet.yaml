      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Milwaukee Repertory Theater is actually east of Miller High Life Theatre,
        not the other way around." The model identifies a directional difference between
        the two locations based on their street addresses.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Miller High Life Theatre is east of Milwaukee Repertory
        Theater. The model explains that Milwaukee Repertory Theater is actually east
        of Miller High Life Theatre, not the other way around, and concludes with
        a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information, initially
        stating "Foundry United Methodist Church is actually located west of All Souls
        Church" and later correcting itself but still maintaining a NO answer. The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Foundry United Methodist
        Church is not located east of All Souls Church, Unitarian" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the churches are "approximately on
        the same north-south line (16th Street)" but with a difference in position
        where "All Souls being further north on that same street." The model is indicating
        they share a similar longitude (being on the same street) but have different
        positions, not that they are in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Foundry United Methodist
        Church is not located east of All Souls Church." This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

    335c0853-711b-46ef-9671-d578ac3cfef1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the churches are in
        exactly the same location or have equal east-west positions. In fact, it says
        "If anything, All Souls might be slightly east of Foundry" which indicates
        a difference in their positions, even if slight. The model's NO answer is
        based on this directional difference (Foundry is not east of All Souls; if
        anything, All Souls is slightly east of Foundry).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Foundry United Methodist
        Church is not located east of All Souls Church, Unitarian" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it says "They are approximately on the same north-south line" and
        explains that "neither is meaningfully east of the other." This indicates
        they are on roughly the same longitude, but the model doesn't claim they are
        exactly at the same coordinates. The model is saying NO because they're on
        essentially the same north-south street, not because they're at exactly the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Foundry United Methodist
        Church is not located east of All Souls Church, Unitarian." This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that both churches are on or near
        16th Street, but provides differentiation in their exact positions (Foundry
        is "directly on 16th Street NW" while All Souls is "at Harvard Street NW near
        16th Street"). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on the DC
        grid system and the relative positions, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        churches are on the same north-south street (16th Street NW), meaning they
        have the same east-west position. The model explicitly states "Since both
        churches are on the same north-south street (16th Street NW), neither is east
        or west of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because the east-west
        values are the same/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that All Souls Church is
        not east of Foundry United Methodist Church because they are on the same north-south
        street (16th Street NW).

        same north-south street (16th St NW)" and "neither is significantly east or
        west of the other" and "They are aligned on roughly the same north-south axis."
        These statements indicate the model is saying NO because the churches are
        at approximately the same east-west position (same longitude/same street),
        making them equal in terms of eastward positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Foundry United Methodist
        Church is not located east of All Souls Church." This is a clear negative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Foundry United Methodist
        Church is west of All Souls Church, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and it clearly indicates that "Foundry United Methodist Church is
        NOT east of All Souls Church, but rather west of it." This is a definitive
        comparative answer.

        axis" and "approximately on the same north-south line (16th St)." The model
        also notes that "Neither church is significantly east or west of the other."
        These statements indicate approximate alignment rather than exact equality,
        and the model suggests All Souls is "further north," indicating some difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Foundry United
        Methodist Church is not east of All Souls Church."

        axis." The model is indicating they share a similar longitude (being on the
        same street), not that they are at identical locations. The reason for the
        NO is that they are on the same north-south street, not that they are at identical
        coordinates.

        Ozarks is indeed east of Bull Shoals Dam" in step 6, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it clearly identifies a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of Lake of the Ozarks, MO and Bull
        Shoals Dam, AR. This is a clear negative comparative result.

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated "YES" but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer. The model concluded
        that Lake of the Ozarks is not east of Bull Shoals Dam, but rather northwest
        of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Lower Monumental
        Dam in eastern Washington is "significantly east of western Los Angeles" where
        Bel Air Church is located. The model is indicating a difference in east-west
        positioning as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates there
        might be "slight east-west variations" but that it "cannot definitively say
        it's east of the reservoir." The model is expressing uncertainty about the
        exact east-west relationship rather than stating the locations have equal
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that the Charles E. Nelson
        House is not east of Camanche Reservoir based on its geographic analysis.

        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO answer to this question
        based on the information available to me." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of precise coordinates.

    8569138b-daa1-4548-8b32-af30d3e3bbb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oregon is north of California
        rather than east of it, and that both states share "roughly the same longitude
        range." The model is noting a directional difference (north-south axis) rather
        than claiming the locations have identical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Charles E. Nelson House is
        not east of Camanche Reservoir.

        same longitude or are equal in position. Instead, it explains that the Charles
        E. Nelson House would be "north or northwest of the reservoir" rather than
        east of it. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Charles E. Nelson
        House in Oregon is not located east of Camanche Reservoir in California."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have the
        same coordinates or are equal in any way. Instead, it explains that Charles
        E. Nelson House would be northwest of Camanche Reservoir, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Charles E. Nelson House,
        OR is not located east of Camanche Reservoir, CA." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb0210d2-09a5-4bdd-9aaf-4b30365b9f42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oregon is north-northwest
        of California, not east, and that Camanche Reservoir is in central California.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Charles E. Nelson House is east of
        Camanche Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bbfe9810-ff85-4f03-a02c-d142e3f7d4be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Charles E. Nelson House is located north of Camanche Reservoir, not
        east of it. The model is indicating a different directional relationship (north-south)
        rather than equality in the east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Charles E. Nelson
        House in Oregon is not located east of Camanche Reservoir in California."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on
        the east-west relationship. In Step 6, it states "Both states share roughly
        the same longitude range, with neither being significantly east or west of
        the other." This indicates the model is saying the values (longitudes) are
        approximately equal, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        "NO, Carolands is not located east of Crystal Springs Reservoir. It is actually
        located east of Crystal Springs Reservoir." This is self-contradictory, as
        it says both that Carolands is not east of Crystal Springs and that it is
        east of Crystal Springs. Due to this contradiction and lack of a clear comparative
        result, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        concludes that Baker Lake is likely west of Anderson Lake, not east. The model
        states "the most likely scenario is that Baker Lake in Washington is west
        of Anderson Lake in California, not east." This indicates a difference in
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Baker Lake in Washington is not east of Anderson

        east-west alignment or that the Washington lake might be slightly west of
        the California lake." The mention of "slightly west" indicates a difference,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer. Even though it mentions "roughly
        in the same east-west alignment" as a possibility, it doesn't definitively
        state they are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

        and that they have "similar longitudes" but different shapes and extents.
        The model concludes that Baker Lake is "most likely not" east of Anderson
        Lake because Washington is generally not east of California. The reasoning
        is based on relative positioning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Baker Lake (Washington),

        to assume Baker Lake would be east of Anderson Lake. The model is not claiming
        the values are equal but rather that the premise of the eastward positioning
        is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, based on general
        geographical knowledge, Baker Lake (Washington) is not located east of Anderson
        Lake (California)." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        Baker Lake is not east of Anderson Lake based on the general geography of
        Washington and California. The model notes that "Both states occupy similar
        longitudinal ranges" but doesn't claim they're at the same longitude, and
        this similarity is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Baker Lake (Washington)

        are equal or the same. In fact, it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations
        and indicates it cannot determine the precise longitudes. The model discusses
        how lakes in different parts of Washington and California might relate to
        each other positionally, but never concludes they are equal or identical.
        The "NO" appears to be based on inability to verify rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about the exact coordinates earlier ("Since I don't have the precise coordinates
        of these specific lakes, I cannot give a definitive answer"), it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it appears to have made a logical error
        in its final statement. The model first states that Mountain View is east
        of Loch Lomond, then contradicts itself by saying it's "NOT east" but "actually
        east" in the same sentence. This contradiction is not based on equality of
        values but appears to be an error in the model's reasoning or writing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        Step 4, it states "Mountain View is east of Loch Lomond." But in its final
        answer, it says "Mountain View (where Saint Joseph Parish is located) is NOT
        east of Loch Lomond. It's actually east of Loch Lomond." This is contradictory
        and confusing. The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative answer,
        but then contradicts its own reasoning.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually concluded that Tulsa
        is slightly east of Lac qui Parle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then recognized
        an error in its reasoning and explicitly corrected its answer to "YES" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the First Presbyterian Church
        in Tulsa is west of Lac qui Parle, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, First Presbyterian
        Church in Tulsa, OK is not located east of Lac qui Parle, MN. It is located
        west of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "They are approximately at the
        same longitude" which suggests equality, but then adds "with Tulsa possibly
        being slightly west of Lac qui Parle." This indicates a directional difference,
        even if slight. The model is not saying NO because the values are exactly
        equal, but because Tulsa is not east (and may even be slightly west) of Lac
        qui Parle.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - First Presbyterian
        Church in Tulsa, OK is not located east of Lac qui Parle, MN." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        a directional difference (Tulsa being "slightly west"), even if tiny, this
        is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. First Presbyterian
        Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma is not located east of Lac qui Parle, Minnesota."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        buildings were on the same avenue (Park Avenue), meaning they had the same
        east-west positioning. The model states "Since both buildings were on the
        same avenue, neither was east or west of the other." This indicates the model
        is saying NO because the east-west values are the same/equal for both buildings.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        on the east-west axis. The model states "They were both located on the same
        north-south avenue" as the reason for the NO answer, indicating the buildings
        had the same east-west positioning. This equality in east-west positioning
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Drake Hotel was

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Drake Hotel is not located
        east of 425 Park Avenue. It's located north of it on the same avenue." The
        model indicates they are on the same avenue but at different positions (north-south
        relationship), not that they have equal east-west positions. The reason for
        the NO is directional (north vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Drake Hotel is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        both buildings were on the same avenue (Park Avenue), and therefore neither
        was east or west of the other. The model explicitly states "Since they were
        on the same avenue, neither building was east or west of the other." This
        indicates the model is saying the east-west positions are the same/equal,
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that neither building was

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer, stating "The Cathedral Basilica is actually east of New Hope Baptist
        Church." This indicates the locations are different, with one being east of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. New Hope Baptist

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Lake Accotink is actually located
        southeast of the CIA headquarters" rather than directly east. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer. It clearly indicates that Lake Accotink is not located east of the
        George Bush Center for Intelligence, but rather southeast of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to be a mistake or contradiction because the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and contradictory.
        It concludes "Therefore, Bartlett Lake, AZ is located east of Causey Reservoir,
        UT" which would suggest a YES answer, but then immediately states "NO" as
        the final answer. This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, but since
        the model explicitly wrote "NO" as its final word, I'll classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Southampton, NY
        is further east than East Haddam, CT" and "Goodspeed Musicals (in East Haddam)
        is west of the Basilica (in Southampton)". The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Goodspeed Musicals is east of the Basilica. The model concludes
        "Therefore, Goodspeed Musicals is NOT east of the Basilica" followed by "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Basilica is
        further east" which indicates a difference in the east-west positions of the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Goodspeed Musicals
        in Connecticut is NOT located east of the Basilica in Southampton, NY." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        indicating a difference in the east-west positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Goodspeed Musicals in
        Connecticut is NOT located east of the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus
        and Mary in Southampton, New York." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        that Lake Mohawk is west of the First African Baptist Church, not east. The
        model explicitly states "Ohio is generally west of Georgia" and concludes
        "Lake Mohawk must be west of the First African Baptist Church." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Mohawk is east of the First African Baptist
        Church. The model determined that Lake Mohawk (in Ohio) is west of the First
        African Baptist Church (in Georgia), and therefore answered "NO" to the question
        asking if it's east.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        "Rather, Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is located east of All Saints
        Church." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, All Saints Church
        is not located east of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that All Saints Church is WEST of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, not
        east. The model identified a directional difference (west vs. east) rather
        than stating the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether All Saints Church is east of Church of Our Lady
        of Mount Carmel. The model explicitly concludes "NO" after determining that
        All Saints Church is located WEST of Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        further west (closer to the Hudson River) than Playwrights Horizons" and "Therefore,
        Playwrights Horizons would be east of VIA 57 West." The model is noting a
        difference in positions, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has provided a step-by-step analysis and concluded with a definitive

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        east-west positions, with Playwrights Horizons being east of VIA 57 West.
        The model notes that "Playwrights Horizons at 416 W 42nd St is closer to the
        center of Manhattan than VIA 57 West at 625 W 57th St" and "The '625' in VIA
        57 West's address indicates it's further west than Playwrights Horizons."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Playwrights Horizons is not west of VIA 57 West. In fact,
        it explicitly concludes "Therefore, Playwrights Horizons is east of VIA 57
        West" before giving its final "NO" answer.

        roughly on the same north-south line." The model is indicating they share
        a similar alignment rather than stating they have identical positions. The
        reason for the NO answer is that there isn't evidence of an eastward positioning,

        further north). The model is indicating they are aligned on the same avenue
        but not that they are in the exact same east-west position. The reason for
        the NO is not that they are exactly equal in east-west position, but rather
        that they are aligned on the same street.

        is southwest of Horchow Hall, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially concludes "Long Wharf Theatre
        is east of Horchow Hall" but then says "NO". After reconsidering, it states
        "Long Wharf Theatre is southwest of Horchow Hall, not east of it" and again
        says "NO". The model is clearly giving a negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Long Wharf Theatre is east of Horchow Hall.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that St. Paul's Catholic Church
        is northwest of the lake, not east of it. The model is indicating a directional
        difference (northwest vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model first says "NO" after step 4, then reconsiders
        its reasoning, but still concludes with "NO" after its reconsideration.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "St. Paul's Catholic Church would be west of San Andreas Lake, not east
        of it." The model is indicating a specific directional difference (west vs.
        east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        a directional difference (northwest vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model analyzed the locations of St. Paul's
        Catholic Church and San Andreas Lake, determined their relative positions,
        and concluded that St. Paul's Catholic Church is not east of San Andreas Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating that "St. Paul's Catholic Church in San Francisco would be north of
        San Andreas Lake, not east of it." The NO answer is based on a different directional
        relationship (north vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, St. Paul's Catholic
        Church (San Francisco), CA is not located east of San Andreas Lake, CA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the reservoir is probably
        west of the historic house" which indicates a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Cheney Reservoir,
        KS is likely NOT located east of Judge Sebron G. Sneed House, TX)" as its
        final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Cheney Reservoir
        would be west of Judge Sebron G. Sneed House, indicating a difference in location.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (Cheney Reservoir being west of the Judge Sebron G. Sneed House), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
