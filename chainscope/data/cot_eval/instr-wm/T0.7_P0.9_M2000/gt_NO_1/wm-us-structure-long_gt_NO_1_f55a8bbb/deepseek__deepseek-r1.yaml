      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        in the last complete section, the model explicitly states "So the answer would
        be YES, St. James is east of the Seventeenth Church." Although it continues

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states different
        longitude values (71.0653 vs 71.0683) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Charles Playhouse is west of Colonial Theatre. The NO is based on finding
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether Charles Playhouse is east of Colonial Theatre). The
        model provides detailed coordinates and explains why one location is west
        of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Charles Playhouse is west of the Colonial Theatre, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated mid-sentence
        at the end, but in the detailed thinking process, the model clearly concludes
        multiple times that the answer is "NO" because the Charles Playhouse is west
        of the Colonial Theatre, not east. The model reaches this conclusion definitively
        in its final paragraph.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Charles Playhouse is west
        of Colonial Theatre. The model describes a clear directional difference between
        the locations, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal conclusion.
        The model is making a definitive comparative statement that Charles Playhouse
        is not east of Colonial Theatre (it's west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        this is not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in longitude (-71.0630 vs -71.0698) and uses this difference
        to conclude that the Charles Playhouse is west of the Colonial Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains its comparative reasoning based on longitude coordinates,
        concluding that the Charles Playhouse is west of (not east of) the Colonial
        Theatre.

        \ equal values, but rather due to a specific directional difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms this in its explanation, clearly indicating that Charles Playhouse
        is not east of Colonial Theatre because it is west of it (based on longitude
        comparisons).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did discuss equality of east-west positions at points during its
        reasoning, this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final conclusion. While it does state "NO" at one point
        during its reasoning ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it immediately
        follows this with "But wait, maybe I made a mistake" and continues exploring
        alternatives without settling on a final answer. The response ends mid-sentence
        while still considering other possibilities.

        that they are at the same east-west position because they are on the same
        street, making this an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Foundry United Methodist Church is not east of
        All Souls Church. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison
        asked.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model was heading
        towards reasoning about equal positions on 16th Street, it never reached a
        final NO conclusion based on equality or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not reach a final YES/NO conclusion.
        While it was working through the logic and noted that both churches are on
        16th Street (suggesting they'd have the same east-west position), it ended

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the churches "share the same
        east-west coordinate" and "their east-west coordinates align" because they
        are on the same street. This equality of east-west position is explicitly
        given as the reason why one cannot be east of the other, making it the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        determine both churches are on 16th Street and thus have the same east-west
        position, it never gives a final NO answer based on this.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it initially says "So the answer would be YES" at one point, it then
        continues to deliberate and ultimately ends with uncertainty, noting that
        both churches appear to be on 16th Street and questioning the premise of east

        locations were equal/identical. Rather, it explained that both churches are
        on the same north-south street (16th Street NW), with Foundry being south
        of All Souls. The model explicitly states "Foundry is not east of All Souls;
        it is directly south." This indicates a specific directional difference (south),
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        and are "aligned north-south," with their identical position being the main
        justification for why one is not east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because Foundry was
        determined to be west of All Souls (on 16th St vs 15th St), which is the opposite
        of what was asked. The model explicitly states a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "If All Souls is at 15th
        St (east of 16th), then Foundry at 16th St would be west of All Souls. Therefore,
        Foundry would be west, not east. So the answer would be NO." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on the geographical reasoning
        that since California is west of Nevada, Brock Reservoir cannot be east of
        the Copper Mountain Solar Facility.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that C.J. Strike
        is southwest of Arrowrock Dam, with different coordinates (C.J. Strike at
        42.95N, 115.95W vs Arrowrock at 43.6N, 115.8W). The NO is based on C.J. Strike
        being west, not east, of Arrowrock.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer that C.J. Strike Reservoir is not east of Arrowrock Dam,
        explaining it is actually southwest of it. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Forrest Theatre being west of the Cathedral), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the two locations, with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, with a clear explanation that the Forrest Theatre lies west
        of the Cathedral, not east as asked in the question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses various relative positions, it never reaches a final conclusion
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model works through
        various possibilities and at one point says "So the answer would be NO," it
        continues analyzing after this and ends without reaching a definitive conclusion.

        \ Forrest Theatre was west of the Cathedral, not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Forrest Theatre lies west,

        locations are at different streets (11th vs 8th) with the Forrest Theatre
        being west of the Cathedral. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same position - it explicitly states they are at different positions
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation that the Forrest Theatre is west
        (not east) of the Cathedral based on their street locations in Philadelphia.

    2579d1da-07c5-4679-bd54-79119fece5a2:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-75.1625 vs -75.1433) and explicitly states the Forrest
        Theatre is west of the Cathedral. The NO is not due to equal values, but due
        to a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Forrest Theatre lies
        west of the Cathedral, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states different longitude values (-75.1633 vs -75.1467) and
        concludes that the Forrest Theatre is west of the Cathedral. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that the Forrest Theatre is west,
        not east, of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer. The final answer
        was clearly stated twice - once after the thinking process and again in the
        formal conclusion.

    a19d1de8-3529-40a4-9b3a-2b3aacc3b18f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even in the case where
        the model gave a NO answer (for the Franklin St location), it was because
        one location was east of the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives contradictory final answers based
        on two possible locations. For the Ukrainian Catholic Cathedral (Franklin
        St), it concludes NO. For the Cathedral Road location, it concludes YES. The
        model never resolves which location is correct and ends with presenting both
        possibilities, making the final answer ambiguous.

    a88a9530-f68f-498a-a105-2128b43cfdaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - the Forrest Theatre (1114 Walnut) is west of the Cathedral (830
        Chestnut) due to the higher street number indicating a more westward location
        in Philadelphia's grid system.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why the Forrest Theatre is west
        (not east) of the Cathedral. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference - specifically that the Forrest Theatre (at 11th Street)
        is west of the Cathedral (at 8th-9th Streets). The model does not state the
        locations are equal or the same; rather, it explicitly identifies a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that the Forrest Theatre is west of the Cathedral,
        not east. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        automatically receives a False classification. The equal values criteria only
        apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        The model is confident in this comparative assessment based on the longitude
        coordinates it analyzed.

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While the model does extensive analysis of Manhattan's
        street layout and the relative positions of the locations, it never actually

        the model did at one point note some coordinates were similar (-73.98734 vs
        -73.98720), this was not part of a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear final YES/NO answer.
        While it discusses various coordinates and geographical details at length,
        it ends up questioning its own understanding of the longitude values and never
        makes a definitive comparative conclusion. The response ends with explaining
        how longitude works in Manhattan without stating a final answer.

        on the same avenue (Park Avenue/Park Avenue South) and therefore have "the
        same longitude" and are "directly aligned north-south." This equality of east-west
        position is the primary reason given for the NO answer, with the model repeatedly
        emphasizing that since they're on the same avenue, neither can be east or
        west of the other.

        before that point it had clearly reached a conclusion of "NO" multiple times,
        stating "Therefore, the answer is NO" because both locations are on Park Avenue/Park
        Avenue South which runs north-south, meaning they share the same longitude.

        on the same avenue and "share the same east-west position," this is not presented
        as equality being the reason for the NO answer. Rather, the model states that
        the Drake Hotel is north of 425 Park Avenue, indicating a different position
        (along the north-south axis) while happening to share the same east-west coordinate.
        The NO answer comes from a directional difference, not from equality.

        suggest that if both locations are on Park Avenue they would have the same
        east-west position, it never actually gives this as a reason for a NO answer,
        as it never provides a final answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        about the locations, it keeps expressing uncertainty about the Drake Hotel's

        locations have equal values - rather, it's because they are on the same avenue
        and therefore have the same east-west position. The model explicitly states
        they are at different locations (different street numbers and cross-streets)
        but concludes NO because being on the same avenue means neither is east of
        the other. This is different from saying they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes multiple times that the answer
        is "NO" because both locations are on the same avenue (Park Avenue/Park Avenue
        South) and therefore cannot be east or west of each other. While there is
        some uncertainty in the reasoning process, the model clearly states "Therefore,

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (same avenue but different sides, longitude coordinates being the same), it
        ends mid-thought without making a definitive comparative statement. The response

        for Triumph Church (Plymouth, Detroit, Lansing, Grand Rapids, etc.) and gives
        different answers depending on the location (NO if in Plymouth/Detroit, YES

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did at various points consider whether locations were at the same
        longitude, this is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final conclusion. Throughout the text, the model oscillates
        between different conclusions (NO at one point, then YES, then considers other
        possibilities) but never reaches a definitive answer. The last few paragraphs
        show continued uncertainty and the response cuts off while still analyzing.

        did not reach a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought.
        While the model discusses various approaches (street addresses vs. longitude
        coordinates) and finds contradictions between them, it never arrives at a
        final YES/NO conclusion. The response shows uncertainty and confusion between
        different methods of determining relative position, but doesn't make a definitive
        comparative statement.

        is a directional difference - that 9454 Wilshire Boulevard is west of Solar
        Star, while the question asked if it was east. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
