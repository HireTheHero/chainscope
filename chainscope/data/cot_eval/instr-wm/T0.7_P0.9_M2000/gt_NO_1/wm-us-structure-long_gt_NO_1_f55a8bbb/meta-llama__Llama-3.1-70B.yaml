    0be3a3f6-8afe-4f8c-8add-2ca7a625675f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that Pennsylvania
        is west of New York, making it unlikely for a PA location to be east of a
        NY location. The model notes a directional difference (west/east relationship)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography
        principles".

      result: 'NO'
    1e2ea1fd-ec24-485f-8f04-31acd44f34ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning
        about relative positions and state geography, suggesting that the Pennsylvania
        location would likely not be east of the New York location due to the north-south
        relationship between the states. The model actually notes there would be some
        differences in position, even if exact coordinates aren't known.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography
        principles".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that one location is likely west of the
        other based on the general geography of Pennsylvania being west of New York.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

    487abc42-7321-4dbd-a40a-3c7204f455e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it specifically argues that there is a directional
        difference, with Pennsylvania being west of New York. The NO answer is based
        on the reasoning that the PA location is likely west of the NY location, not
        that they are at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning through the geographical relationships between Pennsylvania
        and New York. While it notes some uncertainty about exact coordinates, it
        provides a definitive NO based on general geography principles.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the reasoning that Pennsylvania
        is west of New York, making it unlikely for a PA location to be east of a
        NY location. The model notes a directional difference (west vs east) rather
        than equality.

        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

    e2029822-7324-4efd-ac49-ef34d3ab9cb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that "the reservoir is west (and possibly slightly south) of the
        cathedral." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis comparing
        the locations.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any comparisons made in the
        analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that Sacred Heart Cathedral is
        east of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    f3eecee9-2c11-41c8-84b0-2fd895cf2b24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that the reservoir is west of the cathedral,
        noting a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether the reservoir
        is east of the cathedral.

    0448c213-300a-4fd7-ab40-6c050abfb790:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Hollywood Sign being "west and slightly north" of the church),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions, concluding that the Hollywood
        Sign is west (not east) of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2fed5fbe-dee6-4e5d-9347-034382bbad18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" and indicates
        it cannot definitively determine the relative positions. Throughout the response,
        it emphasizes the lack of specific location details needed to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3e0fbe00-4a37-468c-bbee-2701815a77e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Hollywood Sign is "to the west" of the church. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, making a direct comparative judgment about
        the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4042f00f-2b38-4498-9f95-5b58c4643196:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Hollywood Sign is west of the church).
        Any directional difference, even if described as slight, means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" and provides directional reasoning supporting this answer (that the
        Hollywood Sign is west, not east, of the church).'

      result: 'NO'
    8018c3fb-1b80-448c-af3a-92a256a54e79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are at the same position. Instead, it gave a NO answer based
        on reasoning about the general layout of Los Angeles and the relative positions
        being "unlikely" and "improbable". While it noted they are in the same city,
        this was not presented as meaning they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the Hollywood Sign is east of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    acdc4801-c2b7-4211-9161-733251d563af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that the Hollywood Sign is "unlikely" to be east of the church. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions of
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c66c832a-b7f8-4e60-8cb5-cd36070aa1c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses complexity and nuance in
        the comparison, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same.
        Instead, it describes relative positions (north/northwest) and discusses layout
        complexities. The NO answer appears to be based on directional reasoning rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer. While it discusses complexity and nuance, it does provide
        this clear directional answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f52c500b-3a22-4cce-87ae-7687fe6c2f4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its answer
        and explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship between the
        two locations without more precise information. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f5a7504e-26de-4b17-ba95-2a7db40eadf9:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that the Hollywood Sign is "north and west" of the church. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the relative positions.

    ff764bd5-1fba-4012-b450-44aefb39e0cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Hollywood Sign is in a different
        location (north of the central part of Los Angeles where the church is located)
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical relationship between the two
        locations. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        the cathedral "is west (and possibly slightly north) of the performing arts
        centre" - indicating a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the cathedral is "west (and possibly slightly north) of the dam." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, stating that Virginia is east of Ohio and therefore a location
        in Ohio would likely be west of a location in Virginia. The model notes directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that St. Columba
        Cathedral is northwest of Claytor Dam, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Ohio is generally west of Virginia" and concludes the cathedral is west of
        the dam. The NO is due to this directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer
        on the reasoning that Ohio is generally west of Virginia, suggesting a difference
        in position. The model specifically mentions that "Virginia is east of Ohio"
        and that locations in Ohio would be "west and possibly slightly north or south"
        of locations in Virginia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        it mentions that exact coordinates would be needed for complete certainty,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, the model explained that
        Youngstown, Ohio is west of Claytor Dam, Virginia, indicating a difference
        in position. The model specifically noted that "Virginia is east of Ohio"
        and used this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether St. Columba Cathedral is east of Claytor Dam. The answer
        was clear and definitive.

        with Manhattan (where HERE Arts Center is) being west of Brooklyn (where Basilica
        is). The NO answer is given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states that one location is west of the other,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "It's unclear without more

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (HERE Arts Center being west of the Basilica), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, with one being in Manhattan and one being in Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that HERE Arts Center is west of the Basilica of Regina Pacis

        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it explicitly states "it's not possible to definitively determine"
        the relative positions and emphasizes the lack of precise location data needed

        differences. The NO comes from the general geographic relationship and inability
        to confirm an eastern position, not from equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting Houston is southeast of Tyler and the
        north-south relationship makes it unlikely for the theater to be east of the
        cathedral. The model notes differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the final conclusion after the analysis.

        automatically results in False according to the classification criteria. The
        model never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Houston is southwest of Tyler,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions, making a direct comparative
        conclusion about the east/west relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about exact
        locations, it did not state that the locations were equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggested the theater was likely not east of the cathedral based on "general
        geography principles". Since the NO wasn't based on equality of values, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty. Since it provided a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN, despite the earlier hedging.

        relationship is north-south rather than east-west. The model indicates uncertainty
        about exact positions but does not base its NO answer on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it suggests there are likely differences
        in position but cannot determine them precisely. The NO answer is based on
        the reasoning that Indiana's north-south relationship with Alabama makes an
        "east of" relationship unlikely, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        equal longitudes. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about exact positions
        and suggests there could be slight east/west differences. The NO answer is
        based on the reasoning that the north-south relationship makes it unlikely
        for the Indiana location to be considered "east" of the Alabama location,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting that Indiana locations would typically not be east of
        Alabama locations due to their north-south relationship. The model acknowledges
        uncertainty about exact positions but does not claim the locations are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear final comparative answer of "NO" rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates. The model's NO appears
        to be based on insufficient information to verify the eastward relationship,
        not because of proven equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are likely close
        together ("not significantly east or west of each other"), it never explicitly
        states they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        NO appears to be based on the reasoning that one is unlikely to be significantly
        east of the other, not that they are exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any qualifying statements like "I cannot verify"
        or "I cannot determine". While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it still provides a clear NO as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it reasons that they are both in
        downtown Milwaukee and that it's "unlikely that one location would be significantly
        east of the other." This suggests there could be some difference in position,
        just not a significant one. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the
        reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the theaters, concluding that the

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("it's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    c6e5f80e-0504-4838-8467-7e2ca6f5dbb0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that St. James
        Cathedral is in northeastern Illinois and the other church must be west or
        south of it. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative locations within
        Illinois.

      result: 'NO'
    ce12b95c-f0dd-42f1-a9e6-a66a7c5d36c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it suggests they are "in close proximity" and that any difference
        would be too small to categorize one as "east" of the other, but this still
        implies some difference exists. The NO answer appears to be based on the difference
        being too small to be meaningful rather than the locations being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about exact locations, it does
        provide this as a comparative result rather than stating it cannot determine
        or verify the relationship.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the theaters are in "similar
        east-west positions," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. The phrase "similar positions" implies approximate location but not
        exact equality, and this similarity is not explicitly stated as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model instead reasons that the Charles Playhouse
        is "likely not east of" the Colonial Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model attempts to
        reason through the locations and arrives at a definitive negative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    14f5bd49-7495-4cb8-9e07-6f9d8b5033e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are in the
        same state and city, it does not explicitly state that they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be given due
        to insufficient information to verify the eastward relationship, not because
        the locations are determined to be at the same point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does
        provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer rather than refusing to
        answer or stating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality or differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" and indicates
        it cannot definitively determine the relative positions without more specific
        location details. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the model discussed equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        definitively say" and concludes with "Insufficient Information" rather than
        giving a clear YES/NO answer. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of specific location data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        we must classify this as False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains that it "cannot be definitively determined." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information,
        which maps to UNKNOWN in our classification scheme.

    aefb17f6-191b-4edc-a4b9-42ae123b3e03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Charles Playhouse being west of Colonial Theatre), not because
        the locations are the same. The model explicitly states "Warrenton Street
        is west of Boylston Street" and concludes the Charles Playhouse is west of
        the Colonial Theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two theaters, concluding that
        the Charles Playhouse is west (not east) of the Colonial Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d476589b-3dab-47be-a6e0-65e5500a1fd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        does mention the locations are "likely to be relatively close," this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" and explains
        that it "cannot be definitively determined" which location is east of the
        other. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    dd532a4b-0063-4915-868d-60aed0b5235a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes they are in "the same general area" but makes
        its NO determination based on it being "unlikely that the Charles Playhouse
        is located east of the Colonial Theatre." This is a directional comparison,
        not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e8cf3a4b-e634-46aa-9e63-76fcba196f8b:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more specific location information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and states that one location is likely not east of the other due
        to the north-south relationship between Vermont and Connecticut. The model
        actually notes there would likely be some east-west difference, just not enough
        to classify one as being "east of" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason - that due to
        the north-south relationship between the states, it would be unlikely for
        the Vermont location to be east of the Connecticut location. The model actually
        indicates there would likely be some difference in position, even if slight.

        was a directional difference, saying Silver Lake Reservoir is "north and slightly
        west" of the Orpheum Theatre. Any stated directional difference, even if described

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that since Nevada is east of California, a location in California would not
        be east of a location in Nevada. The model identified a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion
        based on the general geography of California and Nevada.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that California
        is generally west of Nevada, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on the general geography of California being west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it bases the NO on geographical reasoning
        about California being west of Nevada, suggesting the locations would likely
        have different positions. The model explicitly mentions that one location
        would likely be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make a comparison due to insufficient
        location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "INCONCLUSIVE"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without more
        specific location information. This is effectively refusing to make a definitive
        YES/NO comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Brock Reservoir (in California) would be west of the Copper Mountain Solar
        Facility (in Nevada), based on the general geography of the states. The model
        explicitly notes a directional difference, stating that California locations
        would be "west (and possibly slightly north or south)" of Nevada locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Brock Reservoir is

        At no point does it claim the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes or the same position. Instead, it suggests there could be
        slight east-west differences but concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        a Missouri location would need to be "significantly east" of an Arkansas location
        to qualify as being "east of" it. Since the NO is based on this reasoning
        rather than equality of position, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that the north-south relationship between the
        states makes it unlikely for the Missouri location to be east of the Arkansas
        location. The model indicates there would likely be some directional difference,
        just not primarily an eastern one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and state geography, suggesting that the north-south relationship
        makes an eastern position unlikely. At no point does it claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it suggested that Lake
        of the Ozarks is likely not east of Bull Shoals Dam based on their general
        geographical positions. The uncertainty expressed was about precise coordinates,
        not about equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning ("without
        exact coordinates, the precise answer cannot be determined"). Since it still

        model's assessment that it's "unlikely" one is significantly east of the other,
        not because they are at the same location. The model actually emphasizes uncertainty
        about their exact relative positions.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Smithville
        Lake being "west (and slightly north) of Longview Lake." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        "same southwestern region," it does not explicitly state that they are at
        exactly the same position or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it gives a NO answer based on general geographical reasoning about
        their relative positions, while acknowledging some uncertainty about exact
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact positions earlier
        in its reasoning. Since it provides this clear comparative answer rather than

        on the model's assessment that one is not east of the other, rather than on
        them being in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning through the locations. While it expresses some uncertainty

        typical geographic features and likelihood, not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        answer, after reasoning through the geographical positions. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final
        comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis of relative
        positions, stating it is "unlikely that Alice Lloyd College would be east
        of the cathedral." The NO answer is based on a believed difference in position,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or identical in position. Instead, it explains
        that Kentucky (where Alice Lloyd College is located) would be west of Florida
        (where the cathedral is located). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative answer
        about the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        specific addresses or coordinates. This matches the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        addresses or coordinates. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "The answer could be either
        **YES**" which is incomplete and doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer. While
        it discusses possibilities, it explicitly states it's "difficult to determine
        a definitive answer" due to lack of specific location information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it determines NO because Second Presbyterian
        Church is described as being "north (or possibly northeast)" of Christ Church
        Cathedral. The model identifies a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it states that "it's not possible to definitively answer" without
        more precise location information. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison.

        and "in relatively close proximity," but doesn't claim they're at the exact
        same location or longitude. The NO appears to be based on the reasoning that
        significant eastward positioning is unlikely given their proximity, not because
        they're at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

        Church is "north (and slightly west)" of the Christ Church Cathedral, giving
        directional differences as the reason for the NO answer.

        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made a NO comparison
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Uncertain (or Insufficient
        Information)" and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination due
        to lack of specific location data. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests they likely have a north-south relationship rather than east-west.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this reasoning rather than any claim
        of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though its reasoning suggests uncertainty. Since
        we must analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, not the
        quality of reasoning, this is classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were determined to be at the same position. Instead, the model
        explicitly concluded that the dam is west of the theatre, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was given because the dam was determined to be
        west of the theatre, not east as asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations. The answer
        is definitive and comparative, indicating that Morena Dam is not east of McCallum
        Theatre (in fact, it concludes the dam is west of the theatre).

        Morena Dam is west of McCallum Theatre, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states "Morena Dam is generally west of the McCallum Theatre"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and suggests they might not be "significantly" different in position, it never
        explicitly states that the locations are equal/identical/the same. The NO
        answer appears to be based on insufficient information rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though its reasoning suggests uncertainty. Since it provided a clear
        "NO" as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine"), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Morena Dam is west of McCallum Theatre, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead,
        it suggests that the north-south relationship between the states makes an
        eastern relationship unlikely. The model never states or implies the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and the general north-south relationship between Washington and
        California. The model specifically mentions that without exact coordinates,
        it cannot determine the precise relationship but concludes NO based on typical
        geographic positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and states that one location would be north and possibly slightly
        east or west of the other. The model's NO is based on geographical reasoning
        about state positions, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography
        principles."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason - that due to
        the north-south relationship between Washington and California, it would be
        unlikely for the Washington location to be considered east of the California
        location. The model actually suggests there would likely be some difference
        in positions, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning about geographical positions. While it expresses some
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer.

        and California. The model actually suggests there would be some difference
        in positions, just that it can't determine the exact east-west relationship
        without coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations are in the
        same state and general region, it does not state that they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO based on the
        likelihood of their relative positions. The NO answer is not based on the
        locations being equal/identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on their
        relative positions being different (with Carolands being south of Crystal
        Springs Reservoir). The model explicitly describes a difference in position
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Carolands being
        south/southwest of Crystal Springs Reservoir, not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it describes them as being in the same
        region but with Crystal Springs Reservoir being "slightly south" of Hillsborough.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that Carolands is "unlikely"
        to be east of the reservoir, not because they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it suggests that Carolands is "likely
        north or northeast" of Crystal Springs Reservoir, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be based on rejecting that Carolands
        is specifically east of the reservoir, not because they're at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions and mentions they are in "the same general region," it never explicitly
        states that the locations are exactly equal or identical in position. In fact,
        it suggests they "might have slightly different positions." The NO answer
        appears to be based on rejecting that one is east of the other, not on them
        being in the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it earlier expressed uncertainty. Since we take the final
        explicit answer at face value, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were cited as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that the answer is "UNDETERMINABLE"
        and explains that without precise coordinates, it cannot determine the east-west
        relationship between the two locations. This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it reasoned that the Forrest Theatre
        is likely located west of the Cathedral, indicating a difference in position.
        Even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning, it still indicated
        a directional difference rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer.

        about relative positions or equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that the Forrest Theatre is unlikely to be
        east of the Cathedral based on geographical reasoning about Philadelphia's
        location in southeastern PA. The NO is based on this directional reasoning
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its final comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Boone Lake being west of Beech Fork Lake), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Boone Lake would
        be south and possibly slightly west of Beech Fork Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Boone Lake is not east of Beech Fork Lake.
        The model provided reasoning and arrived at a clear negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on reasoning
        about relative geographic positions and the general layout of the states,
        suggesting Tennessee locations would typically not be east of West Virginia
        locations. The model actually indicates there could be slight variations in
        east-west positioning but bases its NO on broader geographic principles rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        it discusses limitations of making the determination without exact coordinates,
        it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about precise
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it concludes NO based on Tennessee being "generally to the west and south
        of West Virginia." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes some uncertainty about precise coordinates. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer based on general geographic principles, this
        counts as a definitive NO response rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests there is a north-south relationship and that
        the positions are likely different (though uncertain about exact east-west
        positioning). The NO is based on geographical reasoning about relative positions,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Hobe Sound is "likely west of Miami Beach." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explains that while both are on the east coast,
        the Bubble Houses are "not significantly east of the Raleigh Hotel" and are
        "more accurately described as being north of the Raleigh Hotel." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude/latitude values. Instead, it explains that Hobe Sound is north of
        Miami Beach, and this different positioning is the reason for its NO answer.
        While it mentions they are both on the Atlantic coast, it explicitly notes
        their different positions (one north of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it discusses potential differences in position, noting
        that one location would be south and possibly slightly east or west of the
        other. The NO answer is based on the reasoning about relative positions and
        state geography, not because the locations are at the same coordinates.

        relationship between the states and suggests that the shrine would likely
        not be east of the lake due to their relative positions. The model acknowledges
        uncertainty about exact coordinates but makes its determination based on typical
        geographical relationships, not equality.

        primarily on the north-south relationship between the states. Since the model
        notes possible differences and doesn't cite equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, this should be classified as False.

        the relative positions of New Jersey and New York, suggesting that the New
        Jersey location would likely not be east of the New York location due to their

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that South Coast Repertory is west of
        Calvary Church, indicating a directional difference. The NO is because one
        location is west of the other, not because they're at the same location.

        it suggests they are "not significantly east-west of each other" and are "relatively
        close," but this is not the same as stating they are exactly equal. The model's

        they could be "east, west, or in a similar longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning leading up to it indicates uncertainty ("it's not possible to
        definitively answer") and inability to determine the relative positions ("Without

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "in the same general area" but
        concludes NO based on the reasoning that South Coast Repertory is "likely
        not east" and might be "potentially west" of the other location. Since it
        implies a directional difference (even if in the opposite direction from what
        was asked), this is not a case of equal values.

        east of a California location due to their north-south relationship. The model
        specifically mentions possible slight east-west variations but bases its NO
        on other geographic principles rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact coordinates earlier
        in its reasoning. Since it provides this clear comparative answer rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it suggests they are "in close proximity" and "unlikely that
        the Gaiety Theatre is significantly east or west of the Comedy Theatre" but
        doesn't claim they're at exactly the same location. The model implies a slight
        but unclear relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria,
        regardless of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNCERTAIN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions due to

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a difference in position, specifically
        noting that Point Beach is likely "south (and possibly slightly west)" of
        Kewaunee. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. In fact, it suggests potential differences
        in position, noting that Kewaunee is "slightly further north" and possibly
        "slightly east" of Point Beach. The NO answer appears to be based on these
        potential differences rather than equality of positions.

        Plant is "south and slightly east of the Kewaunee Power Station," indicating
        a difference in position, even if slight. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this relative positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined
        without precise coordinates" and indicates it cannot make a definitive determination
        about the east-west relationship without more specific location data. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it suggests there are differences in their positions,
        noting that "Kewaunee Power Station is likely slightly west of the Point Beach
        Nuclear Plant." Even though it mentions the difference might not be significant,
        it still indicates a difference exists rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Point Beach Nuclear Plant is located east of Kewaunee Power
        Station.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they have similar longitudes"
        and are "generally in the same east-west orientation," but it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/identical as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model describes them as being on the same shoreline but focuses on their
        relative positions, with one being "slightly north" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    8d34bf76-4bbc-42cf-afe7-7e57f123a846:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations have a "similar
        east-west orientation" and are both on the eastern shore, it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in position. Instead, it suggests
        they are close but not identical, noting that one would need to be "significantly
        east" of the other to qualify as being "east of." Since the model's NO is
        based on this lack of significant difference rather than exact equality, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about the Bronx's position relative to other parts of NYC, suggesting it's
        unlikely for a Bronx location to be east of another NYC location. The model
        notes uncertainty but makes a directional judgment, not an equality-based
        one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested they
        were likely different but couldn't confirm with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "LIKELY YES" which is not
        a definitive YES answer. While it leans towards a positive response, the model
        expresses uncertainty and cannot make a definitive determination due to missing
        location information for the Christian Cultural Center. This type of qualified,
        uncertain response should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, suggesting that Arizona locations would typically
        be south and possibly slightly west of Utah locations. Since the NO is not
        based on equality of positions, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        to the general north-south positioning of the states. The model indicates
        there would likely be some directional difference, even if it can't specify
        exactly what it is.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since

        is likely west of Navajo Lake due to the general geographical relationship
        between Arizona and Utah. Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs east) rather than equality, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Blue Ridge Reservoir
        is north of Theodore Roosevelt Lake, explicitly stating "Since north is not
        east, Blue Ridge Reservoir is not east of Theodore Roosevelt Lake." The reason
        for NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about
        the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it suggests they are "not significantly
        separated" and "unlikely that Blue Ridge Reservoir is significantly east,"
        but these statements imply some difference exists, even if small. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the lack of significant eastern positioning rather
        than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. Instead,
        it based its NO answer on geographical reasoning about relative positions,
        indicating that San Luis Obispo County is "not significantly more easterly
        than Tuolumne County" but still implying some difference in position.

        that the locations were equal or identical in position. Instead, it described
        different positions (one being south of the other) and used this difference
        to conclude NO. The NO was based on relative positions being different, not
        on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about the eastern

        "not in a direct east-west alignment." The NO answer is based on their different
        positions, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this appears to be
        a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of specific location information. The model explicitly states "it's not possible

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with one location being west of the other (Brooklyn west of Manhattan). The
        NO answer is given because the premise asked if one was east and the model
        determined it was west instead.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        noting that Ohio is "slightly west" of Michigan and uses this as the basis
        for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station
        is "west and possibly slightly south" of Orchestra Hall, which indicates a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on the general geographic relationship between Ohio
        and Michigan, suggesting that Ohio locations would typically be west of Michigan
        locations. The model notes directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        there are differences in position, describing the nuclear station as being
        "south (and possibly slightly east or west)" of Orchestra Hall. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional relationship rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the analysis includes some uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that the north-south relationship between the
        states makes it unlikely for the Ohio location to be east of the Michigan
        location. The model indicates there would be some directional difference,
        just not the one asked about in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions and states it cannot determine the exact positions.
        The model suggests the locations have different positions (north-south relationship)
        but cannot precisely determine their east-west relationship without coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the final conclusion after the analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with the Drake Hotel being at 440 Park Avenue and north of 425
        Park Avenue. The NO answer is given because the Drake Hotel is described as
        being "north (and thus west)" rather than east as asked in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provides specific
        reasoning leading to this conclusion based on the relative positions of the

        different - one block apart (Drake Hotel at 440 Park Ave is one block north
        of 425 Park Ave). The NO is because they're on the same avenue (same east-west
        position) but different north-south positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical in position. Instead, it suggests they are "not significantly
        east or west of each other" and are "likely to be north, south, or in a similar
        general direction." This indicates a relative positioning rather than exact
        equality, and the NO is based on this relative positioning rather than exact
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it provides
        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN (cannot be determined
        without more specific location details)" as its final answer. Throughout the
        response, it emphasizes that it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of specific location information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine the
        answer without more specific information" and does not provide a clear YES/NO
        answer. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison.

        the same longitude or exactly equal in position. Instead, it indicates they
        are "relatively close" and in the "central part" of NC, but ultimately concludes
        NO based on its analysis of their positions, not because they are at identical
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states Lake Crabtree is northwest of the cathedral,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests there would likely be some directional difference ("south and
        possibly slightly east or west") and bases its NO answer on the general north-south
        relationship rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of their east/west positioning. Instead, it suggests
        there's uncertainty about their exact positions and bases its NO answer on
        the general north-south relationship between the states and the unlikelihood
        of the Wisconsin location being east of the Mississippi location. The model
        mentions possible slight east/west variations but never claims the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions and states it cannot determine exact positions. The
        model suggests the locations have different positions but cannot specify exactly
        how they differ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it suggests that the locations have different positions
        (north-south relationship) and states that without exact coordinates, it's
        "unlikely" that the MS location would be east of the WI location. The NO is
        based on geographical reasoning about relative positions, not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it explains that the states
        are aligned north-south and that any point in Wisconsin would be north "and
        possibly slightly east or west" of points in Mississippi. The NO is based
        on geographical relationships, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why the church is
        not east of the House on the Rock.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that Mississippi is "south and slightly west of Wisconsin." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, making a definitive comparative
        statement about the relative locations.

        positions and states it cannot determine the exact relationship without precise
        coordinates. The model suggests the relationship is primarily north-south
        rather than east-west, but does not base its NO answer on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        each other. The model notes uncertainty but does not claim the locations are
        at the same position or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

    b18aad03-75fc-4fef-8aa7-68951ac8b8be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and state geography, noting that Texas locations would typically
        not be east of Nebraska locations due to their north-south relationship. The
        model actually suggests there would be some difference in positions, just
        not in the direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the final conclusion after the analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it bases the NO answer on the general geographical relationship
        between the states and likelihood of relative positions. The model actually
        suggests there would be some difference in positions, discussing north-south
        relationships and possible slight east-west variations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about exact coordinates earlier
        in its reasoning. Since it provides this clear comparative answer without
        qualifying it as inability to determine, this counts as a definitive NO.

        east-west. The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of position.

        it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or that
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The response suggests uncertainty
        about exact positions rather than confirmed equality.

        Watson Pond is unlikely to be east of Boston Playwrights' Theatre because
        Boston is already on the eastern coast, meaning anything further east would
        be in the ocean.

        ("possibly slightly east or west") and bases its NO answer on the general
        north-south relationship between Maryland and Virginia. Since the model acknowledges
        potential differences rather than equality, this is not a case of equal values.

        geographic relationships between Virginia and Maryland, suggesting that the
        Virginia location would be more south than east of the Maryland location.
        The model notes that locations could be "slightly east or west" but doesn't
        claim they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        discusses limitations of making the determination without exact coordinates,
        it still provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        any discussion of relative positions in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that it cannot definitively determine
        the east-west relationship between the locations, stating it's "UNDECIDABLE"

        are at exactly the same longitude or are identical in position. Instead, it
        argues that the proximity makes it "misleading" to say one is east of the

        location. The model notes possible slight variations in east-west positioning,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        on the general geography and north-south relationship between the states,
        it's unlikely for the Mississippi location to be east of the Minnesota location.
        The model actually indicates there would likely be some difference in position,

        Mammy's Cupboard is "to the south and west of Lake Onalaska," indicating a
        difference in position. The NO is based on Mammy's Cupboard being west of
        (not east of) Lake Onalaska.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        of their relative positions, not because they are determined to be at exactly
        the same location. The model does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the
        same in position as the reason for its NO answer.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the explanation
        indicates it "cannot be determined with certainty." This is effectively stating
        "NO, I cannot determine" which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN. The model is
        not making a comparative determination but rather stating an inability to
        make the comparison.

        it indicates uncertainty about their relative positions and states it cannot
        determine their precise east-west relationship without specific addresses.
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it previously expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        on the reasoning that being in the same city means one cannot be east of the
        other, which is incorrect logic but not based on equality of position.

        never explicitly states they are at the same location or equal coordinates.
        Instead, it says it cannot determine their exact positions and bases its NO
        answer on the unlikelihood of significant east-west separation. Since equality
        is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified

        sufficient information to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c8e87511-84dd-4545-ae55-4fa66498ce03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison resulting in equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more specific location information. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "UNDETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot make the determination without more specific location
        information. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equality comparison
        is not relevant since we only evaluate it for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because Lake Mohawk
        is west of First African Baptist Church, noting that "Ohio is generally west
        of Georgia" and considering the specific locations. The model identified a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, providing a direct comparative
        answer to whether Lake Mohawk is east of First African Baptist Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the general geographic
        relationship between Ohio and Georgia, suggesting that a location in Ohio
        would not be east of a location in Georgia. The model notes directional differences,
        even while expressing some uncertainty about exact coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        positions, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or
        the same. Instead, it suggests that the Ohio location would likely not be
        east of the Georgia location due to the general north-south relationship between
        the states. The model actually indicates there could be slight east-west variations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning
        about relative positions and the general north-south relationship between
        Ohio and Georgia. The model actually suggests there would be some difference
        in position, noting that Ohio locations would be "north and possibly slightly
        east or west" of Georgia locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography
        principles."

    a17d96a3-0a7a-4930-ab73-9c1ef08babe8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason - that due to
        the north-south relationship between Ohio and Georgia, Lake Mohawk would not
        typically be described as east of the First African Baptist Church. The model
        actually suggests there would likely be some difference in position, even
        if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after providing reasoning about geographical positions. While it expresses
        some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does make a clear final comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions, stating that Ohio is generally northwest of Georgia and that it
        would be "unlikely" for the Ohio location to be east of the Georgia location.
        The model actually emphasizes differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO
        is stated definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography
        principles".

    d325f536-d4fe-412a-8ca4-918ff676f7d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Lake Mohawk is northwest of the church), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis determining that Lake
        Mohawk is northwest of the church, not east of it.'

    eaf11933-bc6c-45a1-a159-f5adab6f1d03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it suggests there are likely differences
        in position but cannot determine them precisely. The NO answer is based on
        the reasoning that Ohio locations would "not typically be described as east
        of" Georgia locations due to their north-south relationship, not because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO is stated
        definitively as the "most accurate answer based on general geography principles."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests that Lake Mohawk would be north and possibly
        slightly east or west of the church, and concludes NO based on the unlikelihood
        of an Ohio location being east of a Georgia location due to their north-south
        relationship. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning about the geographical positions of the locations.
        While it expresses some uncertainty about exact coordinates, it provides a
        definitive NO based on general geography principles.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly argues that there is a directional difference,
        with the California location being west of the Nevada location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        church is west of the dam, not because the locations are equal. It specifically
        states the church is "likely west" and "slightly west or southwest" of the
        dam, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of the other, implying some difference exists, even if small. The NO is based
        on reasoning about general geography rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses uncertainty about exact locations, it still provides a definitive

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Church of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel is "more eastward" than All Saints Church, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations of both churches.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the churches are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it indicates that both are somewhere between the rivers
        but cannot determine their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify the eastward relationship, not because of equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about the exact locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (not a "NO, I cannot determine"),
        this counts as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e53e0574-5101-4697-ab93-4c11bfd85e5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the churches
        being at the same location or having equal east/west positions. Rather, it
        determines that one church is south of the other, and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does note both are on
        the east side of Manhattan, but doesn't claim they're at the same east/west
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after analyzing the locations and determining that All Saints Church is
        south of, not east of, the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: UNKNOWN"
        and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without specific
        addresses or coordinates. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.'

    eb0732ac-325c-46e5-92f5-d0c927ffc359:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while both churches are on "East" streets,
        they have different addresses (230 East 60th Street vs 448 East 116th Street)
        and provides analysis about their relative positions. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing specific geographical analysis leading to this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or claimed the locations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        exact locations of the churches.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    eb8c6f31-3d83-4ef4-8f6a-713f6ffe43fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it indicated uncertainty
        about their exact positions and based its NO answer on the likelihood given
        Manhattan's layout. The NO was not due to the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa1fa979-c06a-4688-876e-47424c157bf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states the answer is "INCONCLUSIVE"
        and indicates it cannot definitively determine the east-west relationship
        without specific coordinates. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes with NO, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same position or equal in any way. Instead,
        it explicitly notes differences in their positions (VIA 57 West is further
        north than Playwrights Horizons) and bases its NO answer on their relative
        positions on the west side of Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or refusing
        to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0ed0eb8a-9346-4f78-b982-cd195c5a4a3f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both locations are on the
        western side of Manhattan, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it says "neither is significantly
        east or west of the other," which implies there might be some difference,
        even if minor. Since it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same, and equality isn't given as the primary reason for the NO answer, this
        doesn't qualify as a "same values" NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that both are
        on the west side of Manhattan but indicates they have different positions
        (one on West 42nd Street and one on West 57th Street). The NO answer is based
        on relative positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Playwrights Horizons is "more central"
        while VIA 57 West is "west of it" - indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer is based on this positional difference, not on equality.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        specific addresses or coordinates. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states that Playwrights Horizons
        is "west (and south) of VIA 57 West". The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        that the locations are at equal longitude. Instead, it indicates that AFI
        Silver is "north and possibly slightly east or west" of The Anthem. Since
        it mentions potential differences in position (even if slight), this does
        not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it suggests there are likely differences
        in position (noting north-south relationships and possible slight east-west
        variations), but concludes NO based on the unlikelihood of the eastern relationship
        being true, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and the unlikelihood of the eastern relationship, noting that Minnesota
        is primarily north of Texas. The model actually suggests there could be slight
        east/west differences but can't determine them precisely. Since equality is
        not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, after reasoning through the geographical relationships between Minnesota
        and Texas. While it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explained that the Rosary Cathedral
        is likely south or southeast of Triumph Church based on the general geography
        of Ohio and Michigan. The model suggests there are actual directional differences
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Rosary Cathedral is east of Triumph Church. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical in terms of their east/west positioning.
        In fact, it mentioned "possibly slightly east" several times in its analysis.
        The NO wasn't based on equal east/west positions, but rather seemed to be
        based on the overall geographical analysis focusing on north/south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether the Cathedral of St. Joseph is east of the Cathedral of
        Saints Peter and Paul. While the reasoning discusses north/south positions
        and mentions "possibly slightly east," the final answer is clearly stated

        possibly slightly east or west of the RI location, but that the north-south
        relationship makes it unlikely for the NH location to be considered "east"
        of the RI location. The NO answer is based on geographical reasoning about
        relative positions, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        west of Rhode Island" and that it would be "unlikely" for the NH location
        to be east of the RI location. The model notes directional differences rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        NO appears to be based on the reasoning that it's "unlikely that one would
        be significantly east of the other" rather than on them being in exactly the
        same location. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the
        NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Carlos Lake." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final

    d04cf782-467a-4dba-bbe9-64e4efb817dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests they are likely in different parts of California, with San Francisco
        being in the western part and San Andreas Lake likely being in the central
        or eastern part. The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer without qualifying it as inability to
        determine, this counts as a definitive NO response.

        or identical. In fact, it indicates there is a directional relationship between
        them, noting "While San Francisco is east of San Andreas Lake on a map." The
        NO answer is based on other reasoning about scale and typical usage of directional
        terms, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear comparative answer after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that the church is west of the lake. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that the church is not located east

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it's "not possible to
        conclusively determine" and gives an answer of "Uncertain" rather than a clear
        YES or NO. This indicates inability to make the comparison due to insufficient
        location data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it suggests they are "unlikely" to have "significant
        east-west differences" and notes they are both in Wisconsin, but this is not
        the same as stating they are at equal positions. The model's reasoning appears
        to be based on the lack of precise location data and assumptions about typical
        geographic relationships within a state, rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact locations earlier in its analysis, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it cannot determine the relationship ("it's not possible to definitively

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it reasons about relative positions and
        concludes NO based on the north-south relationship between the states and
        likely positioning. At no point does it suggest the locations are at the same
        longitude or otherwise equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the
        general geographical relationship between Wyoming and New Mexico, suggesting
        that Wyoming locations would typically not be east of New Mexico locations.
        The model actually suggests there would be some east-west difference, just
        not in the direction asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        geographic relationship between the states rather than on equality of position.
        The NO appears to be based on the complex north-south relationship rather
        than equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        and discussing their north-south relationship. The model notes differences
        in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Wyoming being west of New Mexico), not because the locations are equal. The

        and that the Mission Theater is "likely not located east of" the Keller Auditorium.
        This indicates a directional comparison rather than equality.

        answer appears to be based on the conclusion that one location is not significantly
        east of the other, rather than them being exactly equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it does not explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the same. The
        model's reasoning suggests uncertainty about their relative positions rather
        than equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNCERTAIN" and indicates
        it "cannot definitively say" whether one location is east of the other. This

        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined 9454 Wilshire
        Boulevard is in western Los Angeles County and is therefore unlikely to be
        east of Solar Star. The model notes relative positional differences, not equality.

        geography and relative positions, not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. While
        it mentions that "a definitive answer cannot be given," it still provides
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the answer is NO due to
        the north-south relationship between Oregon and California, and suggests that
        without exact coordinates, it's "unlikely" that the Oregon location would
        be east of the California location. The model notes potential differences
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Fort Peck Dam is west of Williams Fork Reservoir, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Fort Peck Dam is east of Williams Fork Reservoir.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines Fort Peck
        Dam is north (and possibly slightly east or west) of Williams Fork Reservoir,
        indicating a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, concluding that "Fort Peck Dam in Montana is west of Williams
        Fork Reservoir in Colorado." The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Fort Peck Dam is east of Williams Fork Reservoir,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        positions and states it's "unlikely" due to the north-south relationship between
        Montana and Colorado. The model actually suggests there would be some difference
        in positions, even if it can't specify exactly what that difference is.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in its reasoning. The NO

        in position" and "in the same general area," it never explicitly states they
        are exactly equal or identical in position. In fact, it indicates it cannot
        determine their exact relative positions. The NO appears to be based on inability
        to verify the eastward relationship rather than on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it previously expressed uncertainty about making the determination.
        Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify this
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, based on the instruction to analyze only what was
        explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same longitude or equally positioned east/west. Instead, it suggests they
        are unlikely to be "significantly" different in east/west positioning, but
        does not claim they are equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion
        that Griffy Lake is not east of Lake Monroe, not because they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While it expresses some

        and "not significantly east or west of each other," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in position. The model's reasoning
        suggests there might be small differences, just not significant ones. Since
        it doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model

        being at the same location or having equal positions. Instead, it states that
        Griffy Lake is north of Lake Monroe, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (being north rather than
        east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a definitive NO

        the model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the explanation
        indicates it cannot determine the relative positions ("without exact coordinates
        or a detailed map, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer"). This
        is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the criteria for

        locations would "not typically be described as east" of Texas locations due
        to their north-south relationship. The NO is not due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude/position. Instead, it indicates there are differences in
        position, concluding that DC is "likely to be west (and possibly slightly
        south)" of the Pennsylvania location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after its analysis, making a clear comparative directional statement.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equal position. Instead, it indicates there are differences
        in position, describing one location as "south and slightly east" relative
        to the other, and bases its NO answer on these relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the shrine is south (and possibly slightly east or west) of the lake, based
        on the geographical relationship between Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: **NO**"
        as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying the Cathedral is "north and slightly west of the reservoir." Even though
        this might be a small difference, any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, after explaining its reasoning about the

        automatically results in False according to the classification criteria. The
        model never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more specific location information for Rampart Reservoir.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer based on
        equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the determination due to
        insufficient location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it's impossible to definitively
        answer" and "it is not possible to determine definitively." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking specific location data for Rampart
        Reservoir.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNDETERMINED" and explains
        that it cannot determine the relative positions without knowing Rampart Reservoir's
        specific location. This indicates inability to make the comparison, which
        maps to UNKNOWN.
