        that Christ Church Cathedral is WEST of Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre,
        not east as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Georgia is generally
        to the east of Kentucky" and concludes that "Christ Church Cathedral in Lexington,
        Kentucky is WEST of Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Georgia, not east."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not claim the churches are in the same
        location or have equal values. Instead, it explicitly states that All Saints
        Church is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, indicating they are in different
        locations with one being more westerly than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Church of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel is further east than All Saints Church. The model determines
        that All Saints Church is 2-3 avenues east of 5th Avenue while the Church
        of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is 4-5 avenues east of 5th Avenue, indicating
        a clear difference in their east-west positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Church of Our Lady of Mount
        Carmel is further east than All Saints Church, indicating a difference in
        their east-west positions. The model states "Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
        is further east in Manhattan" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The answer is explicitly stated as "All Saints Church is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the churches are
        at different locations with different east-west positions. The model concluded
        NO because All Saints Church is west of (not east of) the Church of Our Lady
        of Mount Carmel, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its
        conclusion after analyzing the east-west positions of both churches. The model
        determined that All Saints Church is NOT located east of the Church of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel.

        model states "Our Lady of Mount Carmel (near Pleasant Avenue) is further east
        than All Saints Church (between 2nd and 3rd Avenues)." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        which is why it answers NO to whether New York City Center is east of Ziegfeld
        Theatre. The model clearly identifies a directional difference between the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that "the Ziegfeld Theatre

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes\
        \ (77.00\xB0 W vs 76.93\xB0 W) and states that the shrine is \"slightly west\"\
        \ of the lake. The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference,\
        \ not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "The Ukrainian Catholic National Shrine of the Holy
        Family in DC is NOT located east of Rose Valley Lake in Pennsylvania - it's
        actually slightly west of it." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.
