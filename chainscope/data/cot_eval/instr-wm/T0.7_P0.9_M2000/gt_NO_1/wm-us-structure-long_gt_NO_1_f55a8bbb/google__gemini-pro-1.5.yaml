    054e1e2e-1839-4453-9849-215909d2d75a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a clear directional difference, stating that
        Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is west of Sacred Heart Cathedral due to Pennsylvania
        being west of New York.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about geographical locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23228807-8a00-4209-b07c-ce6b89961c2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude values. Instead, it gave NO because it determined one location was
        west of the other (based on state-level geography), indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model made a definitive
        comparison based on state-level geography.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    484c27a4-0f78-4c76-b69c-33684ce49b01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        indicating that Centre County (where the reservoir is) is "definitively west
        of Rochester, NY." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is not
        east of Sacred Heart Cathedral. The model provided reasoning based on geographical
        positions and came to a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c878e0e-7daf-44c9-9a5a-4c1596d02e63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Pennsylvania
        is west of New York and therefore something in central PA would be west of
        something in western NY. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    848f8ce8-9b68-41d0-821c-4c566de80a1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on Pennsylvania being west of
        New York, indicating a difference in position. Even though this was a general
        geographic comparison, it still indicates a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    d2688b27-1dd9-45bb-9e75-84e952017ca3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (the reservoir is west of the cathedral). The NO appears to be rejecting that
        one is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that the reservoir is west, not east, of the
        cathedral.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d4711e71-bfe4-4cfb-8e31-d56e7f1bb37b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same coordinates. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that one location
        is west of the other (Pennsylvania being west of New York). The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        steps and gave a definitive answer without expressing uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    dc1d6060-446e-40a6-840f-f23f02c4b62d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it lays out reasoning about relative
        positions of Pennsylvania and New York, and then concludes NO. The NO appears
        to be based on disagreeing with the west comparison, not because the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fd57ba4d-b689-4e7d-89f1-9f3ee67d6ceb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the reservoir
        is west of the cathedral (based on Pennsylvania being generally west of New
        York). Since the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than
        equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the reservoir is east of the cathedral, making a clear comparative
        judgment based on relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same - it actually stated there is a directional difference, specifically
        that the Hollywood Sign is west of the First AME Church. The NO appears to
        disagree with some unstated premise rather than indicate equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining their relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Hollywood Sign is west of the church), and this directional difference appears
        to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing directional analysis concluding that the Hollywood Sign is
        west of the FAME Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually describes a clear directional difference,
        stating that "the Hollywood Sign is west of the First African Methodist Episcopal
        Church" in its reasoning, making this a NO based on a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it lays out their relative positions (Hollywood Sign
        in Hollywood Hills, First AME Church in downtown LA, and notes that Hollywood
        is west of downtown), indicating different locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the relative locations. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Youngstown
        is west of Claytor Dam, not because the locations have equal longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Ohio is generally
        west of Virginia" and "Youngstown is west of Claytor Dam"), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Youngstown, while in eastern Ohio,
        would still be west of southwestern Virginia, indicating a difference in position
        (even if slight). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly stated that one theater was
        west of the other, indicating a difference in location based on their street
        addresses (W vs E). The NO was given because the relationship was opposite
        to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Miller High Life Theatre is west, not east, of Milwaukee Repertory Theater.

        there is a difference in location ("slightly west"), not that the locations
        are equal. The NO is based on Miller High Life Theatre being west rather than
        east of the comparison point.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Miller High Life Theatre is slightly west of Milwaukee
        Repertory Theater (not east as asked in the question)

        (stating that Copper Mountain is east of Brock Reservoir), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear comparative
        result indicating Brock Reservoir is not east of Copper Mountain.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that northeastern California is "significantly west" of southern Nevada and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Brock Reservoir cannot be east of Copper
        Mountain because California is west of Nevada.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because California is
        west of Nevada, making it impossible for a California location to be east
        of a Nevada location. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the geographical locations and state boundaries.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the locations have different positions (Copper Mountain is east of Brock Reservoir),
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Brock Reservoir is east of Copper Mountain Solar Facility,
        after determining that Copper Mountain is actually east of Brock Reservoir.

    fed8d02f-d56c-4f64-b0f8-422ae89d753a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        something in California cannot be east of something in Nevada because California
        is west of Nevada.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly determined that Kentucky is "generally
        west of Florida" and concluded that Alice Lloyd College is "west of" the Cathedral,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be incorrect
        given the reasoning provided, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not
        its logical consistency.

        (McCallum being east of Morena), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is a clear comparative result
        indicating Morena Dam is not east of McCallum Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        area (Morena Dam). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response to whether Morena Dam is east of McCallum
        Theatre. The answer is explicit and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (saying that since Beech
        Fork Lake is west of Boone Lake, Boone Lake cannot be east of Beech Fork Lake
        - which appears to be a logical error, but we're instructed to take the model's

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Schoharie
        Reservoir is west of Lake Surprise, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Schoharie
        Reservoir is *west* of Lake Surprise")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Schoharie Reservoir is west of Lake Surprise (when asked

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Schoharie Reservoir is west
        of Lake Surprise, NJ." The NO answer appears to be based on finding a directional
        difference (being west of), not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis. This is an explicit NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the theaters
        were at the same location or longitude. Rather, it determined that Gaiety
        Theatre was NORTH of the Comedy Theatre, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO was due to a different directional relationship, not because of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations of the theaters and determining that
        Gaiety Theatre is north of, rather than east of, the Comedy Theatre.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't perform these
        steps and provide a definitive YES/NO answer" because it lacks access to the
        necessary location information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer this question" and indicates it needs more information. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Gaiety Theatre is "further west" than the Comedy Theatre, not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

        building." The NO answer is explicitly based on the fact that they are identical/the
        same building, with the model stating "something cannot be east of itself."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear NO response based
        on its reasoning that the buildings are actually the same building.

    4d9cb3c9-d653-4ee2-bba3-180146cdec38:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states these are "the same building"
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since they
        are the same building, one cannot be east of the other").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that
        they are the same building.

      result: UNKNOWN
    75318ffe-cc1d-4089-98dc-467957e507e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined the Blackstone Hotel was
        south of (not east of) the Flatiron Building based on address numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    a65f83db-a933-4464-9955-8426c473747b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "The Blackstone Hotel is slightly
        west of the Flatiron Building" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        buildings being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that the Blackstone Hotel is slightly west of the
        Flatiron Building, making this a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a893e466-8e90-478d-84c3-0a64040135ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that the Blackstone
        Hotel is "further west" than the Flatiron Building, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be responding to whether one building
        was east of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. It makes a definitive statement about the relative positions, saying
        the Blackstone Hotel is "further west" than the Flatiron Building.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the Blackstone Hotel and Flatiron
        Building are "the same building" and concludes "something cannot be east of
        itself." This equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the two buildings are actually the same building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    b62975d4-1c63-4e21-90ca-69bf302ba0fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it determined one building doesn't
        exist in the specified location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot accurately determine
        the relative locations" and "I cannot answer YES or NO" because one of the
        buildings (Flatiron Building) doesn't exist in Fort Worth. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    cd5c3d07-efdd-41b2-94bd-a461dc93d9d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Blackstone Hotel is west of the Flatiron Building, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("*west*
        of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Blackstone Hotel is west (not east) of the Flatiron
        Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f86ff291-cf26-41b5-a72f-89b1e666a8ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "the Blackstone Hotel is
        west of the Flatiron Building." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines that one location is south of the other
        rather than east, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographic reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion through reasoning about
        relative positions, indicating that Oklahoma City is likely west of Lewis
        and Clark Lake, which appears to contradict its NO answer. While there may
        be inconsistency between the reasoning and conclusion, we must take the explicit
        NO at face value without trying to resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it laid out a geographical reasoning that led to its NO conclusion. The model
        actually suggested a relative positioning (Oklahoma being west of Nebraska)
        but still concluded NO for unstated reasons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

    3ecff668-2cad-445c-b817-a907c665e25b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined relative positions (stating Oklahoma is
        "south and west" of the Dakotas/Nebraska) and concluded that Civic Center
        Music Hall is "west" of Lewis and Clark Lake. The NO answer appears to be
        based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that one location
        is west of the other (indicating a difference in position), not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct negative response based on
        its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions or that equality was the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it laid out geographical relationships and concluded NO, presumably because
        its reasoning led to a different relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, explaining that Oklahoma (where Civic Center Music Hall is) is
        south of South Dakota/Nebraska (where Lewis and Clark Lake is), and provides
        directional reasoning about west/east positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Washington is west of California,
        indicating a difference in longitude. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though this reasoning may be geographically questionable, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the locations were at equal longitude. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference, saying western Washington is "significantly west" of the
        San Francisco Bay area. The NO answer wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Lake Steilacoom

        Lake Steilacoom would be west of Terrapin Crossroads because "Washington state
        is north of California, and therefore further west." Even though this reasoning
        is geographically incorrect, the model clearly indicated a difference in position

        significantly west of coastal California" and concludes that Lake Steilacoom
        is west of Terrapin Crossroads. The NO answer appears to be because the premise
        (east of) is opposite to the actual relationship (west of) it found.

        location (440) was "further north" than the other (425), and they were "not
        significantly east or west" of each other. The presence of any difference,
        even if described as minimal, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that St. Ambrose
        Cathedral is "slightly west" of the Civic Center, indicating a difference
        in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result based on relative positions (stating
        the Cathedral is west, not east, of the Civic Center)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it's based on the reasoning that Texas
        is west of Nebraska, making it impossible for the Texas location to be east
        of the Nebraska location. The model indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Texas is west of Nebraska and therefore anything in Texas will be west
        of anything in Nebraska.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Texas panhandle is "significantly east
        of western Nebraska", indicating a clear difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out geographical facts about the locations.

    b975ac08-c1eb-473e-9a0f-7461e680a4dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through the relative positions and concluded
        that Amarillo is west of Lake McConaughy (step 5), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must
        evaluate only what was explicitly stated about equality, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined their relative positions (Kentucky being west of Georgia)
        and gave NO as the answer. The model did not cite equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        "Kentucky is generally west of Georgia" and concluding "Laurel River Lake,
        KY is west of Victory World Church, GA" before giving its NO answer. While
        this seems contradictory with the NO answer, we must take the NO at face value
        while noting that equality was not given as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a directional difference (Laurel River Lake is west of Victory World Church),
        not because the locations were at the same longitude. The model explicitly
        stated a difference in position rather than equality.

        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Carver is south of Boston "with a slight eastward component." Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference, concluding
        that anything in Arizona is west of anything in Utah. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated that Bartlett Lake is "significantly
        west" of Causey Reservoir, and this difference in position was the reason
        for the NO answer.

        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Bartlett Lake is west of Causey Reservoir due to Arizona being
        west of Utah. The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we
        must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        with slight differences in position ("might be on different streets, with
        one having a slightly more easterly address"). The NO answer appears to be
        based on the inability to make a meaningful east/west comparison at the city
        scale, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that the buildings cannot be meaningfully compared
        in terms of east/west position since they are in the same city.

        to each other, it ultimately identifies a directional difference (Eureka Inn
        being "slightly northeast" of Carson Mansion). Any directional difference,
        even if described as "slight," means the locations are not exactly the same,
        so this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on finding that one
        location is "slightly northeast" of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d20b9940-0810-495e-8bf2-a8513dff3eee:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "neither is east or west of
        the other" because they are "in the same city," implying they are in the same
        location/position. This equality (being in the same place) is given as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    efd5a790-39e1-44e0-a5ff-da8f5f21e010:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both locations are in the same
        city, it does not explicitly state they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates. Instead, it suggests that the answer is NO because the distances
        are too small to be significant, while acknowledging they could technically
        have different positions. This is not a case of equal values being the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it adds a parenthetical note about technical possibility. Since
        it gives a clear NO answer to the comparative question, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        locations (Mamaroneck on mainland vs Glenwood Landing on Long Island) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d3b5ad1-a721-419a-a54e-ed9506c4c37c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in the values (-73.7286 vs -73.7119) and concluded the church was west of
        the power station based on this difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its logic through to a definitive
        "NO" answer based on comparing the longitude values, where it found the church
        (-73.7286) to be west of the power station (-73.7119)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db7590bd-179c-4855-a9f3-088f13b08eff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (-73.7287 vs -73.713) and uses
        this difference to conclude that the church is west, not east, of the power
        station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the comparison of longitudes between the
        two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    edeed533-5ad4-4685-bfb4-dcc470d2fa76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (-73.729085 vs -73.935444) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Most Holy Trinity Church is east of Glenwood
        Generating Station.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f57f733f-ccc3-4979-8c7e-8b0a559a0195:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found different
        longitude values (-73.7188 vs -73.7267) and explicitly states that Glenwood
        is east of the church. The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a detected
        difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that Glenwood Generating Station
        is east of Most Holy Trinity Church (not west of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in East
        Harlem is further east than All Saints Church in the Lower East Side.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that All
        Saints is "much further west" than Our Lady of Mount Carmel - indicating a
        clear difference in position, not equality. The model does not state or suggest
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that All Saints
        is "much further west, not east" than Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

    1cd5abe8-93a5-43c8-8ee9-75f84e8fa3d2:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model concludes NO because it determines the churches
        are aligned on the East-West axis, effectively stating they are at the same
        East-West position ("neither is East or West of the other"). This equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that neither church is East or West of the other since they appear to be aligned
        on the East-West axis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found All Saints
        Church is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly stated there was a directional difference ("Amsterdam
        Avenue (West Side) is west of East 28th Street").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two churches, determining that
        All Saints Church is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "East 80th Street is significantly west
        of East 115th Street." The NO answer was based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6af618cf-0dae-422e-a0b6-980668bc5d4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one church is on the West Side
        while the other is on the East Side, indicating a clear difference in position
        ("Amsterdam Avenue is on the West Side and East 115th Street is on the East
        Side. Therefore, All Saints is West of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east/west positions of the two churches,
        finding that All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because All Saints
        is "west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel", indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not because they are at the same location or coordinates
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that All Saints Church is "further
        downtown and west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel"
      final_answer: 'NO'

    75cd67d0-d652-46ab-ac5c-0050d2ee85ff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one church is on the West Side and the
        other is on the East Side, indicating a clear difference in position. The
        NO answer is given because All Saints is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the east-west positions of the two churches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that All Saints is west of Our
        Lady of Mount Carmel, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that All Saints
        is west of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.

    df451f87-aaa4-4742-a932-491c781a378c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because All Saints is "directly
        west of" Our Lady of Mount Carmel, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO is not based on the locations being equal/same/identical,
        but rather on one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, assuming the
        question refers to the Bronx church, the answer is NO". While there is some
        uncertainty about which church is being referenced, the model does provide
        a clear NO answer based on its assumption about which church is meant.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explained that VIA 57 West is actually
        north of Playwrights Horizons, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that VIA 57 West is north
        of Playwrights Horizons, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their locations (42nd vs 57th
        Street) and concluded one was east of the other. The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself doesn't make
        sense because streets run East-West, so one street cannot be east of another
        street. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that Minnesota is "significantly west of Texas" and
        uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are clearly stated as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Minnesota is west of Texas), not because the locations are at the
        same position. Since it indicates a difference in position rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Minnesota is "generally west
        of Texas" and therefore the first location is NOT east of the second. The
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal/same. Instead, it stated that Minnesota is "north and west of Texas"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        further east" than Pat Mayse Lake, implying there is some positional difference.
        Since equality is not stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.

        Instead, it made a directional comparison, stating that Oologah Lake is "likely
        west of" Pat Mayse Lake. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        given, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather than
        resolve contradictions.

        Oologah Lake is "likely west of" Pat Mayse Lake, and gave this as the basis
        for its NO answer. Even though its reasoning seems contradictory (saying it's
        west but answering NO), we must take the response at face value and note that
        equality was not given as the reason for the NO.

        that St. Paul's would be "generally north, or slightly northeast" of the lake.
        This directional difference, even if slight, means the NO answer was not due
        to equal values.

    4593cdb3-5d83-479f-b2b6-65b6e266cdf3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference in the longitudes (-88.13 vs -88.40)
        and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values being
        compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the longitudes of both locations. This was a clear,
        direct NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly stated different longitude values (-88.40 vs -88.13)
        and concluded that one location is west of the other based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that 222 Building is west of
        Elmbrook Church.

    5c83504b-58da-41ce-ba69-7b774653b4c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Appleton
        is significantly northwest of Brookfield," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 222 Building is not east of Elmbrook Church.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values\
        \ are equal. It explicitly stated different longitude values (-88.40\xB0 vs\
        \ -88.14\xB0) and concluded NO because 222 Building is west of Elmbrook Church\
        \ based on these different values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison process
        and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning
        showing 222 Building is west of Elmbrook Church based on longitude values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly stated that the longitudes are different (-88.5208
        vs -88.1381) and that "Elmbrook Church has a higher (less negative) longitude."
        The NO was based on finding different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining that Elmbrook Church has a higher longitude
        value than 222 Building.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different longitude values
        (-88.4065 vs -88.1169) and concluded NO because 222 Building was west of Elmbrook
        Church, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        comparing the longitudes and explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final answer,
        based on finding that the 222 Building is west (not east) of Elmbrook Church.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-88.4 vs -88.1) and explicitly states that 222 Building
        is west of Elmbrook Church. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that 222 Building is west of

    4ccfdef5-7a96-4e4b-ae6e-437473eea535:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, saying Steppenwolf
        Theatre is "further north and slightly west" of Presidential Towers. Even
        though both are in Chicago, the model identifies specific positional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Steppenwolf Theatre
        is "further north and slightly west" of Presidential Towers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Although the model notes they are "very close" and
        have the same approximate coordinates (-87.65), it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference ("slightly west"). Any stated difference, even
        if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        states "The Basilica appears to be slightly east, though the difference is
        negligible." Any stated difference, even if described as slight or negligible,
        means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and maintains this
        as its final answer, providing it as a direct comparative result. While it
        notes some uncertainty, it definitively gives NO as its answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference, concluding
        that Fourmile Lake would be west of the church. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO
        response.

    984202bf-7638-4ad8-8de0-f04ff90e2840:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model actually states that Oregon
        is west of California, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was given because one location is west of the other, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its reasoning that Oregon is west of California, therefore
        Fourmile Lake cannot be east of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af506745-18b8-419c-a8c9-17e1bc492cb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference as its reasoning, stating
        that "Oregon is generally west of California" and therefore "Fourmile Lake,
        OR is west of Our Lady of the Wayside Church, CA". The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ec30ea3e-358c-4010-94a7-614461db2389:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it made a geographical reasoning that led to its
        NO answer, suggesting Oregon is west of California. The NO wasn't based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a straightforward rejection of
        the comparison statement (that Fourmile Lake is west of the church), not a
        refusal or inability to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        It explicitly states that Beverly is "west of Cleveland" and concludes the
        power plant is "west, not east" of the theatre.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about the relative positions

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning about relative positions
        (with Denver being north and slightly east of Colorado Springs, and the reservoir
        being west of Colorado Springs) to reach its NO conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Rampart Reservoir, being west of Colorado
        Springs, would be "considerably west of Denver" where the Cathedral is located.
        The NO answer is based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b0e29ef5-5cdc-4c63-a145-b453de419b40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it determines NO based on finding that one location
        is west of the other (the reservoir is west of Colorado Springs which is west
        of Denver where the cathedral is). Since it identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative locations step
        by step.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined NO based on finding that one location
        was east of the other (specifically that the Cathedral was east of the reservoir).
        Since the NO was based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after working through the relative positions
        step by step.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations of the Cathedral Basilica
        and Rampart Reservoir.

      result: 'YES'
    e0d647a3-0622-44c3-acfc-db43900bcd14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while the Cathedral is
        northeast of the reservoir (which includes an easterly component), it's not
        strictly east of it. The model identifies a directional difference (northeast
        vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question, based on its reasoning that while the Cathedral is northeast of
        the reservoir, it's not strictly east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f2ebf4dd-4b35-47d7-8955-b95a30cec72d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it determines NO based on relative positions, indicating Rampart
        Reservoir is "significantly west and slightly south" relative to Denver (where
        the Cathedral is)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT east of" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions
