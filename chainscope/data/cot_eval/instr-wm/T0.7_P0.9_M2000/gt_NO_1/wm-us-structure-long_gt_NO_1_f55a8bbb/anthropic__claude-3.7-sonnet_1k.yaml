        Theater is on the east side. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clarifying that "Miller High Life Theatre is located west, not east,
        of Milwaukee Repertory Theater." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        on 16th Street NW, they are aligned on the same north-south axis" and "Neither
        is significantly east or west of the other." The model is saying the churches
        are at the same longitude (on the same north-south axis), which is why one
        is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        churches are located along the same north-south street (16th Street NW), meaning
        they are at essentially the same longitude or east-west position. The model
        explicitly states "they are at essentially the same longitude (east-west position)"
        and "they are both located along the same north-south street (16th Street
        NW)." This indicates the values being compared (east-west positions) are the
        same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Charles E. Nelson House
        "must be west of Camanche Reservoir, not east" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is stating there is a difference
        in position (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Charles E. Nelson House, OR is not located east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the geographical
        positioning makes it impossible for the Oregon location to be east of the
        California location. The model argues that Camanche Reservoir is not far enough
        west in California for any Oregon location to be east of it, implying a difference
        in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model is clearly making a comparative judgment
        that Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is not east of Camanche Reservoir in
        California.

        The model is indicating a directional difference (north-south relationship
        rather than east-west equality), not equality of longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the very end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Charles E. Nelson House in Oregon is east of Camanche
        Reservoir in California.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Oregon as a state is primarily
        west and north of Camanche Reservoir's location in California (and not east
        of it)," indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The model
        is saying NO because it believes Charles E. Nelson House is west/north of
        the reservoir, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Charles E. Nelson House, OR is not located east
        of Camanche Reservoir, CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        the same or equal east-west positioning. Instead, it indicates that it cannot
        determine their east-west relationship with certainty due to lack of precise
        coordinates. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        to make the comparison, not because the locations are at the same longitude
        or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of whether
        Charles E. Nelson House is east of Camanche Reservoir.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Charles E. Nelson House
        would be north of Camanche Reservoir, but not east of it. The model is making
        a directional distinction, not claiming the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer to whether Charles E. Nelson House, OR is located
        east of Camanche Reservoir, CA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or identical longitudes. Instead, it suggests that Charles E. Nelson
        House would "still likely be west of or aligned with Camanche Reservoir, not
        east of it." The model is indicating a difference in position (west of) or
        potential alignment, but not equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Charles E. Nelson House, OR is not located east
        of Camanche Reservoir, CA. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that the house would be "north/northwest of the reservoir" rather
        than east. The model is indicating a difference in direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - the Charles E. Nelson
        House in Oregon is not east of Camanche Reservoir in California." This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

        of (or approximately at the same longitude as) Schoharie Reservoir." The mention
        of Lake Surprise being "slightly east" indicates a difference in values, even
        if small, which means the model is not claiming equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Schoharie Reservoir
        is not east of Lake Surprise." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the question "Is First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa), OK located east of
        Lac qui Parle, MN?" The model concludes that Tulsa is slightly east of Lac
        qui Parle based on their respective longitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions they have
        "similar or slightly lower numbers" and are "approximately at the same longitude,"
        it ultimately concludes that "First Presbyterian Church (Tulsa), OK is NOT
        located east of Lac qui Parle, MN. It is either west of or approximately at
        the same longitude as Lac qui Parle." This indicates the model believes Tulsa
        is either west of or possibly at the same longitude, but not definitively
        equal, and it presents multiple possibilities rather than equality as the
        sole reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK is east of Lac qui Parle,
        MN. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

        in their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, First Presbyterian Church
        in Tulsa, OK is NOT located east of Lac qui Parle, MN. It is located west
        of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        qui Parle" indicating a difference in position, even if small. The model notes
        that they are "quite close in longitude" but specifically identifies a directional
        difference (Tulsa being slightly west), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa, OK is not east of Lac

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Davis-Besse is west
        of Orchestra Hall, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Davis-Besse is west (not east) of Orchestra
        Hall, not because they are at the same location or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station is east of Orchestra Hall in
        Detroit. The model explicitly concludes "Davis-Besse is west of Orchestra
        Hall in Detroit, not east" and then gives a definitive "NO" as the final answer.

        same north-south avenue (Park Avenue), but it specifically notes they are
        at different positions (Drake Hotel is north of 425 Park Avenue). The model's
        reasoning is that being on the same avenue means they have the same east-west
        position, not that they are equal in all respects.

        of Park Avenue and "neither would be significantly east of the other" and
        "the Drake Hotel is not meaningfully east of 425 Park Avenue." This suggests
        they are aligned similarly but not exactly equal, and the model is saying
        NO because the Drake Hotel is not east of 425 Park Avenue, not because they
        are in the exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Southampton is
        further east than East Haddam" which indicates a difference in the east-west
        positions. The model is saying NO because Southampton is further east than
        Goodspeed Musicals, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Goodspeed Musicals in
        Connecticut is NOT located east of the Basilica of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus
        and Mary in Southampton, New York." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that "Providence,
        RI is further east than Manchester, NH" and that "the Cathedral of Saints
        Peter and Paul (in Providence) is east of the Cathedral of St. Joseph (in
        Manchester)." The model is indicating a difference in position (Providence
        is east of Manchester), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of
        its response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Manchester is located east of the Cathedral
        of Saints Peter and Paul in Providence.

        east than Manchester" and "the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Providence
        would be east of the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Manchester." The model is
        saying NO because it believes one location is east of the other, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        to the question "Is Cathedral of St. Joseph (Manchester, New Hampshire), NH

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Cathedral of Saints Peter
        and Paul in Providence is east of the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Manchester,
        indicating a directional difference. The model says "NO" because the direction
        is reversed from what was asked, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Cathedral of St. Joseph in Manchester is NOT

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that both buildings are located
        on the same north-south avenue (N Orange Ave) and are "aligned along the same
        general north-south axis." This indicates the model is saying NO because the
        buildings are essentially at the same longitude or east-west position. The
        model states "they don't have a clear east-west relationship" and "Neither
        building is significantly east or west of the other," indicating they are
        in the same east-west position.

        buildings have "approximately the same east-west positioning" and are "essentially
        aligned on the same north-south axis" with "similar east-west coordinates."
        The model is stating that the buildings have equal east-west positions, and
        this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that the buildings are aligned on the same north-south street (Orange Avenue)
        and "have essentially the same east-west position." The model explicitly states
        they "cannot be east or west of each other in any meaningful way - they're
        on the same north-south axis." This indicates the model is saying the east-west
        positions are the same/equal, and this equality is the primary reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that "neither is east or west of
        the other - they are aligned on the same north-south axis." This is stating
        that the east-west values are the same (they are aligned on the same axis),
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model
        specifically states they are on the same north-south street and neither is
        east or west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Orange County Courthouse is located east of St. James Cathedral.

        aligned on the east-west axis since they're on the same avenue" and that "neither
        is significantly east or west of the other." The model is saying NO because
        the buildings are essentially at the same east-west position, with only "minimal"
        differences in exact placement. This indicates the values being compared (east-west
        positions) are effectively the same, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        the same east-west positioning" and are "essentially on the same north-south
        line." This indicates the model is saying NO because the buildings have equal
        east-west positioning, not because one is west of the other.
