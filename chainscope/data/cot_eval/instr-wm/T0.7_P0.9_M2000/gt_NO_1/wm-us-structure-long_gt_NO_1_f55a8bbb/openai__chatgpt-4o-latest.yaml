        of the locations, concluding that the Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir is likely
        west of Rochester (Sacred Heart Cathedral). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided (which suggests the reservoir is west), but nowhere
        does the model claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same
        position.

        contains a contradiction (first saying Rochester is further west, then concluding
        Pennsylvania is west of Rochester), but I'm not resolving this inconsistency

        that Third Avenue is west of Fourth Avenue in San Diego's street layout, making
        the Civic Theatre west of the Balboa Theatre. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

        and explaining that "South Coast Repertory is located closer to the coast"
        while "Calvary Church of Santa Ana is further inland, meaning it is more to

        model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations, not
        equality.

        NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.

        indicates the locations are different (one is west of the other), not equal,
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that South Coast Repertory is west of Calvary Church (not east). In Step 3,
        it explicitly states "SCR must be west of Calvary Church" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model identified a directional difference between the locations,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a difference in location,
        stating "the Gaiety Theatre is west of the Comedy Theatre." The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question asking if one theater is east of the
        other (though the original question isn't provided), not because the locations
        are identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "the Gaiety Theatre is west of the Comedy Theatre." The model is indicating
        a specific spatial relationship where one theater is west of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Gaiety Theatre
        is west of the Comedy Theatre" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference,
        stating "the Gaiety Theatre is west of the Comedy Theatre" in its analysis.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Gaiety Theatre
        is not east of the Comedy Theatre" as its final answer. This is a clear negative

        east-west positions are very close" and that the plants are "mostly aligned
        north-south rather than east-west." The model concludes that Point Beach is
        north of Kewaunee, not significantly to the east or west. This indicates a
        directional difference (north-south alignment) rather than equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.

        This indicates a very small difference might exist, not perfect equality.
        The model is describing a relative positioning rather than stating they are

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "neither is significantly
        farther east or west than the other" and "neither is meaningfully 'east' of
        the other." This indicates a lack of meaningful difference rather than exact
        equality, and the model's reasoning focuses on their similar positioning on
        the same shoreline rather than stating they have identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        of the other in this context" - suggesting the comparison itself doesn't apply
        rather than stating the values are equal.

        - it states that Point Beach is farther north while Kewaunee is farther south
        along the same shoreline, and concludes that "Point Beach is not east of Kewaunee."
        The model is making a directional comparison rather than claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Actors Theatre of Louisville
        is west of The Green Building (not east), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Actors Theatre of
        Louisville is not located east of The Green Building" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model explicitly
        determined that the locations are in different positions - one is on West
        Main Street and the other is on East Market Street. The model concluded that
        "Actors Theatre of Louisville is west of The Green Building" before giving
        its contradictory "NO" answer. Since the model did not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO", which is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response. However, this appears to be inconsistent
        with the model's own reasoning and conclusion. The model concluded "Actors
        Theatre of Louisville is west of The Green Building" but then gave a final
        answer of "NO". Despite this contradiction, I must evaluate based on what
        was explicitly stated as the final answer.
