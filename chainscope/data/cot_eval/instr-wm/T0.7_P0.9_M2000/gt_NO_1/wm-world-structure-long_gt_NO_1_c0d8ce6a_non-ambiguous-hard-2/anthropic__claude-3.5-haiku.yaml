      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Dublin is west of Norway" and "the Church of the Immaculate Conception is
        west of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the directional finding, but the model is not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same - it actually
        stated they are in different countries and that it cannot determine their
        east/west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "So I will say: NO (with
        the caveat that this is based on the impossibility of a clear east/west positioning
        between churches in different countries)". While the model expresses uncertainty
        about making the comparison, it explicitly chooses "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies that this is due to the impossibility of determining the positioning
        rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is essentially saying it cannot determine
        the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "I do not have enough information to
        determine this with certainty." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the relationship), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" as
        its final answer. It acknowledges that it lacks precise coordinate information
        to make a definitive east/west comparison between the two churches. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Church of the Immaculate

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED
        ("I do not know"), this question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        of whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather acknowledges
        that it lacks the information needed to make the comparison. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the locations are in different countries and cities, and that
        "the concept of 'east of' doesn't make sense in this context." The NO answer
        is based on the geographical impossibility of the comparison, not on equality
        of values.

        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says the question

        because the locations are in "completely different countries and cities" and
        that "there's no geographical relationship" that would allow for an east/west
        determination. The reason for the NO is not that the locations have equal

        relationship is the opposite of what was asked - the dam is east of the church,
        not the church east of the dam.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it couldn't determine the relationship
        without precise coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the explanation leading to this answer
        indicates the model cannot determine the east-west relationship with certainty
        due to lack of precise coordinates. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies in parentheses that the reason for this answer
        is "Because I cannot confirm with certainty that the Government Complex is

        determination but rather expressing inability to verify the comparison due

        The primary reason for the NO answer appears to be that North Shore Music
        Theatre is not east of City Thameslink station, not that they are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        completely different countries (Singapore and Philippines) and that they "cannot
        have a simple east/west relationship relative to each other." The model's
        reasoning is that the comparison is not possible in the terms requested, not
        that the values are equal.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that this NO is "not based on certain knowledge,
        but on the inability to confirm a YES" and that it "cannot confidently determine
        whether Churston Court is east of Chaira Hydro Power Plant" due to lack of
        information. This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot verify
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the east-west relationship
        between the two locations because it doesn't know their precise geographical
        positions. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it would need more information
        to determine the east-west relationship between the locations. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer to this question" and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." The
        model indicates it lacks the necessary geographical information to make the
        comparison, which means it's unable to determine the answer rather than refusing
        to answer on principle.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm the east/west positioning)" which indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative judgment, so the final
        answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot
        confidently confirm their precise relative positions" and cites "lack of definitive
        geographic information" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is not
        claiming the locations are identical or equal; it's stating it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it lacks definitive geographic information to make
        the comparison, it still provides a clear "NO" as its conclusion rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final determination.

        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot make the determination due to
        lack of information. The model explains "I cannot confidently state it is
        east of Gary Junction Road without more specific geographical data." This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making
        a comparative judgment.

        asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        their relative positioning. The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the very end of

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I do not have sufficient
        information to confidently say YES)". This is a case where the model is using
        NO to indicate it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information,
        not as a comparative result. The model explicitly says "I do not have enough

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the relative positioning
        due to lack of information. The model explains "I cannot confirm the east/west
        positioning without more specific location details." This is a case where
        the model is saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are
        in different countries and continents and "cannot have a simple east/west
        relationship." The model indicates that it "cannot confidently say YES or
        NO" due to the complexity of comparing locations on different continents,
        not because they are equal or the same. The reason for the NO is that the
        comparison is difficult to make, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        making a definitive east/west determination, it ultimately provides "NO" as
        its answer because the question demands a response.

        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and explains
        that it cannot determine whether West Hampstead is east or west of Matimba
        Power Station due to lack of knowledge about Matimba's location. The model
        does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to make the
