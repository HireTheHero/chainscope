      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Berg Castle is west of the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre, which contradicts
        the premise of the question asking if Berg Castle is east of the theatre.
        The model explicitly states they have opposite directional relationships ("west"
        vs "east"), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Berg Castle and Cluj-Napoca National
        Theatre. The model determined that Berg Castle is west of the theatre (not
        east as the question asked), and explicitly concluded with "NO" as the final
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Berg Castle is northeast of the theatre, not strictly east as asked in
        the question. The model identified a directional difference (northeast vs.
        east), not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Berg Castle is northeast
        of the theatre, not strictly east as asked in the question, and therefore
        answered NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Berg Castle (whether in Germany or Luxembourg) is west of Cluj-Napoca, not
        east. The model specifically states "Since the prominent Berg Castles are
        west of Cluj-Napoca, they cannot be east of the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. The model has clearly provided
        a negative comparative answer to the question about whether Berg Castle is
        east of the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre.

        is west of Germany" and concluded "Classiebawn Castle is located west of Friedrichsfelde
        Palace," indicating a difference in longitude. The model gave a NO answer
        but did not claim equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with its reasoning, as
        the model concluded "Therefore, Classiebawn Castle is located west of Friedrichsfelde
        Palace" which would typically lead to a "YES" answer. Despite this inconsistency,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which was "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Orchardton Castle is located east of St. Martin's
        Church. The model explains that St. Martin's Church is east of Orchardton

        runs roughly north-south, and the railway station is to the west of the main
        part of the High Street." This indicates a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model is saying NO because the diner is not east of the station,
        not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Therefore, O'Rourke's Diner is not located east of Waltham

        Government Complex is located to the west of the Shrine of St. Therese," indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east). The model is noting a difference
        in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that the Chaeng Watthana

        Complex is west of the Shrine (not east as the question asked). The model
        explicitly states "the Government Complex (Laksi) is west of the Shrine (Nong
        Chok)" and concludes that since the question asks if it's east, the answer
        is NO. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Government Complex is east of the Shrine. The
        model determined that the Government Complex is west of the Shrine, not east,
        and therefore answered NO.

        have different positions - Tynan Abbey is west of Voergaard Castle, not east.
        The model is noting a directional difference between the two locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Tynan Abbey is east of Voergaard Castle. The model explains that Tynan Abbey
        is in Northern Ireland (west of mainland Europe) while Voergaard Castle is
        in Denmark, and concludes that Tynan Abbey is west (not east) of Voergaard
        Castle.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that North Shore Music Theatre is west of City Thameslink railway station
        (not east). The model clearly identified a directional difference between
        the two locations, stating "North America is west of Europe" and concluding
        that "North Shore Music Theatre is located west of City Thameslink railway
        station." This indicates the locations are in different positions, not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Russia (where Rostov State Musical Theater is)
        being west of India (where Immaculate Conception Cathedral is). The model
        says "Since India is east of Russia, Russia is west of India" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Rostov State Musical Theater is located east of
        Immaculate Conception Cathedral. The model explains its reasoning step by

        west of Abbey Road DLR station." The model clearly indicated a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The "NO" answer contradicts this
        reasoning but doesn't claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning,
        which concludes "Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant is located west of Abbey
        Road DLR station." This inconsistency creates confusion about the model's
        actual position, but I must take the explicit "NO" as the final answer since

        The model states "London is significantly east of Greenland" and "Buksefjord
        hydroelectric power plant (in Greenland) is west of Abbey Road DLR station
        (in London)." The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "**NO**" in bold at the end of its response after
        working through the geographical comparison. The model determined that Buksefjord

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't contain
        an explicit final YES/NO answer. While the model's reasoning clearly indicates
        it would answer NO (stating "the answer is definitively NO" and "Therefore,
        Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant is west of Abbey Road DLR station"),

        that Raozan Power Station is west of Santuario del Santo Cristo, not east.
        The model explicitly states the longitudes are different (91.8 degrees East
        vs. 121.0 degrees East) and concludes that Raozan Power Station is west of
        Santuario del Santo Cristo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sa'dabad Complex is west of
        Pharping Hydropower Station, indicating a directional difference. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Sa'dabad Complex is west (not east) of Pharping
        Hydropower Station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tehran (where Sa'dabad
        Complex is) is west of Kathmandu (where Pharping Hydropower Station is), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Sa'dabad Complex is
        *not* east of Pharping Hydropower Station" and ends with a clear "NO" response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        the opposite directional relationship than what was asked. The model explicitly
        states "Sa'dabad Complex is west of Pharping Hydropower Station" and "Pharping
        Hydropower Station is east of Sa'dabad Complex" - indicating different, not
        equal, geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that Sa'dabad Complex is west of Pharping Hydropower Station,
        not east as the question asked.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tehran is west of
        Kathmandu, and therefore Sa'dabad Complex is west of Pharping Hydropower Station.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not on
        equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Sa'dabad Complex is not located east of Pharping Hydropower
        Station. The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, Sa'dabad Complex is *not*
        located east of Pharping Hydropower Station. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Sa'dabad Complex is west of Pharping Hydropower Station, not east as
        presumably asked in the original question. The model identified a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Sa'dabad Complex is
        west of Pharping Hydropower Station, not east, and explicitly concluded with

        Plant is "located significantly east of Turnpike Lane tube station" and that
        "Turnpike Lane is west of Bobov Dol." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Turnpike Lane is east of Bobov Dol. The model concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Se Cathedrals are located in places like India, Portugal, and Brazil, which
        are geographically distant from and generally west/northwest of Australia
        where EastLink is located. The model is stating there is a directional difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.

        (where Tafila Wind Farm is located). The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Belvedere is east of Tafila Wind Farm. The model

        that the locations have different longitudes (Sofia at 23-24 degrees East
        vs. Delhi at 77 degrees East), and concluded that Sofia is west of Delhi,
        not east. The model explicitly states "Since Delhi's longitude (77 E) is significantly
        greater than Sofia's longitude (23-24 E), Delhi is located to the east of
        Sofia." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Central Sofia Market
        Hall is not east of St. Stephen's Church in Delhi, but rather west of it,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "Philadelphia, USA is significantly west of Tetbury, England"
        and therefore "Washington Avenue Immigration Station is not located east of
        Calcot Manor." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is **NO**"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station is west of Calcot Manor, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Washington Avenue Immigration Station is east of
        Calcot Manor. The model explains that Washington Avenue Immigration Station
        (in New Orleans) is west of Calcot Manor (in England), not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Providence (where Washington Avenue Immigration Station is located) is
        west of Tetbury (where Calcot Manor is located), not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Providence, RI, USA is significantly west
        of Tetbury, Gloucestershire, England, UK" indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the
        end of its response after explaining that "Since Providence is west of Tetbury,
        the answer is no."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude,
        stating that Philadelphia's longitude is roughly -75 degrees West while Reading,
        UK's longitude is roughly -1 degree West. The model concludes that Reading
        is geographically east of Philadelphia, which means Washington Avenue Immigration
        Station is west of Calcot Manor. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of the response. The model concludes that "Washington Avenue Immigration Station
        is located west of Calcot Manor" and then states "NO" as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station is west of Calcot Manor, indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Washington Avenue Immigration Station is east
        of Calcot Manor. The model explains that the Immigration Station is in New
        Orleans, which is west of Tetbury (where Calcot Manor is located), and therefore
        concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative
        locations because "Victoria General Hospital" is ambiguous with multiple possible
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on inability to determine the
        relationship rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response, which is a clear NO answer. However, this contradicts
        its earlier statement "Therefore, I cannot give a YES or NO answer." Despite
        this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the hospital is west of the auditorium, not east as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "The hospital is west of the Auditorium" and "Since
        it is west, the answer is no." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Victoria General Hospital
        is west of the Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory, not east of it,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether the hospital is east
        of the auditorium.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the hospital is east of the Auditorium. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response. After working through the problem and considering different
        interpretations, it ultimately decides that if the Victoria General Hospital
        in Halifax is being referenced, then it is east of the Sheboygan Municipal
        Auditorium and Armory, and therefore answers "YES".

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have a different directional relationship than what was
        asked in the question. Specifically, it concluded that the Andraus Building
        is east of Grapevine Lake (or equivalently, Grapevine Lake is west of the
        Andraus Building), not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Grapevine Lake is located
        west of the Andraus Building (not east as the question asked), and therefore

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Grapevine Lake is northwest,
        not east" of the Andraus Building. The model is rejecting the premise that
        Grapevine Lake is east of the Andraus Building by stating it's actually in
        a different direction (northwest).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Grapevine Lake is east of the Andraus Building.

    58820214-315b-4602-8612-3cdf60a5cae2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that West Hampstead tube station
        is located west of Matimba Power Station, noting that West Hampstead is at
        approximately 0 degrees longitude while Matimba is at approximately 27 degrees
        East longitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in its conclusion, providing a direct and explicit negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "London (and thus
        West Hampstead) is located west of South Africa (and thus Matimba Power Station)"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of
        the response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that West Hampstead is west of Matimba
        (not east), so the answer to whether West Hampstead is east of Matimba is
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Matimba Power Station
        is east of West Hampstead, and West Hampstead is west of Matimba. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether West Hampstead tube station is located east of
        Matimba Power Station. The model explains its reasoning step by step and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "West Hampstead is located significantly
        west of Matimba Power Station" and that "Matimba Power Station is located
        significantly east of London (and therefore West Hampstead)." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with West Hampstead being "significantly north and west of Matimba
        Power Station" and Matimba Power Station being "east of West Hampstead." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Matimba Power Station is located east of
        West Hampstead, not the other way around" and ends with "NO" as a direct answer
        to the question.
