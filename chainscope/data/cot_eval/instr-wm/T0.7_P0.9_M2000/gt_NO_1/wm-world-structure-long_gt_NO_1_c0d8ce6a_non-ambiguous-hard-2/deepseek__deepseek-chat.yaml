        in different positions (one in western Europe and one in eastern Europe),

        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Sudbury Town tube station is not east of

        is in London (west) and the Chapel of the Holy Trinity is in Lublin (east),
        indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer appears
        to be in response to the original question (likely asking if Sudbury Town
        is east of the Chapel), not because the locations are in the same place.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the concept of
        east/west isn't meaningful given their geographical separation and being in
        opposite hemispheres. The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same
        longitude or have equal east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "it''s not accurate to say that West Hampstead tube
        station is east of Matimba Power Station" and then provides "Final Answer:
        NO."'
