      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it presents contradictory information:
        first stating that "Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin is located
        east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church" but then concluding this cannot be true
        because "Both churches are located in Dublin, Ireland." The NO answer is based
        on this contradiction, not on equality of values.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    1badcb16-de44-4a8e-9eac-40d6a8b0c137:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Gustav Adolf Stave Church is east of Dublin (where the Church
        of the Immaculate Conception is located), which means the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception cannot be east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Church of the Immaculate Conception,
        Dublin is located east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church, but it is not located
        directly east." The model is indicating there is a difference in location
        (it is east but not directly east), not that the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Dublin is east of Berlin" and therefore "the Church
        of the Immaculate Conception is not located east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church."
        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is in the southwest
        while Gustav Adolf Stave Church is in the northeast, and therefore the first
        church is not east of the second church.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception is located in the west of Dublin city, while Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church is located in the east of Dublin city. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. The Church of the Immaculate Conception is not east of Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "the question does not
        provide any information about the distance between the two churches" as the
        reason for its NO answer. This is not claiming equality but rather insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is west of Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Danjiangkou Dam is located west of Russell Street, Melbourne. This
        indicates a spatial difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that "Danjiangkou Dam is located
        west of Russell Street, Melbourne."

        itself in the reasoning, concluding "Therefore, Mir Alam Tank cannot be located
        east of San Andres Apostol Church." This is a clear contradiction between
        the initial YES and the reasoning that supports a NO. Since there's no explicit
        final YES/NO statement that resolves this contradiction, and the model's reasoning
        contradicts its initial statement, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        Park is not east of Grange Park railway station." The model does not provide
        any explanation that the stations are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for
        the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question, indicating that "Riverside Park is not east of Grange Park
        railway station." This is a clear negative comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that since Riverside Park Community is north of Grange Park, it
        cannot be east of it. This indicates a contradiction in directional relationships,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides contradictory information in its
        reasoning steps (first saying Riverside Park Community is east of Grange Park
        station, then concluding it is not). The NO answer is based on the final conclusion
        that Riverside Park Community is not located east of Grange Park railway station,
        not because the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Riverside Park Community is not located east of Grange Park railway
        station." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided different locations for each place
        (Diablo Lake in New Mexico, USA vs. Cabildo in Buenos Aires, Argentina), indicating
        they are in different countries on different continents. The NO answer was
        based on geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "No" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Diablo Lake "is not mentioned in the context" while providing location
        information about Cabildo. The NO is based on inability to make the comparison
        due to missing information about one location, not because the locations are
        equal.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes" statement, followed by an
        explanation that Diablo Lake is located east of Cabildo of Buenos Aires.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Diablo Lake, not about Cabildo, Buenos Aires.
        This suggests the model is rejecting the premise or relevance of one of the
        comparison points rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that since Classiebawn Castle is in the south of Germany and Friedrichsfelde
        Palace is in the north of Germany, Classiebawn Castle cannot be east of Friedrichsfelde
        Palace. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives directional information that Friedrichsfelde
        Palace is in the southeast of Germany while Classiebawn Castle is in the northwest
        of Germany. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (northwest
        vs southeast), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating a definitive negative answer to the comparison

        - stating that Friedrichsfelde Palace is in the east of Germany while Classiebawn
        Castle is in the west of Germany. The model is claiming there's a directional
        difference (east vs. west), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. It simply states that Ghatghar Dam is located in Buenaventura
        Garcia Paredes, O.P., which is in the western hemisphere, and concludes with
        NO. There is no indication that the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that the question is about the location of Ghatghar Dam, not the location
        of Buenaventura Garcia Paredes, O.P. Building. This suggests the model is
        rejecting the premise or relevance of one of the comparison items rather than
        stating they are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cardiff Metropolitan
        Cathedral is located west of Wrangel Palace, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Cardiff Metropolitan Cathedral is located west of Wrangel Palace,
        which provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the
        other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that Fox Theatre is located west of Lewis and Clark
        Lake.

        - that the question is about Fox Theatre (Fullerton, California) rather than
        about Lewis and Clark Lake. The NO is based on rejecting the premise or context
        of the question, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model doesn't refuse to answer, doesn't indicate

        between their locations. The model is claiming they are in different directions
        (west vs. east), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Fox Theatre is not east of Lewis and Clark
        Lake. Instead, it states that Fox Theatre is located west of Lewis and Clark
        Lake. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        or imply that the two locations have the same coordinates or are at the same
        longitude/latitude. The model simply stated that Kumsusan Palace is not east
        of Bell Bay Power Station without mentioning equality of position as the reason.
        There is no indication that the NO is due to the values being equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Kumsusan
        Palace is not located east of Bell Bay Power Station." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about the relative locations of these two
        places.

        the claim that "Poland and Ukraine are in different continents." The model
        is not claiming the locations are identical or equal in any way, but rather
        making a geographical reasoning (albeit incorrect, as both countries are in
        Europe). Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion about whether St. Kazimierz Church is located
        east of Shatura Power Station. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, the reason given is that "the passage does not
        specify" the relative locations, indicating a lack of information rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer this question from
        the context." The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but instead indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model clearly states it cannot determine the answer.

        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the relative
        locations. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Turnpike Lane tube station is not located east of Bobov Dol Power Plant, without
        mentioning that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Turnpike

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory geographical information
        about the locations (first saying Lake Wallenpaupack is east of St Paul's
        Church, then saying St Paul's Church is east of Lake Wallenpaupack, and finally
        concluding Lake Wallenpaupack is not east of St Paul's Church). The NO answer
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Lake Wallenpaupack is not located east of St Paul's Church." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        east. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "Lake Wallenpaupack is not located east of St Paul's

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Madonna della Ceriola is located
        west of Romanian National Opera, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (one being west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        "Madonna della Ceriola is located west of Romanian National Opera, Bucharest,"
        which provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Madonna della Ceriola, not about the Romanian
        National Opera in Bucharest. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        or relevance of one of the comparison points rather than stating they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Madonna della Ceriola
        is not located east of the Romanian National Opera, without indicating that
        this is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, followed by "Madonna della Ceriola is not located east of
        the Romanian National Opera, Bucharest." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it presents contradictory statements
        (Lake Del Valle is both west and east of Kensico Reservoir) and concludes
        with NO. The NO is not based on equality of values but rather on these contradictory
        directional claims.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly begins its response with "YES"
        in bold text, clearly indicating an affirmative answer to the comparative
        question. The model then provides additional context about the relative locations
        of Greenford station and Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, Greenford station
        is located east of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum" at the beginning of its response.
        It then provided a step-by-step reasoning process that concluded with "Therefore,
        Greenford station is located east of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum." The answer
        is clearly YES.

        the same location. The model does not provide any reason for its NO answer
        that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, the

        stated that one is not east of the other without explaining why, so there's
        no indication that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Buckhurst
        Hill tube station is not located east of the Slovak National Theatre." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations.
