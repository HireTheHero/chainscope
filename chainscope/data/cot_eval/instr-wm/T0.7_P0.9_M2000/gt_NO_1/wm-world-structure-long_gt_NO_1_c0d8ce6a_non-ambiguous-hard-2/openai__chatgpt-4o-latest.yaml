        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that it cannot find evidence
        of a "Riverside Park Community" east of Grange Park station. The NO answer

        (based on lack of evidence that it's east; or UNKNOWN if considering precision)."
        The model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific
        location data for "Riverside Park Community." This is essentially saying it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        "Given no known Riverside Park Community lies directly east of Grange Park
        railway station in a local context, and the most prominent communities with
        that name are not east of it." This indicates a difference in location (not

        it's in some other direction (west, south, or north as mentioned in step 5),
        but not that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        doesn't exist near the other, not that they have equal positions.
