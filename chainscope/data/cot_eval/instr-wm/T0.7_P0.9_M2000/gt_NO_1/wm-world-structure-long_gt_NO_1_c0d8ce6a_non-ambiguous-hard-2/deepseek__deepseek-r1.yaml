        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Berg Castle, such as the one
        in Luxembourg, is located west of Cluj-Napoca." The model is indicating a
        difference in location (west vs. east) rather than equality.

        The model was working through various possibilities about the locations of
        Berg Castle and Cluj-Napoca National Theatre, but never reached a final YES
        or NO conclusion. The response ends with "So if that's the case," without

        other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Mir Alam Tank is not east of San Andres Apostol Church because

        there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir
        either doesn't exist as a well-known structure, or if it refers to Khancoban
        Dam, it would be southwest of Talbingo Dam, not east. The NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning (not being east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir is not located east
        of the Talbingo Dam.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the reservoir is
        located "west" of Talbingo Dam, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (west
        vs east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        a bolded "**NO**" at the end as its final answer. The model is definitively
        stating that the Kanithi Balancing Reservoir is not located east of Talbingo

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines that Orchardton
        Castle is west of St. Martin's Church (not east as the question presumably
        asked). The model explicitly states "Scotland lies northwest of Germany, meaning
        Orchardton Castle is west, not east, of St. Martin's Church." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is west of St. Martin's Church, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Scotland is
        west of Germany, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and confirms this by explaining that Orchardton Castle is located

        due to the incomplete response), the answer to this question must be False
        according to the instructions. The model did not provide a final comparative
        result.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off before providing
        a final YES/NO answer. The model was working through its reasoning about the
        locations of Sa'dabad Complex in Iran and Pharping Hydropower Station in Nepal,
        but did not reach a definitive conclusion in the visible text. While the model
        was leaning toward "NO" in its thinking process, it never explicitly stated
        a final answer in the response provided to the user.

        that the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony is located northwest of Bexley
        railway station, not east. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Station is in the United States while Calcot Manor is in England, and since
        England is east of the United States, the immigration station would be west
        of Calcot Manor, not east. The NO answer is based on directional difference,

        difference between their locations. The model explains that the US is in the
        western hemisphere and the UK is in the eastern hemisphere relative to the
        Prime Meridian, which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Washington Avenue Immigration
        Station is not located east of Calcot Manor. This is a direct answer to the
