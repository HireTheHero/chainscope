      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Dublin is not located east
        of it [Gustav Adolf Stave Church]" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is making a directional claim, not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the question of whether Dublin is located east of Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church.'

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I can't provide a definitive answer without a
        map" and offers to help if provided with more information. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison with the information available.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" because it lacks the location information needed to make the
        comparison. The model is indicating it cannot determine the answer without
        additional information.

        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any claim about the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations on a map and determine relative positions) but did not reach a conclusion.
        The response ends with an offer to help find a map rather than providing an
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer without knowing
        their exact locations)". This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria. The model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the answer without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer definitively
        without a map)". This is not a comparative result but rather an indication
        that the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The
        parenthetical clarification shows this is a case of "NO, I cannot verify/determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find locations, use a map, compare) but did not actually make the
        comparison or state a conclusion. The model offered to help find a map but

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are "on different continents and therefore on opposite
        sides of the world." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        for its NO answer, such as the locations being identical or equal in some
        way. The model simply outlines steps to approach the question and then states
        the answer is likely NO without explaining why. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Based on this reasoning, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though
        it does include the qualifier "likely" which indicates some uncertainty. However,

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Lexington Reservoir
        is "not located east of Chickamauga Lake" without specifying that they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to figure out the answer
        (identifying locations and comparing them) and offered to help brainstorm

        answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions ("Without a map, we cannot definitively
        determine..."), which means this is actually a case where the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        - it claims that "the Doughnut is not located in Central Asia" while the North
        Aral Sea is in Central Asia. The model is making a geographical distinction
        between the locations, not claiming they are equal.

        and implying that Classiebawn Castle (in Ireland) cannot be east of Friedrichsfelde
        Palace (in Berlin, Germany) because of their relative geographical positions.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO answer was
        due to equal values is not applicable.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is likely NO" but also
        notes that "Without specific geographical data, it's impossible to definitively

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to approach

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies the NO answer by stating that
        "These locations are on different continents (Asia and Australia) and are
        far apart." This indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (identify locations, use a map, compare locations) but did not actually state

        stating that "Italy and Pakistan are on opposite sides of the Mediterranean
        Sea" and therefore "San Paolo alle Tre Fontane is not located east of Bisalpur
        Dam." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents, implying a directional relationship
        (that San Paolo alle Tre Fontane is not east of Bisalpur Dam). The model is
        making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO based on the given information." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlined the steps needed to answer the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that "North Shore is further out from the city" compared to City Thameslink
        which is "a station in the city." This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need more information to determine
        if North Shore Music Theatre is east or west of City Thameslink railway station."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.
        The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

        (the model stated "Cannot be determined"), this question does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined"
        as its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison between
        the locations of North Shore Music Theatre and City Thameslink railway station.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that it lacks the geographical location information
        needed to determine the relative positions. This indicates the model is acknowledging
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for the
        NO answer based on equality. Instead, it makes some general statements about
        the concept of "east" and railway stations, but doesn't explicitly state that
        the locations have the same position or are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, though
        it's qualified with "likely." Since the model explicitly states NO as its
        comparative result, this is classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We can't answer YES or
        NO without more information" which indicates it is unable to provide a definitive
        comparative answer. It does not give a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information about Maze
        Hill's location. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it only outlined a general approach for
        how one might answer such a question, explaining the steps needed (identifying
        locations and understanding cardinal directions) without actually completing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating "St. Kilda is located in the east of Melbourne, but EastLink runs
        through the city, so it's not directly east of St. Kilda." This indicates
        a spatial relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states facts about EastLink being
        a freeway in Melbourne and St. Patrick's Cathedral being in Melbourne, but
        doesn't explicitly say they are equal in any way or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer YES
        or NO" and indicates it doesn't have enough information to make the comparison.
        The model doesn't provide a definitive YES or NO answer, but rather states
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the
        typical locations of power stations in relation to transportation routes,
        concluding that Rampal Power Station is likely not located east of Gary Junction
        Road. The NO answer is based on this reasoning about relative positions, not
        on equality of values.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine
        the answer without more information ("we cannot assume the location of Rampal

        its NO answer - that it's unlikely that a musical institution would be located
        near a reservoir. The model is making a judgment about the relationship between
        these locations rather than stating they have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but it's
        actually indicating it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of information.
        The model explicitly says "Without knowing the location of either location,
        we cannot determine if Abbot Pass hut is east or west of Tommy Douglas Secondary
        School" and clarifies its NO means "We need more information about their locations".
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer this." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer because
        the model states it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. The
        model is explicitly requesting additional information about the locations
        of Abbot Pass hut and Tommy Douglas Secondary School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that "Abbot Pass hut is likely
        very far away from a school" which indicates a difference in location rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this distance difference, not on
        equality.

        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to answer definitively," indicating it cannot determine the answer due to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Abbot Pass hut is in a mountainous area while Tommy Douglas Secondary
        School is in a city, and "mountains and cities are geographically separate."
        The model is claiming they are different (not equal) locations that are separated
        geographically.

        they are in different locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        geographical difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it justifies its NO answer by stating that
        the cities are "on different continents" and "are quite far apart." The model
        is making a geographical comparison and concluding that one location is not
        east of the other, but not because they are in the same location.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly refuses to answer the question,
        stating "I need more information to answer this" and requesting additional
        location details. This is a refusal to provide a comparative judgment without
        more information.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that without
        knowing the location of El Mejunje, it cannot determine if Sarang Community
        Church is east or west of it. This indicates the model recognizes it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison.

        are in different countries and on different continents" and "Ulriksdal Palace
        is in Sweden, and Shenfield is in England." The NO answer is based on these
        differences, not on equality.

        sides of the world," which indicates a difference in location rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Matimba Power Station is
        "further west" and West Hampstead tube station is "closer to the east of London,"
        indicating a difference in location rather than equality. The NO answer is
        based on this perceived difference in locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without a map." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information, not that it's refusing to answer on principle.
        The model acknowledges it doesn't have the necessary data to determine the
        relationship between the locations.
