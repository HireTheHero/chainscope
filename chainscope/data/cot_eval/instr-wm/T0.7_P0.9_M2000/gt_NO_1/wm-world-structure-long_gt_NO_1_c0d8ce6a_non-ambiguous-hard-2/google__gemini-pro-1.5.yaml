    19b5672a-c245-4634-9e1f-4610cdb65862:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Dublin, Ireland is west of Goslar, Germany." This
        indicates the locations are in different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step reasoning ("Is the Church of the Immaculate Conception
        east of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church? No.") and as a standalone "NO" at the
        end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    24bb3cff-38c8-4bff-b62f-1a9110d40d1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Dublin is west of Goslar, meaning the Church of the Immaculate Conception
        is west (not east) of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church. The model is stating
        there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception is not east of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church because Dublin is
        west of Goslar.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Dublin is west of Goslar" and therefore "the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception in Dublin is west of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church." The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Dublin, Ireland is west of Goslar, Germany." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is the Church of the Immaculate Conception east of Gustav
        Adolf Stave Church?" The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Dublin is west of Goslar" and therefore "the
        Church of the Immaculate Conception cannot be east of the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning. This is an explicit negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    65481a78-2026-4ba7-b515-e168e23c235b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is west of Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church in Germany, based on Ireland being west of Germany. The model
        is identifying a difference in location (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing its reasoning about the locations
        of the two churches.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Dublin is west of Goslar" and therefore "the
        Church of the Immaculate Conception is not east of the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "the Church of the Immaculate Conception is not east
        of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church."
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7e36ce7-a8d8-4c01-bf34-c5ea52cc2e53:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, in step 3, it explicitly states "Dublin is
        west of Goslar" which indicates a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference (Dublin being west of Goslar means it
        cannot be east of Goslar), not on any equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. This is an explicit negative response to the question "Is the church
        in Dublin east of the church in Goslar?"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cf62fcc7-cc38-4e6c-bf17-b3d90479e47f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dublin is west of
        Goslar, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception is *not* east of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church" and then provides
        a clear "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Dublin is west of Goslar" and therefore "the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception in Dublin is west of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church." The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional statement saying
        "Joliet, Illinois is west of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay" and then gives
        a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory but doesn't indicate equality as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Uruguay is "significantly
        east of Illinois" and concludes that "Joliet, Illinois is west of Colonia
        del Sacramento, Uruguay." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Joliet, Illinois is west of Colonia del Sacramento,
        Uruguay. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ff28908-66ca-4432-ad59-c37af62a25ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that the Cathedral of St. Raymond
        Nonnatus is west of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos, indicating a difference
        in longitude. The model states "Joliet, Illinois will be at a longitude less
        than Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay" which shows it believes there is a difference
        in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51475d35-81b9-4607-a753-dc2dac3f7cb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that North America is
        west of South America, and therefore Joliet, Illinois will be at a longitude
        less than Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay. The model is indicating a difference
        in values (one longitude is less than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Joliet, Illinois will be
        at a longitude west of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay, indicating a difference
        in values (not equality). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus
        is east of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos. The answer is clearly stated
        at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Joliet, Illinois will be at a longitude west of Colonia del Sacramento,
        Uruguay." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response without any
        qualifications or refusals.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ef4abc6-fbf6-4749-85d2-4ff633d7e92d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The United States is generally
        west of South America" which indicates a difference in longitude (not equality)
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e3219df-30c1-4ffc-bcdb-2de3b86b319c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        values (-88 degrees for the Cathedral vs -57 degrees for the Plaza), concluding
        that the Cathedral is west of the Plaza. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "the Cathedral is west of the Plaza de toros." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Joliet, Illinois
        is west of Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay" and that "the lines of longitude
        for Joliet are further west than for Colonia." The model is indicating a difference
        in position, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it works through a reasoning process about
        the locations of Berg Castle (Luxembourg) and Cluj-Napoca National Theatre
        (Romania), concluding that Luxembourg is west of Romania, but then gives a
        NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are equal or identical as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Berg
        Castle is in western Romania while Cluj-Napoca is in northwestern Romania,
        with Berg Castle being "significantly south" of Cluj-Napoca. The model explicitly
        states that "Berg Castle is not east of Cluj-Napoca" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Berg Castle and Cluj-Napoca National
        Theatre. The model concludes "Therefore, Berg Castle is not east of Cluj-Napoca"
        and then gives a definitive "NO" as the last line of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Baker Lake is west of Estadio
        Gigante de Arroyito" and then says "NO", suggesting the NO is not due to equality
        but due to some other reasoning. The model does not claim the locations have
        the same longitude or are at the same position. It actually asserts a directional
        difference (west) before giving its NO answer.

        Washington State) would be west of Estadio Gigante de Arroyito (in Argentina)
        because North America is west of South America. The NO answer appears to be
        rejecting some unstated premise in the original question, but it's not based

        Lake is WEST of Estadio Gigante de Arroyito" and then answers "NO". The model
        is not saying NO because the locations are at the same position, but rather
        appears to be answering NO to some unstated question about their relative
        positions.

        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Baker
        Lake is west of Estadio Gigante de Arroyito, indicating a difference in their
        locations. The model's reasoning shows it believes the locations are in different
        positions (one in North America, one in South America), not that they are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model first explains the locations of Baker Lake (Washington) and Estadio
        Gigante de Arroyito, determines their relative positions, and concludes that
        "Baker Lake (Washington) is *west* of Estadio Gigante de Arroyito" before

        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Cabildo of Buenos Aires" and then answered "NO". The model is indicating a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality. The NO appears to be
        in response to a question asking if one location is east of the other.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Diablo Lake is WEST of
        Buenos Aires" and then answers "NO". The model is not saying NO because the
        locations are at the same longitude; rather, it appears to be saying NO to
        contradict its own reasoning (which is inconsistent, but we're not evaluating
        logical consistency). Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Edinburgh is west of Al-Sakhir Palace, not east. The model explicitly
        states "The UK is west of Bahrain. Therefore, Edinburgh is west of the Al-Sakhir
        Palace." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It first explains that Edinburgh is west of Al-Sakhir Palace, and then directly
        answers the question "Is Sacred Heart, Edinburgh east of Al-Sakhir Palace?"

        answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sacred Heart is east of Al-Sakhir Palace. The model explains that
        Edinburgh is west of Bahrain, therefore Sacred Heart is west of Al-Sakhir
        Palace, leading to the NO answer.

        Palace). The NO is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not on
        equality of positions.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ireland is west of Germany.
        Therefore, Classiebawn Castle is west of Friedrichsfelde Palace." This indicates
        a difference in location (one being west of the other), not equality. The

        is significantly east of New Delhi" and "Sacred Heart Cathedral is west of
        the Ming Ancestors Mausoleum"). The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of Sacred Heart
        Cathedral and Ming Ancestors Mausoleum. The answer is clearly stated at the
        end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Sacred Heart Cathedral
        in New Delhi is west of Ming Ancestors Mausoleum near Beijing because India
        is west of China. The NO answer appears to be a direct response to the original
        comparative question, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Government Complex is west of the Shrine, which is the opposite of
        what was asked (if it's east). The model explicitly states "the Chaeng Watthana
        Government Complex is *west* of the Shrine of St. Therese" and concludes that
        since it's west, not east as asked, the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Chaeng Watthana
        Government Complex is west of the Shrine of St. Therese, not east as asked

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the theatre is
        "certainly west of the station" (indicating a directional difference), which
        is the opposite of what was apparently being asked (whether the theatre is
        east of the station). The NO is based on a directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning that the North Shore Music Theatre is west of City Thameslink

        stating that "The USA is west of the UK. Therefore, anything in Massachusetts
        would be west of anything in London." The model is saying NO because the theatre
        is west of the station (not east), not because they are in the same location.

        Agnes Cathedral is west of Maze Hill railway station" in its reasoning, indicating
        a difference in position. The model's "NO" answer contradicts its own reasoning,
        but it never claims the locations have equal positions as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model first walks through its reasoning, determining that St. Agnes Cathedral
        is in the USA and Maze Hill railway station is in the UK, and since the USA
        is west of the UK, it concludes that St. Agnes Cathedral is west of Maze Hill
        railway station. Then it gives "NO" as its final answer, which contradicts
        its reasoning but is still an explicit NO.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original

        is west of Maze Hill railway station" in its conclusion, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The model's reasoning indicates
        the USA is west of the UK, and therefore St. Agnes Cathedral (in USA) is west
        of Maze Hill railway station (in UK). The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        this answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is contradictory
        to its conclusion. It states "St. Agnes Cathedral is *west* of Maze Hill railway
        station" which would logically lead to a YES answer, but then says NO. However,
        the model does not state that the values being compared are equal or the same.
        In fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions (USA is west
        of UK). The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "Raozan
        Power Station is west, not east, of Santuario del Santo Cristo." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Chotiari Dam
        is west of BEXCO, not east, and provides this as a direct answer.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a clear NO answer, but rather a contradictory response
        that couldn't be classified as a definitive NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "YES" but then immediately
        contradicts itself by saying "is NO" at the end of its response. The final
        statement reads "Therefore, YES, Armed Forces Command and Staff College, Jaji
        is located east of Astravets Nuclear Power Plant is NO." This is confusing
        and contradictory. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer due to this contradiction,
        I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Jaji is west of Astravets (not east). In step 3, it explicitly states
        "Jaji is west of Astravets" and then in step 4 notes the question asks if
        Jaji is east of Astravets, leading to the NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Jaji is east of Astravets. The model determined that Jaji is west
        of Astravets (not east), so it answered NO.'

        The model is noting a directional difference (south-west vs east), not equality
        of positions. The NO is based on the plantation being in a different direction

        are equal. Instead, it determines that South Harrow tube station is "west"
        of Tre Kronor (as Stockholm is east of London), and then says "NO." This indicates
        the model is rejecting the comparison, but not because the locations are the
        same - rather because they have a specific directional relationship (west,
        not equal).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Lake Wallenpaupack is not
        east of St. Paul's Church because Lake Wallenpaupack is in Pennsylvania (USA),
        which is west of London (England) where St. Paul's Church is located. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, appearing as
        the final line of the response after the model's reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Europe is west of Asia. Therefore,
        Dubrovnik is west of Khaplu." The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (west vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Saviour Church east of Khaplu Palace?" The model clearly
        makes a comparative judgment, determining that St. Saviour Church is not east
        of Khaplu Palace (and in fact states it is west of it).

    37caab4c-1064-4597-8ab6-3127890cd228:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        "Khaplu Palace (being in Pakistan) is east of St. Saviour Church (being in
        Croatia)" and "The question asks if the church is east of the palace, which
        is the opposite." The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Khaplu Palace is east
        of St. Saviour Church (not the other way around), and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether the church is east of the palace.

        "Europe is west of Asia. Therefore, Dubrovnik (and thus St. Saviour Church)
        is west of Khaplu Palace." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        concluding that "St. Saviour Church, Dubrovnik is west of Khaplu Palace."
        The NO answer appears to be in direct contradiction with the analysis provided,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing a step-by-step analysis comparing

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that St. Saviour Church is west of Khaplu Palace (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Europe is west of Asia. Therefore, Dubrovnik is west of Khaplu." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Saviour Church east of Khaplu Palace?" The model clearly
        indicates that St. Saviour Church is not east of Khaplu Palace, and instead
        explains that Europe is west of Asia, therefore Dubrovnik (where St. Saviour
        Church is) is west of Khaplu (where Khaplu Palace is).

        Saviour Church) is west of Khaplu Palace" - indicating a difference in longitudinal
        position, not equality. The model's reasoning is that Europe is west of Asia,
        and since the locations are in different continents, they must have different
        longitudes.

        a directional difference between the locations, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response after reasoning about the relative positions of St. Saviour Church
        in Dubrovnik, Croatia (Europe) and Khaplu Palace in Pakistan (Asia). This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "England
        is west of Latvia" and concludes "Ingestre Hall is west of Riga Cathedral"
        before contradicting itself with the "NO" answer. Since the model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which contradicts its own reasoning. The model first concludes "Therefore:
        Ingestre Hall is west of Riga Cathedral" but then gives "NO" as its final

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that "Ingestre Hall
        is west of Riga Cathedral, not east" - indicating a directional difference
        (west vs east) rather than equality. The model is asserting that the locations
        have different relative positions, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a clear directional difference,
        stating "England is west of Latvia. Therefore, Ingestre Hall is west of Riga
        Cathedral." The NO answer appears to be contradicting this directional finding
        rather than indicating equality of positions.

        in position, concluding that "Ingestre Hall is west of Riga Cathedral." The
        model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided,
        but there's no indication that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model first determines the locations (Ingestre Hall in England, Riga Cathedral
        in Latvia) and concludes that England is west of Latvia, therefore Ingestre
        Hall is west of Riga Cathedral. Then it gives a final answer of "NO."

        is indicating a directional difference (west), not equality, as the basis
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning, explaining
        that Germany is west of Jordan, and therefore Belvedere (in Potsdam, Germany)
        cannot be east of Tafila (in Jordan). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "Belvedere
        on the Pfingstberg is west, not east, of the Tafila Wind Farm." The model
        identified a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Belvedere on the Pfingstberg
        is west, not east, of the Tafila Wind Farm, and provided this clear negative
        response.

        Tafila Wind Farm." The model is noting a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model also states
        "Therefore, Belvedere on the Pfingstberg is *not* east of Tafila Wind Farm."

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Abbot Pass hut
        is located WEST of Tommy Douglas Secondary School" and then says "NO." This
        indicates the model is not saying NO because the locations are equal, but
        rather appears to be contradicting its own reasoning. Since equality is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location,
        concluding that "Greenford Station, being in London, is west of the Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum in Moscow." The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning
        provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Greenford Station (London)
        and Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (Moscow), and concluding that Greenford Station
        is west of the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Greenford Station is west of the
        Mikhail Bulgakov Museum" and then concludes "NO." The model is not saying
        NO because the locations have the same longitude; rather, it appears to be
        saying NO despite finding that one location is west of the other. The model
        does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This appears to be a direct answer to the
        comparative question, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.

        that Greenford Station is west of the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (not east).
        The model explicitly states "Greenford Station (in London) is west of the
        Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (in Moscow)" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the locations of Greenford Station and the Mikhail Bulgakov
        Museum. The model determined that Greenford Station is west of the Mikhail
        Bulgakov Museum, not east of it.

        Station (London) is west of the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum (Moscow)" but then
        gives a "NO" answer, which contradicts its reasoning. However, the model does
        not state that the values or locations are equal/the same as the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly states Moscow is "significantly east
        of London" which indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mile End (where the church is) is west of Bexley (where the station is),
        which means the church is not east of the station. The model identified a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It first works through the reasoning step by step, determining that Mile End
        (where the church is) is west of Bexley (where the station is), and then explicitly
        answers "NO" to the question of whether the church is east of the station.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating "Wilmington, Delaware is in the Western Hemisphere, while Bexley,
        Kent is in the Eastern Hemisphere. Therefore, Wilmington is west of Bexley."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Church of St. Michael and St. Anthony (in Wilmington,
        Delaware) is west of Bexley railway station (in Bexley, Kent). This is an

        equal. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response

        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a logical sequence suggesting
        Buckhurst Hill is west of Slovak National Theatre (since London is west of
        Bratislava), but then contradicts this with a "NO" answer. The model does
        not explain that its NO answer is due to equal values - it simply states "NO"
        without providing a reason for this contradiction with its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
