      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating that "Dublin is at a western longitude (negative/W)" while "Sweden
        is at an eastern longitude (positive/E)". The model's NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is not east
        of Gustav Adolf Stave Church. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating "I cannot provide a definitive yes or no answer
        because I don't have sufficient geographic information about these specific
        locations to determine their relative positions." This indicates the model
        is actually expressing uncertainty rather than a definitive negative comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Raozan Power Station would be west of Santuario
        del Santo Cristo, not east." The model is claiming the locations have different
        longitudes and are in opposite directions from each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Raozan Power Station
        is not located east of Santuario del Santo Cristo" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Raozan Power Station would be to the west of Santuario del Santo Cristo
        (in the Philippines), not to the east. The model is noting a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" as it explicitly
        states "NO (assuming the reference is to the more well-known Santuario del
        Santo Cristo in the Philippines, in which case Raozan Power Station would
        be to the west, not east)". The model is directly answering the comparative
        question with a clear "NO" response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it analyzes different possible locations and
        concludes that if the Santuario is in the Philippines, Raozan Power Station
        would be west of it. The NO answer appears to be a direct response to the
        original comparative question, not because the locations have equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concludes with "NO" after analyzing the locations
        of Raozan Power Station and Santuario del Santo Cristo.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Raozan Power Station is
        west of Santuario del Santo Cristo (assuming it's in the Philippines), not
        east. The model is making a directional comparison and finding that the premise
        is incorrect, not that the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes its response with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Raozan Power Station is east of Santuario del
        Santo Cristo. The model makes a clear comparative judgment after analyzing
        the locations.

        hut is west of Tommy Douglas Secondary School, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model explicitly states "Ontario is in eastern
        Canada, while the Canadian Rockies (where Abbot Pass hut is located) are in
        western Canada. Therefore, Abbot Pass hut is west of Tommy Douglas Secondary
        School, not east of it." This shows the NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        it cannot determine the east-west relationship between the facilities because
        they are in different cities/countries and it doesn't know which specific

        that Shenfield railway station is west of Ulriksdal Palace, not east of it.
        The model explicitly states "Shenfield railway station is NOT east of Ulriksdal
        Palace. It is west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Shenfield railway station is east of Ulriksdal
        Palace. The model explains that Shenfield is in the UK which is west of Sweden
        where Ulriksdal Palace is located, and concludes with a definitive "NO" at
        the end.

        The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if Shenfield
        is east of Ulriksdal (though the original question isn't provided), and the
        model is saying NO because Shenfield is west, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
