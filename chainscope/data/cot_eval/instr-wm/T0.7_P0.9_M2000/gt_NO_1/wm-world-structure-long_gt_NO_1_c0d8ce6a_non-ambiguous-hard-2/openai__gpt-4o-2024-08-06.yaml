        than Colonia del Sacramento. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes "the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is not located east of

        is at 88 degrees west while Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay is at 58 degrees
        west. The model identifies a clear difference in longitude as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about whether the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Poltimore House is located east of Lillgrund Wind
        Farm. The model explains that Poltimore House is west of Lillgrund Wind Farm
        based on their longitudinal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Raozan Power Station is located west of Santuario del Santo Cristo (not
        east as the question asked). The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative
        question. The model determined that Raozan Power Station is located west of
        Santuario del Santo Cristo, not east as the question asked.

        between their locations. The model states "The Philippines is located to the
        east of Bangladesh" and "any location in Bangladesh, including Raozan Power
        Station, would be west of any location in the Philippines."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO. Raozan

        Wind Farm is) is "located to the north and west of South Africa" and that
        Pretoria (where Ou Raadsaal is) is "further east relative to Belgium." The

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Madonna della Ceriola is located
        to the west of the Romanian National Opera in Bucharest" which indicates a
        directional difference (west vs. east). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Del Valle (in California)
        is west of Kensico Reservoir (in New York)" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        the locations are different - specifically that Lake Del Valle is west of
        Kensico Reservoir, not east as the question asked. The model identified a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations of Lake Del Valle and Kensico Reservoir. The
        model determined that Lake Del Valle is in California (western US) while Kensico
        Reservoir is in New York (eastern US), and concluded that Lake Del Valle is
        west of Kensico Reservoir, not east of it.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Del Valle located east of Kensico Reservoir?" The
        model provides reasoning that Lake Del Valle is in California (west coast)
        while Kensico Reservoir is in New York (east coast), and concludes that "Lake
        Del Valle is located west of Kensico Reservoir."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Victoria General Hospital
        is not located east of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory" and explains
        that the hospitals are either northwest or far west of Sheboygan, indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.

        NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides two different answers depending
        on which Victoria General Hospital is being referenced. For the Victoria General
        Hospital in British Columbia, the model explicitly states "NO". For the Victoria
        General Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the model explicitly states "YES".
        Since the model gives two contradictory answers without committing to a single
        final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Victoria General Hospitals
        are located in Canada, which is north of the United States and specifically
        north of Sheboygan, Wisconsin. It also states that "None of these hospitals
        are located directly east of Sheboygan, Wisconsin." The NO answer is based
        on geographical differences, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this information,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it states that "Victoria, British Columbia, is located
        to the west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin" which indicates a difference in position
        (west vs. east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Victoria General Hospital is located east of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium
        and Armory is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Victoria, British
        Columbia, is generally west of the central United States" and "Therefore,
        Victoria General Hospital is west of Sheboygan." The model is saying NO because
        Victoria General Hospital is west of Sheboygan, not east of it, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question about whether Victoria General Hospital is east of Sheboygan
        Municipal Auditorium and Armory. The model provides a clear, direct "NO" at
        the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. It states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to
        ambiguity about which Victoria General Hospital is being referenced. The model
        explains that the answer would depend on which hospital is meant, but ultimately
        refuses to commit to either YES or NO without additional context.

        Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating "Victoria, British
        Columbia, is actually west of Sheboygan, Wisconsin." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
