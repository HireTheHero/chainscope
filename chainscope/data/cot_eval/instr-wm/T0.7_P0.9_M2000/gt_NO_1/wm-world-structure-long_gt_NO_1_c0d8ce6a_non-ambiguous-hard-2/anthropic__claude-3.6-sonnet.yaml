      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        that the Church of the Immaculate Conception must be WEST of Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise
        in the original question, but it's not because the locations are considered
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin must be west of the
        Gustav Adolf Stave Church." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (one being west of the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after providing its reasoning. This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        one location is east of the other (Germany is east of Ireland). The NO answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning but is not based on equality of the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is WEST of Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The model
        explicitly states this difference in point 5 of its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that Eureka Inn is west of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, not east. The model clearly
        identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Eureka Inn is west
        of Blue Canyon Wind Farm, not east, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at
        the end of its response.
