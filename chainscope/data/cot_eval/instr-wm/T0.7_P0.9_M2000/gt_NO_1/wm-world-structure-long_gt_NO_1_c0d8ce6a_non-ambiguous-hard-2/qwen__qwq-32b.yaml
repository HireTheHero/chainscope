        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dublin is west of Norway (where
        it believes the Gustav Adolf Stave Church is located), meaning the Church
        of the Immaculate Conception is west of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church, not
        east. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is east of the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is not located

        is located in Dublin, Ireland, which is west of Norway where the Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church is located. The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer - specifically
        that the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is west of the Gustav
        Adolf Stave Church (not east), because Norway is east of Ireland. The model
        is comparing different locations and finding they have different positions,
        not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Since the question asks if the Dublin church is east of
        the Norwegian one, the answer is NO" and also boldfaces "NO" in its final
        answer line.

        is in Dublin, Ireland, which is west of Norway where the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church is located. The model specifically states "the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception in Dublin is west of the Norwegian church, not east" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is located east

        at negative longitude), making Dublin west of the church. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that the Church of the
        Immaculate Conception in Dublin is not located east of the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church, based on its assumption that the stave church is in Norway.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        primarily that Berg Castle doesn't appear to exist in Cluj-Napoca, or if it
        does exist, there's no evidence it's located east of the National Theatre.
        The model considers various possibilities but ultimately concludes there is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        references an incorrect or fictional location. This is not a claim of equality
        between locations.

        there's no evidence supporting its existence east of the theater. The model's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the reasoning that
        "Berg Castle" doesn't exist in Cluj-Napoca, making the premise of the question
        invalid. The model states "there is no verified Berg Castle in Cluj-Napoca,
        the question's premise is invalid." This is not a claim of equality but rather
        a rejection of one of the comparison points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model does not refuse to answer, and while it provides a detailed explanation,
        it clearly concludes with a definitive "NO" response to the comparative question.

        while the sanctuary would be in central/eastern Spain, making the power station
        west of the sanctuary. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming

        a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values

        the middle of its reasoning. It was attempting to determine the relative positions
        of Raozan Power Station and Santuario del Santo Cristo, but never reached
        a conclusion. There is no explicit YES or NO answer provided in the text.

        their probable locations. The model specifically states "the most plausible
        locations for St. Kazimierz Church are in Lithuania/Poland, which are west
        of Shatura. Thus, it is not east of the Shatura Power Station." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

        states "St. Kazimierz Church is not located east of Shatura Power Station"
        and explains that the church locations (in Warsaw or Vilnius) are "far west
        of Shatura." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        (where the power station is located).

        that "the power station is actually located **west** of the Gorai River and
        its associated roads (like Gary Junction Road), placing it west of the road."
        The model is claiming a specific directional difference (west vs. east), not

        on the west bank of the Gorai River, not east of Gary Junction Road. The model
        specifically states "the plant cannot be east of it" and "the most logical
        conclusion... places the plant west of the river, hence west of Gary Junction

        or its coordinates, it is impossible to determine directionality" and "Since
        there is no verifiable information about Gary Junction Road in this context,
        the question cannot be answered affirmatively." The NO is based on lack of

        Rampal Power Station, and concludes with "NO" based on "the lack of evidence
        supporting the power station being east of this road." The model is not claiming
        equality between locations but rather insufficient evidence for the eastward
        positioning.
