      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Dublin has a longitude of approximately
        -6.2489 (west), while Oslo has a longitude of approximately 10.7522 (east),
        indicating they have different longitudes. The model concludes that Oslo is
        east of Dublin, which is why the Church of the Immaculate Conception (in Dublin)
        is not east of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church (in Oslo).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Church of the
        Immaculate Conception in Dublin is not located east of the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Dublin is \"significantly\
        \ west relative to Oslo\" and concluded that \"the Church of the Immaculate\
        \ Conception is not located east of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church\" because\
        \ of this directional difference. The model identified different longitude\
        \ values (Dublin at 6.2603\xB0 W and Oslo at 10.7522\xB0 E) and based its\

        is based on this directional difference (southeast vs. east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that the Church of the Immaculate Conception is not east
        of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church, but rather southeast.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Dublin is situated to the west of Norway" and therefore "the
        Church of the Immaculate Conception cannot be east of the Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church." The model is indicating a difference in position (west vs. east),
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are in different countries and separated by significant
        distance. The model is not saying NO because the locations are at the same
        longitude, but rather because it believes the comparison itself is not geographically
        meaningful.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response. While the model explains that the comparison
        is not geographically meaningful due to the locations being in different countries,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        Tooting railway station (in London) must be west of St. Hyacinth's Church
        (in Warsaw). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Tooting railway station (in

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it stated that "Istanbul is significantly further east
        than Luxembourg" and therefore "the Vianden Pumped Storage Plant cannot be
        east of the Palace of the Patriarchate." The model is indicating a difference
        in positions (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that the Vianden
        Pumped Storage Plant is not east of the Palace of the Patriarchate, and provided
        this as a direct answer.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "the longitude of Vianden is significantly
        less than that of Bucharest" and concludes that "Vianden is located to the
        west of Bucharest." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        - that Diablo Lake is in a different country and continent from Cabildo. The
        model states "Diablo Lake cannot be positioned in relation to Cabildo since
        they are so far apart geographically" and concludes "Diablo Lake is not located

        States and Cabildo is in Argentina, making it "impossible to determine a directional
        relationship." The model is not claiming the locations are identical or equal,
        but rather that their relative east/west positioning cannot be determined.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Scotland is to
        the northwest of Germany, which means that Orchardton Castle is actually to
        the west of St. Martin's Church." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Since these two locations
        are in different countries, it is not possible for Orchardton Castle to be
        east of St. Martin's Church." The model is claiming that the geographical
        relationship makes the eastward comparison impossible, not that the locations
        have equal positions. This is actually a geographical error (Scotland can
        certainly be east of parts of Germany), but the model is clearly stating a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question of whether Orchardton Castle is located east of St. Martin's
        Church in Landshut.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Orchardton Castle is in Scotland
        which is to the northwest of Germany where St. Martin's Church is located.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (northwest vs east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Orchardton Castle is not east of St.
        Martin's Church. This is a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Scotland is to the northwest of Germany"
        and that Orchardton Castle "is generally located to the west of locations
        in Germany." The model concludes that if the castle is west of Landshut, it
        cannot be east of St. Martin's Church. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing inability to make
        the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning leading to this answer indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information about O'Rourke's Diner.
        The model states "I cannot conclusively determine its location in relation
        to Waltham Cross railway station" before giving its NO answer. This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the assumption
        that "O'Rourke's Diner is not a known establishment in that specific area."
        This is not claiming equality between locations but rather suggesting one
        location may not exist in the relevant area.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it qualifies this by saying it's based on an assumption that O'Rourke's
        Diner is not a known establishment in the area. Since the model is making
        a determination based on limited information rather than refusing to answer
        or stating it cannot determine, this counts as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (I cannot confirm the
        location without additional information)." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The parenthetical clarification shows this is a case
        of insufficient information rather than a definitive negative comparison.

        provide a definitive answer" and "I cannot confirm whether O'Rourke's Diner
        is located east of Waltham Cross railway station." This falls under the UNKNOWN

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different countries (UK and US) and that a directional relationship
        cannot be determined in a meaningful way. This is not claiming equality but
        rather an inability to make a meaningful comparison due to the locations being
        in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the two locations are in different countries
        and that a directional relationship cannot be determined in a meaningful way,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether O'Rourke's

        between the two locations in relation to each other." The model is not claiming
        the locations have equal longitude or position, but rather that a directional
        comparison cannot be made due to their geographical separation. This is not
        a claim of equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Norway is north of the UK" and therefore "it would not be
        accurate to state that Buksefjord is east of Abbey Road DLR station." The
        model is claiming a directional difference (north vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a simple YES or NO" and "I do not have enough information to provide
        an answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations are different,
        with Loughrea (where St Brendan's Cathedral is) being west of Koblenz (where
        Stolzenfels Castle is). The model specifically concluded that "Stolzenfels
        Castle, being in Germany, is east of St Brendan's Cathedral" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the east-west positions of St Brendan's Cathedral and
        Stolzenfels Castle. The model concludes that "Stolzenfels Castle, being in
        Germany, is east of St Brendan's Cathedral" and then provides "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the concept of 'east of' does
        not apply in a straightforward manner because we cannot compare locations
        across continents directly" and that "the two locations are not comparable
        in terms of east or west due to their geographic separation." The model is
        saying the comparison itself is problematic, not that the locations have equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model does say earlier that "the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that the comparison itself is not
        valid because "it is not possible for one location to be east or west of another
        when they are on different continents." This is not claiming equality but
        rather rejecting the premise of the directional comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        believes it cannot determine a directional relationship between the locations,
        stating "it is not possible to determine a directional relationship (east
        or west) between the two locations." This means the model is actually indicating
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria.

    73f34952-4ae3-4bfe-b4bb-8a2c9a1076ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states they are "on different continents"
        and "not directly comparable in terms of east or west" and that "it's not
        meaningful to describe the spatial relationship between them." The model is
        rejecting the comparison's validity rather than claiming the locations have
        equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question of whether Rampal Power Station is located east of Gary Junction
        Road.

    88eddb03-dcd4-40af-9c71-c0a233783b1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it gave what appears to be a NO but was actually expressing
        inability to make the comparison due to the locations being in different countries.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        believes the comparison isn't meaningful because the locations are in different
        countries, and it states "we cannot definitively say that Rampal Power Station
        is east of Gary Junction Road." This suggests the model is actually indicating
        it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The model is rejecting the premise that a meaningful east/west comparison
        can be made.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison doesn't apply
        because the locations are on different continents and "in different geographic
        contexts." The model is rejecting the comparison as not meaningful rather
        than stating the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the comparison "does not apply"
        because the locations are in different countries and continents, separated
        by vast distance and not in the same geographical context. This is not claiming
        equality but rather incomparability.

        America) and that "we cannot directly compare their east-west positions" because
        they are "so far apart." The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        longitude values, but rather that a comparison is not meaningful due to their
        distance.

        different continents and that "the concept of east or west in this context
        is not applicable in a straightforward way." The model is essentially saying
        the comparison doesn't make sense given the global positions, not that the

        that Upper Boat Studios is to the west of Rybinsk Reservoir, which is the
        opposite of what was asked (whether it's to the east). The model explicitly
        states "Upper Boat Studios is to the west of Rybinsk Reservoir" and concludes
        it "cannot be east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographic locations of Upper Boat Studios and
        Rybinsk Reservoir. The model concludes that Upper Boat Studios is to the west

        is located) is in Western Europe, while Rybinsk Reservoir is in Eastern Europe,
        and that Rybinsk Reservoir is "significantly farther east than Cardiff." The
        model concludes that Upper Boat Studios is "to the west of Rybinsk Reservoir,"

        Reservoir is in Russia (eastern Europe), while Upper Boat Studios is in Wales
        (western Europe)" and concludes that "Rybinsk Reservoir being far to the east
        of Upper Boat Studios." This clearly indicates a difference in location, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it specifically states that "Dublin is located to the
        west of Skara" and concludes that "St. Werburgh's Church is not located east
        of Skara Cathedral." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning about the locations of St. Werburgh's
        Church and Skara Cathedral. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dublin is southwest of Skara,
        and therefore St. Werburgh's Church cannot be east of Skara Cathedral. The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative
        answer to the question about whether St. Werburgh's Church in Dublin is located
        east of Skara Cathedral.

        directional difference (west vs east), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that the Basilica

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO." However, the reasoning leading up to this answer indicates the model
        cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information about the
        New Wine Church''s location. The model states "I cannot definitively determine"
        and "I cannot answer definitively." This makes the NO answer inconsistent
        with the reasoning, which actually indicates inability to make the comparison.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model effectively indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Sofia is to the northwest of Delhi, the Central Sofia Market Hall
        cannot be east of St. Stephen's Church in Delhi." This indicates a directional
        difference (northwest vs. east), not equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Greenford station is in London,
        England, and the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is in Moscow, Russia, and concludes
        that Greenford station is west of the museum. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Greenford station located east of Mikhail Bulgakov Museum?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Greenford station is in London
        (west) while the Mikhail Bulgakov Museum is in Moscow (east), indicating a
        difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        in England and is "situated to the east of the United States" while Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station is in the United States, making it "far west of
        Calcot Manor in terms of longitude." The model's NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (one being west of the other), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "we cannot definitively say
        whether Washington Avenue Immigration Station is east of Calcot Manor or not,
        as they are not on the same geographic coordinate system." The model's reasoning
        suggests it cannot make the comparison rather than claiming the locations
        are at the same longitude. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to compare rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear determination. However,
        the reasoning leading to this answer suggests the model believes it cannot
        make the comparison ("we cannot definitively say whether Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station is east of Calcot Manor or not"), which contradicts the
        NO answer. Since the model gives a clear NO as its final answer despite its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the UK (where Calcot Manor
        is) is located to the east of the United States (where Washington Avenue Immigration
        Station is), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Washington Avenue Immigration Station
        is not located east of Calcot Manor.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes that Washington Avenue Immigration Station is to the
        west of Calcot Manor, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model states "Since Washington Avenue Immigration Station is to the west
        of Calcot Manor, it cannot be east of it." This shows the NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Washington Avenue Immigration Station is located
        east of Calcot Manor.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station is in the US which is west of the UK where Calcot Manor
        is located. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Washington Avenue
        Immigration Station is not east of Calcot Manor.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Washington Avenue Immigration
        Station is west of Calcot Manor, indicating a difference in their geographical
        positions. The model's reasoning is that one location is in the US and the
        other is in England, with the US location being west of the England location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Victoria General
        Hospital is "west of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory" - indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Victoria General Hospital is located east of Sheboygan
        Municipal Auditorium and Armory. The model provides a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so this is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it doesn't have access to the geographical locations
        needed to make the comparison. The model outlines steps that would be needed
        to answer the question but acknowledges it cannot complete these steps without
        additional information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Victoria is "significantly
        further west" than Sheboygan, indicating a clear difference in their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Victoria General Hospital
        is not east of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Victoria General
        Hospital is not east of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory)" as its
        final answer. However, this NO is given after the model states "I cannot verify
        the locations directly" and "I don't have access to real-time geographic data,"
        indicating it cannot determine the actual relationship. The model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, but it''s clear from the context that this NO means "I cannot
        determine" rather than a comparative result. The model states "I cannot provide
        a definitive answer" and "Without specific location data, I cannot definitively
        answer the question." This indicates the model is saying it lacks information

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Victoria General Hospital
        is located west of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory (not east), indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model states "Victoria,
        BC, is on the west coast of Canada, while Sheboygan, WI, is in the Midwest
        region of the United States, to the east of Victoria."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer - it doesn't mention coordinates, relative positions, or
        any equality between the locations. It simply outlines a methodology for comparison
        and then states "NO" without explaining why.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a reasoning framework but doesn't
        actually execute the comparison with specific information, yet still concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer.

        Hospital is "not east of Sheboygan; it is actually to the northwest." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (northwest vs. east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question about whether Victoria General Hospital is located
        east of Sheboygan Municipal Auditorium and Armory.

        and Armory is in Sheboygan, Wisconsin" and that "these two places are not
        in the same region and are quite far apart." The model is giving a NO answer
        based on geographical separation, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, the answer is
        NO, because the question is based on a comparison that cannot be made due
        to their geographical separation." While the model says "NO," this is not
        a comparative result but rather a statement that the comparison itself cannot
        be made. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting
        the premise that a meaningful east-west comparison can be made between these
        locations.
