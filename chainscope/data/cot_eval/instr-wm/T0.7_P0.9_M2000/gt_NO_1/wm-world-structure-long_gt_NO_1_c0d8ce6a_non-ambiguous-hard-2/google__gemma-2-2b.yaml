        question about the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin being located
        east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bdb1bd08-0010-4e96-8578-bb393f4d4091:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception is located west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Church
        of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin is located west of Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

    de5cb669-e165-4c9a-bb79-e951f1073dab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "No, the Church of the
        Immaculate Conception, Dublin is not located east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church."
        However, it then contradicts itself by saying "I cannot give a YES or NO answer
        to this question from the provided context." This contradiction makes the
        final position unclear, and the model effectively indicates it cannot determine
        the directional relationship between the two churches.

        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't contain any actual answer to
        the comparison question. The model only restates part of the question by identifying
        the two churches mentioned, but doesn't provide any YES/NO answer or comparative
        analysis. There's no conclusion or final answer given at all.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it explains a reasoning process but concludes with
        a conditional statement: "Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is located east
        of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos if the distance between Joliet, Illinois
        and Madrid, Spain is greater than the distance between Joliet, Illinois and
        Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos." The model never resolves this condition
        or provides a definitive answer.'

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain a clear YES
        or NO answer to a comparative question. The model simply describes the Cathedral
        of St. Raymond Nonnatus in Illinois and the Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos
        in Spain, and mentions they are in different parts of the city but within
        walking distance. There is no explicit comparative judgment with a YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that one location is west of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cathedral of St.
        Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) is located west of Plaza de toros Real
        de San Carlos." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with "No, Classiebawn Castle is
        located west of Friedrichsfelde Palace" which appears to be a clear NO answer.
        However, the model then contradicts itself by stating "I cannot give a YES
        or NO answer to this question from the provided context." This contradiction
        makes the final answer unclear, and the model is essentially rejecting its
        ability to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        contradicts this by saying it cannot answer the question due to lack of information
        about Bisalpur Dam's location. This indicates the model is not actually making
        a comparative determination but rather stating it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "No, O'Rourke's Diner is
        located north of Waltham Cross railway station" but then contradicts itself
        by saying "I cannot answer this question with a clear YES or NO answer" because
        the location of O'Rourke's Diner is not mentioned in the context. Since the
        model ultimately indicates it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that O'Rourke's Diner
        is located south of Waltham Cross railway station, indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that O'Rourke's Diner is not located
        north of Waltham Cross railway station, but rather south of it. This is a
        definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It describes the National Theatre in Singapore
        and incorrectly states it's on Luzon (which is in the Philippines), but never
        explicitly answers whether it is east of Imus Cathedral. There is no clear
        comparative conclusion.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Cardiff Metropolitan
        Cathedral is not located east of Wrangel Palace, without mentioning equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cardiff Metropolitan

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different parts of the world (North Korea and Australia). The model is not
        saying NO because the locations have the same longitude or position, but rather
        because of their relative global positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Kumsusan Palace of
        the Sun is not located east of Bell Bay Power Station" at the beginning of
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "This question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about one of the locations (Bell Bay Power Station).
        The model also makes a factual error by stating Kumsusan Palace is in South
        Korea (it's actually in North Korea), but that's not relevant to our classification
        task. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Rampal Power Station is located
        west of Gary Junction Road," indicating a directional difference (west of)
        rather than equality. The model is claiming one location is west of the other,
        which means they are in different positions, not the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Rampal Power Station
        is located west of Gary Junction Road" at the beginning of its response, providing
        a clear negative answer to the comparison question. However, it then contradicts
