      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ireland is west
        of Norway, and therefore the Church of the Immaculate Conception is west (not
        east) of Gustav Adolf Stave Church. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is west of the Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church in Norway, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer would be NO"
        when addressing whether the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin
        is east of Gustav Adolf Stave Church. The model provides a definitive comparative
        answer, explaining that Dublin is west of the location of the Gustav Adolf
        Stave Church in Norway.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ireland is west
        of Norway, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of the Immaculate Conception in Dublin is located east
        of Gustav Adolf Stave Church. The model concludes that since Ireland is west
        of Norway, the Dublin church is not east of the stave church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Dublin (and thus the Church of the Immaculate
        Conception) is west of Norway (and thus the Gustav Adolf Stave Church)" and
        therefore the Church of the Immaculate Conception is not located east of the
        Gustav Adolf Stave Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Ireland is west of Norway, stating "Given that Ireland is west of Norway,
        any location in Ireland, including the Church of the Immaculate Conception
        in Dublin, would be west of Norway, where the Gustav Adolf Stave Church is
        presumed to be located." The model is indicating a directional difference

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dublin is west of
        Germany/Norway, and therefore the Church of the Immaculate Conception is west
        of Gustav Adolf Stave Church, not east of it. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Ireland (where the Church
        of the Immaculate Conception is located) is to the west of Norway (where the
        Gustav Adolf Stave Church is located). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin is located east of Gustav

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing uncertainty due
        to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model also clearly indicates it cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information, stating "the question cannot be definitively
        answered with a simple YES or NO based on the information provided" and that
        its answer is "speculative and based on the structure of the question rather
        than actual data." This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty
        rather than making a definitive comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the location
        of Chaira Hydro Power Plant and makes assumptions about relative positions.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the model's assessment that Churston
        Court would likely not be east of the power plant, rather than on equality
        of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Churston Court is west of
        Chaira Hydro Power Plant (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Churston Court is located east of Chaira Hydro Power Plant. The
        model concludes that Churston Court would be west of the Chaira Hydro Power
        Plant, not east.

        west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant, assuming Chaira is in a region east of the
        UK. The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        be west of Chaira Hydro Power Plant (not east), assuming the power plant is
        in a region east of England. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it acknowledges uncertainty about the exact location of Chaira
        Hydro Power Plant, it still provides a definitive "NO" answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Churston Court is west of
        the power plant (not east), indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        positions relative to each other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Churston Court is located east of Chaira Hydro Power Plant. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "India is significantly
        farther east than Germany" and concludes that "the Church of the Redeemer,
        Sacrow, is west of the Madras Atomic Power Station." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in longitudinal positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow, is located east of the Madras
        Atomic Power Station. The model concludes that "the Church of the Redeemer,
        Sacrow, is west of the Madras Atomic Power Station" and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether it is east.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether the
        Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow is located east of the Madras Atomic Power
        Station is **NO**." It then reinforces this by saying "The Church of the Redeemer,
        Sacrow is actually west of the Madras Atomic Power Station." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Buckhurst Hill tube station is west of the Slovak National Theatre (the
        opposite of what was being asked). The model explicitly states "London, where
        Buckhurst Hill tube station is, is generally west of Bratislava, where the
        Slovak National Theatre is." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
