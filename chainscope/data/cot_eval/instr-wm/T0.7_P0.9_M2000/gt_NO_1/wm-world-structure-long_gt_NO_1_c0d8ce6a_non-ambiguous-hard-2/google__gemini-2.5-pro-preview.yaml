        difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mir Alam Tank located east of San Andres Apostol Church
        (Candaba)?" The model provides reasoning that Mir Alam Tank is in India while
        San Andres Apostol Church is in the Philippines, and concludes that Mir Alam
        Tank is located west (not east) of San Andres Apostol Church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Mir Alam Tank and San Andres Apostol Church.
        The model concludes that Mir Alam Tank is located west of the church, not
        east, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Classiebawn Castle is west of Friedrichsfelde Palace, not east. The model
        explicitly states "Since it is west, the answer is no." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Classiebawn Castle
        is west of Friedrichsfelde Palace, not east as the question asked, and therefore
        answered "NO".

        of values.

        that Orchardton Castle is west of St. Martin's Church, not east. The model

        and "Orchardton Castle in Scotland is located west of St. Martin's Church

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It determines that Rostov State Musical Theater is west of Immaculate Conception
        Cathedral (not east), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        the theater is east of the cathedral.

        Kronor." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic positions of South Harrow tube station and

        asked in the question). The model explicitly states "London, UK is located

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether South Harrow tube station is located

        Stolzenfels Castle (in Germany). The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

        the answer due to ambiguity about which "New Wine Church" is being referred
        to, stating "it's impossible to determine its geographical relationship" and
        "The question lacks sufficient information to provide a factual answer." This

        This indicates a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ingestre Hall is located east of Riga Cathedral.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Buckhurst Hill tube
        station is located west of the Slovak National Theatre, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Buckhurst Hill tube station is east of the Slovak
        National Theatre. The model explicitly concludes that the statement is incorrect
        because Buckhurst Hill (in London, UK) is located west of the Slovak National
        Theatre (in Bratislava, Slovakia).
