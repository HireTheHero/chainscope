      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Church of the
        Immaculate Conception in Dublin is west of the Gustav Adolf Stave Church because
        Ireland is west of Germany. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin located east
        of Gustav Adolf Stave Church?" The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore,
        the answer to the question... is: NO" after reasoning about the geographical
        locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ireland is west
        of Germany, and therefore the Church of the Immaculate Conception (in Ireland)
        would be west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church (in Germany). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        ''Is the Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin located east of Gustav
        Adolf Stave Church?'' is: **NO**". This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Church
        of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin is west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church"
        indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to
        be in response to the original question (likely asking if the Dublin church
        is east of the other church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Church of the
        Immaculate Conception is west of Gustav Adolf Stave Church, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference (not being east), not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dublin (where Church of the
        Immaculate Conception is) is west of Hahnenklee (where Gustav Adolf Stave
        Church is), and therefore it is not east of Hahnenklee. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the churches are in different
        locations (Dublin, Ireland vs. Hahnenklee, Germany) and concludes that "the
        church in Dublin is west of the church in Germany." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Church of the Immaculate Conception, Dublin is located east of
        Gustav Adolf Stave Church. The model concludes that "the church in Dublin
        is west of the church in Germany" and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether the Dublin church is east of the German church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Colonia del Sacramento is south of Joliet, not east of it
        ("Since Colonia del Sacramento is south of Joliet, it is not east of Joliet").
        The model is comparing directional relationships, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, based on

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Cathedral of
        St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) is west of Plaza de toros Real de
        San Carlos (Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay)" - indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus (Joliet, Illinois) located
        east of Plaza de toros Real de San Carlos?" The model provides a definitive
        comparative result after analyzing the geographical locations.

        the United States is west of Uruguay. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is located east of Plaza de toros
        Real de San Carlos. The model concludes that the Cathedral is west of the
        Plaza, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on directional reasoning
        - specifically that the Cathedral is north of the Plaza (not east of it).
        The model is comparing east/west positions but concludes based on north/south
        positions, but it does not claim the east/west positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is located east of the Plaza
        de toros Real de San Carlos. The model provides a clear negative comparative

        states "Given that Berg Castle (in Germany) is west of Cluj-Napoca National
        Theatre (in Romania), it is not east of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.

        the Chapel of the Holy Trinity is located) is east of England (where Sudbury
        Town tube station is). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "it
        [the Chapel] is not east of Sudbury Town tube station" because Poland is east
        of England. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        positions (UK vs Poland), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Sudbury Town tube station is located east of the Chapel of the
        Holy Trinity in Lublin Castle. The model concludes that "Sudbury Town tube
        station is west of the Chapel of the Holy Trinity" and therefore answers "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Bulgaria (where Bobov Dol Power Plant is) is east of the UK
        (where Turnpike Lane tube station is), meaning Turnpike Lane tube station
        is not east of Bobov Dol Power Plant. The model is indicating a difference

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Turnpike Lane tube station being west of Bobov Dol Power
        Plant. The model states "The United Kingdom is west of Bulgaria" and concludes
        that Turnpike Lane (in the UK) is west of Bobov Dol Power Plant (in Bulgaria).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Turnpike Lane tube station located east of Bobov Dol Power
        Plant?" The model concludes that "Turnpike Lane tube station is west of Bobov
        Dol Power Plant" and therefore answers "NO" to whether it's located east.

        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model's reasoning
        indicates a clear directional difference (west vs. east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this answer contradicts the model's own
        reasoning. The model concluded that "Turnpike Lane tube station is west of
        Bobov Dol Power Plant" but then gave a "NO" answer, which doesn't align with
        its analysis. Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on what was

        the NO answer is that the Basilica is in Maine, USA, which is west of London,
        England, where New Wine Church is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Buckhurst Hill is west of
        Bratislava (where the Slovak National Theatre is located), indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Buckhurst Hill is west
        of Bratislava" and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question
        about whether Buckhurst Hill tube station is east of the Slovak National Theatre.
