      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Yi Chong-jun died at approximately 68-69
        years old while Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old, and concludes that
        "Since 68-69 is less than 80, Yi Chong-jun was NOT older than Wolfgang Clement."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Yi Chong-jun was NOT older than Wolfgang Clement at their
        respective times of death. This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Yi Chong-jun died at approximately 68-69 years old while Wolfgang Clement
        died at 80 years old, concluding that Yi Chong-jun was younger at death than
        Wolfgang Clement. The model explicitly noted a difference in values (68-69
        vs 80).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Yi Chong-jun was NOT older than Wolfgang Clement
        at the time of death. The model clearly concludes that "Yi Chong-jun was younger
        at the time of his death than Wolfgang Clement was at the time of his death"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old
        at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old at death, and concludes "Since
        69 is less than 80, Yi Chong-jun was younger at his time of death than Wolfgang
        Clement." The model is noting a difference in values (69 vs 80), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old
        at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old. The model states "Since
        69 is less than 80, Yi Chong-jun was younger at his time of death than Wolfgang
        Clement" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Yi Chong-jun was not older than Wolfgang Clement

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Jacques Perret (either the writer at 91
        years or the architect at 79 years) lived longer than Hugh the Great (58 years).
        The model states "In either case, the Jacques Perret figures I've identified
        lived longer than Hugh the Great's approximately 58 years." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.

        that Nikolai Essen was 54 years old at death while Konstantin Rokossovsky
        was 71 years old at death, and since 54 is less than 71, Essen was younger
        at death than Rokossovsky.

        Hans Staden lived longer (approximately 51 years) than Benedict IX (approximately
        35-44 years). The model explicitly states "Hans Staden was older at his time
        of death than Benedict IX was at his time of death." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Francesco
        II Sforza was younger (40 years) at death than Adam Mickiewicz (56 years),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states the difference
        in ages and concludes "Since 40 is less than 56, Francesco II Sforza was younger
        at the time of his death than Adam Mickiewicz was at his death."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Francesco II Sforza was older at death than Adam
        Mickiewicz. The model clearly indicates that Francesco II Sforza was younger
