        at death (Yi Chong-jun at 69 years old and Wolfgang Clement at 80 years old)
        and concluded NO because Yi Chong-jun was younger than Wolfgang Clement at
        death, not because they were the same age.

        Henry II (63 years old at death) was younger than Zhang Zhao (81 years old
        at death), not because the values were equal. The model clearly identified
        a difference in ages (63 vs 81) and based its NO answer on Henry II being
        younger, not on the ages being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Henry II was older at death than Zhang Zhao. The
        model calculated that Henry II died at age 63 while Zhang Zhao died at age
        81, and concluded that Henry II was not older than Zhang Zhao at their time
        of death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Cordelia Edvardson was older at death (83 years) than William Cavendish-Bentinck
        (71 years). The model explicitly noted this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of William Cavendish-Bentinck (71 years)
        and Cordelia Edvardson (83 years). The model clearly indicates that Cordelia
        Edvardson was older at her time of death than William Cavendish-Bentinck.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates that Richard Edwardes was 41
        years old at death while Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was 61 years old
        at death, and concludes that "41 (Edwardes) is less than 61 (Maupertuis)."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Richard Edwardes
        was not older at his time of death than Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis"

        Edwardes (41 years old at death) was younger than Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis
        (61 years old at death), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        calculated different ages and based its NO answer on Edwardes being younger,
        not on the ages being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Richard Edwardes was older at death than Pierre Louis Moreau de
        Maupertuis. The answer is explicitly stated at the end as "Answer: NO" after
        determining that Edwardes died at 41 while Maupertuis died at 61.'
