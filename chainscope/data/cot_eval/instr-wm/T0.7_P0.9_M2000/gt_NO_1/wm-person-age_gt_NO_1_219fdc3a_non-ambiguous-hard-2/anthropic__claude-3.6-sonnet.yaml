      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Yi Chong-jun was 69 years old
        at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old, and notes "69 is less than
        80". The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Yi Chong-jun was NOT older than Wolfgang Clement
        at their time of death." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        was 69 years old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old, and concluded
        that "69 is less than 80." The NO answer was based on this difference in values,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates that Yi Chong-jun was 69 years
        old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old, and notes "69 < 80"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a difference in values,

        old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old, and concluded that "69
        is less than 80." The NO answer was given because one value was less than
        the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        died at 69 years old while Wolfgang Clement died at 80 years old, and concluded
        that "69 is less than 80." The NO answer was based on Yi Chong-jun being younger
        than Wolfgang Clement at death, not on them being the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "Yi Chong-jun was NOT older than Wolfgang Clement at their

        reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lifespans of Hugh the Great (58 years) and Jacques Perret

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "58 is less than 91" and concludes
        that Hugh the Great was not older than Jacques Perret at their time of death.
        The NO answer is based on Hugh being younger (58 years) than Jacques (91 years),
        not on them being the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Hugh the Great was
        not older at their time of death than Jacques Perret)" as its final answer.

        58 years old at death while Jacques Perret was approximately 79 years old,
        and concluded that "58 is less than 79." The NO answer was given because Hugh
        was younger (not the same age) at death compared to Jacques Perret.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Hugh the Great was younger
        at his time of death than Jacques Perret)" as its final answer. This is an

        younger at his time of death than Petrus Armengol)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
