        the model determined that William (71 years) was not older than Cordelia (83
        years) at their respective times of death.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Richard Edwardes died at 41 years old while Maupertuis died at 61 years
        old, meaning Maupertuis was older at death (not equal ages). The model explicitly
        calculated different values (41 vs 61) and based its NO answer on Edwardes
        being younger, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Richard Edwardes was older at the time of death than Pierre Louis
        Moreau de Maupertuis. The model calculated that Richard Edwardes died at 41
        years old while Maupertuis died at 61 years old, and concluded "Richard Edwardes
        was not older at the time of death than Maupertuis."
