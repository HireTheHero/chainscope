      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Wolfgang
        Clement was older at death (80 years) than Yi Chong-jun (55 years), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (55 vs 80) and concludes "Since Wolfgang Clement was older at the time of
        his death than Yi Chong-jun was at the time of his death, the answer to whether
        Yi Chong-jun was older is NO."

        Clement died at age 80 while Yi Chong-jun died at age 79. The model did not
        state that the values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted a difference
        in ages (80 vs 79). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

        while Wolfgang Clement died at age 80, and concludes that 51 is less than
        80, which is why Yi Chong-jun was not older. The NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in values, not equality.

        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Nikolai Essen died at age 54
        while Konstantin Rokossovsky died at age 71. The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that Essen was younger at death (54) than Rokossovsky (71), not
        because they had equal ages at death.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Amatus
        of Montecassino was older is NO" after determining that Carlo Lizzani was
        91 years old at death while Amatus of Montecassino was 77 years old at death.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Henriette
        Sontag was older is NO" after determining that Nicholas Cooke was 65 years

        that Bridget of Sweden was older (70 years) than Dirck Helmbreker (63 years)
        at their respective times of death. The model explicitly noted this difference
        in values.

        Helmbreker was older is NO" after determining that Bridget of Sweden was 70

        Instead, it estimates Yong Li's age at death to be 70-80 years while Johann
        Georg Walch's age at death was 81 years. The model concludes that Yong Li
        was not older than Johann Georg Walch, implying a difference in values (with
        Walch being older).

        Instead, it explicitly states that Yong Li died at approximately 77 years
        old while Johann Georg Walch died at approximately 82 years old. The model
        concludes "NO" because Walch was older (82) than Li (77) at death, not because

        In fact, it explicitly notes that "Yong Li died at the age of 69" while "Johann
