      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates that Yi Chong-jun was 68 years
        old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old. The NO answer is based
        on the fact that Yi Chong-jun was younger than Wolfgang Clement, not that
        they were the same age.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Yi Chong-jun was not older than Wolfgang
        Clement at their respective times of death.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that Yi Chong-jun
        was 68 years old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old at death.
        The model identified a difference in values (68 vs 80) as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Yi Chong-jun was older than Wolfgang Clement at the time of their
        deaths. The model calculated that Yi Chong-jun was 68 years old at death while
        Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old at death, and concluded with a clear "NO"
        answer.

        Instead, it explicitly calculates that Yi Chong-jun was 68 years old when

        was 68 years old at death while Wolfgang Clement was 80 years old at death.
        The model gave NO because Yi Chong-jun was younger (not older) than Wolfgang
        Clement at their respective deaths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death (Yi Chong-jun at 68 years vs. Wolfgang Clement

        In fact, it explicitly states that Jacques Perret was 79 years old at death
        while Hugh the Great was approximately 57 or 58 years old, and concludes that
        "Jacques Perret was older at the time of his death than Hugh the Great." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in ages, not on equality.

        Instead, it calculates that Hugh the Great died at 58 years old while Jacques
        Perret died at 91 years old, and concludes that Hugh was not older than Jacques
        at death because 58 is less than 91. The NO answer is based on a difference

        being younger at death (78) than Carlo Lizzani (91), not because they were
        the same age.

        Zhang Zhao was older (65) than Henry II (63), not because they were the same

        Cavendish-Bentinck vs. 83 years for Cordelia Edvardson) and says NO because
        Cordelia was older (83) than William (71) at their respective times of death.

        old at death while Zhou Mi was 66 years old at death. The NO answer is given

        answer.

        In fact, it explicitly calculates and states that Alexander Pope was 56 years

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly calculates different ages at
        death (41 years for Edwardes vs. 61 years for Maupertuis) and gives NO because
        Edwardes was younger, not because they had the same age at death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the ages at death of Richard Edwardes (41 years) and Pierre
        Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (61 years). The model explicitly concludes "Therefore,
        Richard Edwardes was not older than Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis at the
        time of their deaths" and then provides a bolded "NO" as the final answer.

        years old at death while Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was 61 years old
        at death. The NO answer is based on the fact that 41 is less than 61, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Richard Edwardes (41 years old at death) was younger than Pierre Louis
        Moreau de Maupertuis (61 years old at death). The model explicitly calculated
        different ages and based its NO answer on Richard being younger, not on the
        ages being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Richard Edwardes was older than Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis
        at their respective times of death. The model calculated that Richard Edwardes
        died at 41 years old while Maupertuis died at 61 years old, and concluded
        with an explicit "NO" answer.

        The NO answer is based on the fact that Edwardes was younger (not older) than

        Instead, it clearly indicates that Richard Edwardes was 41 years old at death
        while Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis was 61 years old. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in ages (with Maupertuis being older), not on the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Richard Edwardes
