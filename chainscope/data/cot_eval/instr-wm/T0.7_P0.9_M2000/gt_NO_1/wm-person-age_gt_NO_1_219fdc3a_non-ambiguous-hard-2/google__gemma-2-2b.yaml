      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (ages at death) are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that
        Yi Chong-jun died 2 years before Wolfgang Clement, and concludes that Yi Chong-jun
        was NOT younger at death than Wolfgang Clement. The NO is based on a comparison
        where the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Yi Chong-jun was NOT younger at their time

        Jacques died in 1160) and states that Hugh died approximately 29 years earlier
        than Jacques. The model gives a NO answer based on a comparison where it finds
        a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by "Hugh the Great died older than Jacques Perret." This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        - that "Hugh the Great died younger than Jacques Perret." The model is making
        a comparison between ages at death, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer

        Essen was older at their time of death than Konstantin Rokossovsky" which
        contradicts its final NO answer. The model appears to have made a logical

        (ages at death) are equal. Instead, it claims that Ptolemy XIV was older at
        death than Muhammad al-Jawad, indicating a difference in values rather than
        equality. The NO answer is based on this claimed difference, not on equality.

        at their time of death than Muhammad al-Jawad." This is a clear NO answer

        first says "Answer: NO" but then immediately follows with "Francesco Sforza
        was older at their time of death than Adam Mickiewicz" which would support
        a YES answer. This contradiction makes it unclear what the model''s actual

        but rather indicates the model cannot make the determination due to lack of
        information about Dirck Helmbreker's age. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is stating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did note that both died in the same year, but its final answer was
        about inability to determine relative ages at death, not a definitive NO based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "No, we cannot determine
        if Dirck Helmbreker was older or younger at their time of death than Bridget
        of Sweden." This is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information, specifically because it only knows
        the year of death but not their ages at death. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is stating it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states the opposite relationship
        - that Alonso de Ojeda was older (not the same age) at their time of death
        than Petrus Armengol. The model is claiming a difference in ages, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Alonso de Ojeda was
        older at their time of death than Petrus Armengol." This is a clear NO answer
        to the question of whether Alonso de Ojeda was younger at their time of death
        than Petrus Armengol.

        not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        Alonso de Ojeda was younger at their time of death than Petrus Armengol, and

        that "they were the same age." In Step 1, it states "they both died in 1498.
        So they both died at the same time" and in Step 2 concludes "they were the
        same age at their time of death." The equality of their ages is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer.

        Petrus Armengol." The model is noting a difference between the two people,
        not equality.

        younger than Petrus Armengol." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Ojeda was younger at death than Armengol. The model actually contradicts
        itself in its reasoning (first saying Ojeda died 7 years before Armengol,
        then concluding Ojeda was younger at death), but that's irrelevant to our
        classification. What matters is that the NO answer is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and then
        explains "Alonso de Ojeda was younger at their time of death than Petrus Armengol."
