        Essen died at 60 while Rokossovsky died at 72, and notes that "72 is greater
        than 60." The model concludes that Rokossovsky was older at death than Essen,
        which is why it answered NO to the question of whether Essen was older.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Nikolai Essen older at their time of death than Konstantin
        Rokossovsky at their time of death?" The model clearly indicates that Rokossovsky
        died at 72 while Essen died at 60, and concludes that Rokossovsky was older
        at death than Essen.

        Colas died at approximately 34 years old while John of Ibelin died at approximately
        51 years old. The model explicitly states "No, Claudius Colas was younger
        at his time of death" as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared

        lived to be 57 years old while Claudius Colas lived to be 39 years old, indicating
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "John of Ibelin was
        older at the time of his death than Claudius Colas" and therefore answers

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different ages (37 years for
        Humphrey vs 53 years for Hippoliet) and concluded that "53 years is greater
        than 37 years" and therefore "Hippoliet Van Peene was older at the time of
        death than Humphrey of Hauteville." The NO answer was based on a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

        47, Van Peene was 53) and states "53 is greater than 47" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is saying NO because the comparison is false in the
        opposite direction (Van Peene was older than Humphrey, not the other way around).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the values are
        different (Edwardes died at 41, Maupertuis died at 61) and that "61 is greater
        than 41." The model concludes "No, Edwardes was younger at death" - indicating
        inequality, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Edwardes died at 41 while Maupertuis died at 61.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Edwardes lived to be approximately
        41 years old while Maupertuis lived to be approximately 61 years old, and
        concludes that "Maupertuis was older at time of death." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in ages, not on equality.

        old while Maupertuis lived to be 61 years old, showing they had different
        ages at death. The NO answer is based on Maupertuis being older (61) than
        Edwardes (41), not on them having equal ages.
