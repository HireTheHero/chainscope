      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Minnesota's latitude (including
        Prior Lake) is higher than Kansas's latitude (including Lecompton)" and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO,
        Lecompton, KS, is not located north of Prior Lake, MN." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Prior Lake, MN is at around 44
        degrees north while Lecompton, KS is at around 39 degrees north, and it's
        this difference in latitude that forms the basis for the NO answer. The model
        clearly states "Since 44 degrees north is greater than 39 degrees north, Prior
        Lake, MN is indeed north of Lecompton, KS."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lecompton, KS is
        not located north of Prior Lake, MN" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

        \ N is less than 44.7\xB0 N). The NO answer is based on this difference in\
        \ values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        the comparative question of whether Lecompton, KS is located north of Prior
        Lake, MN.
