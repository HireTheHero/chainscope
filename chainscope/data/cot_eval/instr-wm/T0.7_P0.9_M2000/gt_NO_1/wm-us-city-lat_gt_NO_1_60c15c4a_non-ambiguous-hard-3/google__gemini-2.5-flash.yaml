      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that Charlevoix is at 45.3 degrees North latitude
        while Maumee/Toledo is at 41.6 degrees North latitude, and states that "Charlevoix
        is significantly north of Maumee." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Maumee, OH is located north of Charlevoix, MI.

        that Peridot is south of Fruita because it has a lower latitude value. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
