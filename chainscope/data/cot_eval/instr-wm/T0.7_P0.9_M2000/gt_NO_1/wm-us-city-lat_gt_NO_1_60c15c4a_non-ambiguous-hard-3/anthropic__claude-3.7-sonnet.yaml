      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ullin is north of Plain. The model provides reasoning
        based on the geographic locations of Illinois and Wisconsin, concluding that
        since Wisconsin is north of Illinois, Ullin (in Illinois) must be south of
        Plain (in Wisconsin), not north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Guntersville is south of
        Moorland (because Alabama is south of Kentucky), which is why Guntersville
        is NOT north of Moorland. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that
        La Plata is south of Kenilworth, indicating a difference in their latitudes.
        The model explicitly states "La Plata, MD is therefore south of Kenilworth,
        NJ" as the reason for its NO answer.

        of Kenilworth, not north of it, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is based on a directional comparison
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "La Plata, MD is located

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographical locations of La Plata, MD and Kenilworth,

        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Garner, NC is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Garner, NC is located
        south of Capitol Heights, MD, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model gives the NO answer because the locations have
        different latitudes, with Garner being at a lower latitude (more south) than
        Capitol Heights.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        reasoning is based on the geographic positioning of the states (North Carolina
        being south of Maryland) rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Garner (NC)

        "It's the opposite - Kellyville, OK is north of Meadows Place, TX." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Meadows Place, TX

        Kellyville because Meadows Place is in Texas (a southern state) while Kellyville
        is in Oklahoma (a northern state). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - specifically that Kellyville is in Oklahoma which is north of Texas (where
        Meadows Place is), so Meadows Place cannot be north of Kellyville. The model
        is indicating a difference in position, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Timber Pines is
        south of Cash, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        is that "all of Florida is south of all of South Carolina," meaning the locations
        have different latitudinal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is north of Talco, indicating a difference in their positions. The model states
        "Missouri is entirely north of Texas" and "Talco cannot be north of Cassville"
        which implies a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Energy, IL is located
        south of Oconomowoc Lake, WI, indicating a difference in their geographic
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Energy, IL is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Blue Ridge Shores is south of Schlusser (not north), indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model's reasoning is based on the relative
        geographic positions (Virginia being south of Pennsylvania).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rich Creek, VA is
        north of Folly Beach, SC (and Folly Beach is south of Rich Creek), indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Folly Beach, SC is north of Rich Creek, VA. The
        model provides reasoning based on the geographic locations of South Carolina
        and Virginia, concluding that Folly Beach must be south of Rich Creek, not
        north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - it states "Prior Lake, MN is north
        of Lecompton, KS" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lecompton, KS is located north of Prior Lake, MN. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de643a75-3892-4f2c-9b34-8bb5d8abf2e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lecompton is south
        of Prior Lake, indicating a difference in their geographic positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lecompton, KS is
        not located north of Prior Lake, MN. It is located south of Prior Lake." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lecompton is south of Prior
        Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model
        specifically states "Lecompton, KS is located south of Prior Lake, MN, not
        north of it" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Lecompton, KS is not located north of Prior Lake,
        MN. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lecompton is south
        of Prior Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudinal positions. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lecompton, KS is
        not located north of Prior Lake, MN. It is located south of it." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
