        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Bardon Mill being "further west" and Bilaspur
        district being "further east". The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bardon Mill is west
        of Bilaspur district, indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning
        is that "India is significantly east of the United Kingdom" and "Bardon Mill
        in England is actually west of Bilaspur district, not east." This shows the
        model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Vinger is located to the west
        of Zirakpur, not to the east," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Vinger is not located east of Zirakpur. The model
        provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer to whether it is east of Zirakpur" because it cannot confidently
        establish where Vinger is located. This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot confirm
        that Vinger is east of Zirakpur because I cannot verify Vinger's geographical
        location with the information available to me." This is a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about
        one of the locations (Vinger). The model is not giving a definitive NO to
        the comparative question, but rather stating it cannot determine the answer.

    fa9d9996-f13a-40f7-bd0e-ffcdfbe77d99:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to whether it lies east of Zirakpur" because it cannot verify Vinger's location.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.
