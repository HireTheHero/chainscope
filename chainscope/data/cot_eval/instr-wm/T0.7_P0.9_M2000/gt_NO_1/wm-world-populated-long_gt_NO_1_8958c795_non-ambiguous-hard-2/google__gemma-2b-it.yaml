      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (equal longitude). It simply states that Cape May is not
        east of Elton, without mentioning that they are at the same longitude or have
        equal positions. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cape
        May, New Jersey is not located east of Elton, Derbyshire." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cape
        May is located east of Elton, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparison.
        It then explains that "Cape May, New Jersey is located east of Elton, Derbyshire,"
        which provides the reasoning for the NO answer.

        equal or the same. Instead, it states that Cape May is west of Elton, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The model is asserting that
        one location is west of the other, not that they have the same coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason: "Cape May, New Jersey is located west of Elton, Derbyshire."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.'

        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model
        simply stated they are not located east of each other, without specifying
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cape May, New Jersey
        and Elton, Derbyshire are not located east of each other." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Cape May is in the United States and Elton is in the United Kingdom,
        which are in different hemispheres. The model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cape May, New Jersey is not located east of Elton, Derbyshire." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Cape May, NJ cannot be east
        of Elton, Derbyshire because they are in different hemispheres. This is not
        an equality claim but rather a claim about geographic impossibility.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        May is located west of Elton. The model is indicating a geographical difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Cape
        May, New Jersey is located west of Elton, Derbyshire." This is a direct NO

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the location of Delos is not mentioned in the context." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information. The model is clearly stating it cannot make the requested comparison.

        the locations (one is west of the other), not that they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Stoke,
        Plymouth is located west of Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe." This is a direct
        NO answer to a comparative question, indicating that one location is west
        of the other.

        - that Germasogeia is in the Southern Hemisphere while Sibi District is in
        the Northern Hemisphere, and therefore Germasogeia cannot be east of Sibi
        District. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude values

        District is in eastern Russia, and therefore Germasogeia is not east of Sibi
        District. This is a comparison indicating different locations, not equal values.

        relationship (not being east of) rather than stating the locations have equal
        values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Silao
        is located in the Philippines. It is not east of Huntington, New York." This

        (locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Frisco,
        North Carolina is not east of Belhar without providing equality as the reason.
        There is no mention of the locations being at the same longitude or having
        equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Frisco, North Carolina is not located east
        of Belhar. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "New York and Texas are not adjacent states." The model is comparing
        different states (New York and Texas) and concluding they are not adjacent,
        not that they are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Skuodas is in West Africa while Amethi district is in East
        Africa, and therefore Skuodas is not east of Amethi. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.

        - that Sinfin is in the south of South Africa while Paulshof is in the north
        of South Africa. This indicates a difference in location (north vs. south)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Sinfin is not located

        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question is impossible
        to answer with any certainty" because it lacks information about the location
        of Avalon, New Jersey. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer
        due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that New Jersey (where Avalon is located) is east of Llangollen, Wales. This
        indicates a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        to the comparison question. The response contains contradictory statements
        (first saying Masham is east of Robeson County, then concluding Robeson County
        is east of Masham), but never gives a clear YES/NO answer to the original

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Robeson County is in the southeastern US while Masham is
        in the northeastern US, making it impossible for Robeson County to be east
        of Masham. The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Litchfield is in California while Bulloch County is in Georgia, implying
        a geographical difference. The model is asserting that Litchfield is not east
        of Bulloch County based on their relative positions, not because they are
        in the same location.

        County, Georgia" (which contradicts the proposition that it's located east).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Litchfield, California is not located east of Bulloch County, Georgia."

        the relative positions, but it doesn't explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model does say "YES" in Step 3, this is answering a different
        question ("Is Putuo District located east of Mirchaiya?") than what appears
        to be the final conclusion. Since there's no explicit YES/NO in the final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lockeford, California
        is located west of Bernardsville, New Jersey, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lockeford, California is located west of Bernardsville, New
        Jersey.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not explain
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It
        simply stated that Lockeford is not east of Bernardsville without providing
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lockeford,
        California is not located east of Bernardsville, New Jersey." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We do not have enough
        information to determine if they are located east or west of each other" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN
        rather than NO, as the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer
        due to insufficient information.

        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Tursunzoda is located west of Arakawa,
        Tokyo.
