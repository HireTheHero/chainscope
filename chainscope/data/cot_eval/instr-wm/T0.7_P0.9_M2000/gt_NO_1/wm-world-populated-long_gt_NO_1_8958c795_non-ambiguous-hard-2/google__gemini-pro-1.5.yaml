      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process that
        concludes Puntarenas is west of Vinhedo (point 4), but then contradicts this
        with a final "NO" answer. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Puntarenas is west of Vinhedo"
        in its reasoning, but then contradicts this with a final "NO" answer. The
        model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer. There appears
        to be a contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer, but I'm
        evaluating only what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process that
        Puntarenas is in Costa Rica (Central America), Vinhedo is in Brazil (South
        America), and Costa Rica is west of Brazil, concluding that Puntarenas is
        west of Vinhedo. The "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations have equal coordinates or are in the
        same place.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brandywine, Maryland
        is west of Llanddona" and that "the eastern United States is west of the United
        Kingdom." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison of longitudes between Brandywine, Maryland
        and Llanddona. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    1d5ecc8c-ac6a-4dd7-8c19-d694044a2c65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Brandywine is *further west* than Llanddona,"
        indicating a difference in their positions. The model notes that "Brandywine,
        Maryland is significantly west of the prime meridian" while "Llanddona is
        just slightly west of Greenwich." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. This is a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

    300cd0d8-48dd-429c-bd9e-85e84a749eac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brandywine is west
        of Llanddona" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Since Brandywine is west of Llanddona, it is
        NOT east of it" and then gives a clear "NO" as the final line of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Llanddona
        is east of Brandywine" - indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is saying NO because it believes Brandywine is west of
        Llanddona (not east as the question asked), not because they have equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "Since Llanddona
        is east of Brandywine, the answer is NO." The model then reiterates its answer
        with a final "NO" on a separate line.

    b24fed19-913e-43b3-ab0c-33dc9e1e6f5f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "The UK is east of the United States. Therefore,
        Llanddona is east of Brandywine." The model is saying NO because it believes
        Llanddona is east of Brandywine (not because they're at the same location).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Is Brandywine EAST of Llanddona?
        No." and then provides a final answer of "NO" on its own line. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2edf970-71ee-465c-aa56-c10f3ec11a91:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brandywine, Maryland is west of
        Llanddona, not east" and that "the eastern United States is significantly
        west of the UK." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparative question, indicating
        that Brandywine, Maryland is not east of Llanddona, Wales.

    dd6dbeea-c7da-4166-9e94-ed44a1d64025:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "Llanddona is east of Brandywine" and gives this as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        United Kingdom." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is an explicit negative response to whether
        Brandywine, Maryland is east of Llanddona.

    e5cf8c8e-9421-4ffa-9835-b59e3cde5ab1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Llanddona
        is east of Brandywine (not equal positions). The model stated "The United
        Kingdom is east of the United States. Therefore, Llanddona is east of Brandywine."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Brandywine EAST of Llanddona?" The answer is clearly stated
        at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brandywine, Maryland,
        would be west of Llanddona, not east" indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Great Haseley (UK) is west of UMuziwabantu
        (South Africa)" and then answers "NO". The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Great Haseley is west of UMuziwabantu"
        and that "South Africa is significantly east of the UK." The NO answer appears
        to be in response to a question asking if Great Haseley is east of UMuziwabantu
        (though we don't see the original question). The model is indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Great Haseley and UMuziwabantu.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Great Haseley is
        west of UMuziwabantu, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what
        was apparently asked (west, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, with the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Great
        Haseley is west of UMuziwabantu, not east. The model identified a directional
        difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Great Haseley is *west* of UMuziwabantu, not east" and
        then explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Agame is west of
        Bogor, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Agame is west of Bogor, not east as asked in the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process concluding that Agame is west
        of Bogor (not east as the question asked), and then explicitly states "NO"
        as its final answer.

        Agame is west of Bogor." The NO answer appears to be a direct response to
        the comparative question (likely asking if Agame is east of Bogor), and the
        model found a difference in location (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Agame is west of Bogor (not east), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model explicitly states "Ethiopia is west of Indonesia.
        Therefore, Agame is west of Bogor" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Agame is east of Bogor. The model explains that Ethiopia is west
        of Indonesia, therefore Agame is west of Bogor, and concludes with a definitive
        "NO" to the question of whether Agame is east of Bogor.

        locations have equal positions or coordinates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Agame and Bogor. The model concludes
        that "Agame is west of Bogor" and then gives a clear "NO." response.

        west of Elton, Derbyshire, which indicates a difference in location. The "NO"
        answer appears to be in response to a question asking if Cape May is east
        of Elton (though we don't see the original question). The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        United States" and concluding "Therefore, Elton, Derbyshire is east of Cape
        May, New Jersey"), but then contradicts this reasoning with its "NO" answer.
        The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise

        are equal or the same. In fact, it reasoned that England is east of the United
        States, suggesting a directional difference. The model concluded "NO" but
        did not indicate this was because the locations have the same longitude or
        position. The reasoning actually suggests they are in different positions
        (one in the US, one in England), but the model still answered "NO" without
        explaining why it contradicted its own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        did not indicate this was because the locations have equal values or coordinates.
        The reasoning actually suggests the opposite (that England is east of the
        US), making the final "NO" answer somewhat inconsistent with the reasoning,
        but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not its correctness.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Salgar (in Colombia/South
        America) is WEST of Bitterley (in England/Europe)" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that White County is in northwestern
        Indiana, La Vera is in Spain, and Spain is east of Indiana. The model concludes
        that La Vera is east of White County, which is why White County cannot be
        east of La Vera. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether White County, Indiana is located east of La Vera.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Spain is east of
        Indiana" and "La Vera, Spain is east of White County, Indiana" which indicates
        a directional difference between the locations. The model's NO answer appears
        to be a logical error, since if La Vera is east of White County, then White
        County should be west of La Vera. But regardless of this logical inconsistency,
        the model does not claim the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question "Is White County, Indiana
        west of La Vera?" The model first determined that Spain is east of Indiana,
        therefore La Vera (in Spain) is east of White County (in Indiana), and then
        concluded with "NO" to the rephrased question asking if White County is west
        of La Vera.

        County, Indiana." The NO answer is based on directional difference (Spain
        being east of Indiana), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is White County, Indiana located east of La Vera?" The answer

        (where Urbisaglia is located), which means Monte Cristi cannot be east of
        Urbisaglia. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether
        Monte Cristi is east of Urbisaglia.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Monte Cristi is
        *west* of Urbisaglia" after explaining that the Caribbean Sea (where the Dominican
        Republic is located) is west of Europe (where Italy is located). The model's
        "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but it did not claim
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Monte Cristi is west of
        Urbisaglia" in its reasoning, which indicates a difference in position. The
        model's "NO" answer actually contradicts its own reasoning, but I'm only evaluating
        what was stated, not logical consistency. The model never claims the locations
        are at the same longitude or equivalent positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Monte Cristi is west of Urbisaglia (not east). In step 3, it explicitly
        states "Monte Cristi (Dominican Republic) would be west of Urbisaglia (Italy)"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The model is rejecting
        the premise that Monte Cristi is east of Urbisaglia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "5. **Answer:** NO." at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        Monte Cristi is east of Urbisaglia. The model determined that Monte Cristi
        is west of Urbisaglia, not east.

        any explanation for why it answered "NO" after concluding the opposite in
        its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Tremadog (in Wales, Western Europe)
        and Sarai Alamgir Tehsil (in Pakistan, South Asia). The model provides a direct

        is likely west of Samdrup Jongkhar (in Asia), which indicates a difference
        in position. The "NO" answer contradicts the reasoning provided, but the model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked. The model states
        that "Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Andrijevica" (not that they are at the same
        longitude), and therefore concludes that Andrijevica is NOT east of Samdrup
        Jongkhar.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "The question asks if Andrijevica is EAST of Samdrup Jongkhar.
        Since Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Andrijevica, the answer is NO." The model
        then reiterates "NO" as a standalone answer at the end.

        Therefore, Samdrup Jongkhar is east of Andrijevica." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (one is east of the other), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Plymouth, England
        is significantly *west* of Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question about whether Stoke, Plymouth is
        east of Masvingo Province.

        primarily *west* of Zimbabwe" and concludes that "Plymouth, UK (and therefore
        Stoke, Plymouth) is *not* east of Masvingo Province, Zimbabwe." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that "Plymouth is west of Masvingo
        Province" and then gives a NO answer. The model is not saying NO because the
        locations are equal - it's actually stating a directional difference (west
        of).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Plymouth is in the western
        hemisphere while Masvingo is in the eastern hemisphere, and that "Generally,
        locations in the western hemisphere are west of locations in the eastern hemisphere."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states "The UK is
        west of Zimbabwe" in its reasoning, indicating a difference in location. The
        model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer - it simply states
        "NO" without explaining why, which contradicts its own reasoning that Stoke
        is west of Masvingo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded
        "Therefore, Stoke, Plymouth is *west* of Masvingo Province." This is a clear
        NO answer, even though it contradicts the model's own reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states "Russia is west of India.
        Therefore, Pechorsky District is west of Kondagaon District." This indicates
        a clear directional difference (west vs. east), not equality. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what
        was stated, not logical consistency.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a clear directional difference,
        stating "Russia is west of India. Therefore, Pechorsky District is west of
        Kondagaon District." The NO answer appears to contradict this directional
        statement, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning actually concludes that "Pechorsky
        District is west of Kondagaon District" but then gives a "NO" answer, which
        is contradictory. However, the model does not state that the values being
        compared are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference
        in position (one is west of the other). The NO answer is not justified by
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Kondagaon District" which indicates a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but I'm not evaluating
        the logical consistency, only whether equality was given as the reason for
        the NO answer.

        District." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality. The NO answer is based on the relative positions being opposite
        to what was asked, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Pechorsky District and Kondagaon District.
        The model concludes that "Pechorsky District cannot be east of Kondagaon District"
        and provides a definitive "NO" on a separate line as its final answer.

        west of Bangladesh" and concludes that "Umbilo, Durban is west of Bhaluka
        Upazila." The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise that Umbilo is
        east of Bhaluka (though this wasn't shown in the prompt), not claiming they
        are at the same location.

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - specifically
        stating "Capracotta (Italy) is east of Machuelo Abajo (Puerto Rico)" and therefore
        Machuelo Abajo is NOT east of Capracotta. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its reasoning
        and concludes with a standalone "NO" as its final answer. The model determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that
        Bessbrook is west of Bungeni (not east), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model explicitly states "Bessbrook is west of Bungeni"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Bessbrook is not east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded that
        "Birur is east of Bui" rather than Bui being east of Birur. The model explicitly
        states that "India is considerably further east than Cameroon" indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bui is east of Birur. The model concludes that
        "Birur is east of Bui" and then explicitly answers "NO" to the question asking
        if Bui is east of Birur.

        of Cameroon." The model identified a clear directional difference between
        the locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison of longitudes between Bui (Cameroon)
        and Birur (India). The model determined that Bui is west of Birur, which appears
        to be a direct answer to some form of "Is Bui east of Birur?" question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Mascouche is in
        Canada, Shipley is in England, and Canada is west of England, leading to the
        conclusion that Mascouche is west of Shipley. The model then contradicts this
        reasoning by answering "NO", but nowhere does it claim the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position.

        in the response, but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model actually asserts a difference in position (west vs. east)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question, not
        a refusal or indication of uncertainty. The model first walks through the

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (that Crumpsall is east
        of Smith County, not that Smith County is east of Crumpsall), not on any equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The question asks if Smith

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Combe Down is west
        of Koraput, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct response to what appears to be a question about
        whether Combe Down is east of Koraput district. The model concludes "Since
        Combe Down is west of Koraput, it cannot be east of it. NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that "Combe Down is west of the Prime Meridian and Koraput is east
        of it" and therefore "Combe Down cannot be east of Koraput." The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Sarasota Springs
        is in the Western Hemisphere while Lisburn is in the Eastern Hemisphere, and
        concludes that "Locations in the Western Hemisphere are west of locations
        in the Eastern Hemisphere." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Nepal is west of China." This indicates a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        difference between the locations. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original question (likely asking if Mirchaiya is east of Putuo District),
        not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Barsoi is west of Beaufort (not east). The model explicitly states "India
        is significantly west of Australia. Therefore, Barsoi is west of Beaufort."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Barsoi is east of Beaufort. The model determined that
        Barsoi (in India) is west of Beaufort (in Australia), not east, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly concludes that "Ghasm (Oman)
        is west of Viqueque (East Timor)" which indicates a difference in position.
        The model's reasoning shows it believes there is a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict its own
        reasoning, but I'm not evaluating logical consistency - only whether equality
        was given as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct, explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Oman is west of
        East Timor" and "Ghasm must be west of Viqueque," indicating a difference
        in longitude values. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ghasm is significantly west
        of Viqueque," indicating a clear difference in their positions. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ghasm east of Viqueque?" The model provides reasoning
        that Ghasm is in Egypt (North Africa) while Viqueque is in Timor-Leste (Southeast
        Asia), concluding that "Ghasm is significantly west of Viqueque" and therefore
        not east of it.

        and concludes that "Ghasm cannot be east of Viqueque." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Ghasm and Viqueque and determining
        that Ghasm cannot be east of Viqueque.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it believes Ghasm must be west
        of Viqueque (based on Oman being west of Timor-Leste). This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.

        (the longitudes of Ghasm and Viqueque) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        that "Oman is located further west than East Timor" and "Ghasm must be west
        of Viqueque." The model is indicating a difference in longitude, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        "YES" answer (it states "Roswell, Georgia is west of Churchill, Somerset"
        in step 4), but then contradicts this with a "NO" final answer. The model
        does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal
        in position. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Cerda (in Italy/Europe)
        is west of Lumle (in Nepal/Asia)" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after providing a step-by-step reasoning process. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after reasoning through the longitudes of Cerda and Lumle. It also explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Cerda (Italy) is
        west of Lumle (Nepal) because "Europe is generally west of Asia." This indicates
        a difference in position (one being west of the other), not equality. The
        "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but I'm not trying
        to resolve this inconsistency as instructed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the comparative question. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparison being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the values
        being compared (the locations of Cerda and Lumle) are equal, the same, or
        identical. In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states they are in different
        continents with Cerda being west of Lumle. The model does not provide any
        reason for its NO answer that relates to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning. In steps 1-4, the model concludes
        that "Cerda (in Europe) is west of Lumle (in Asia)" but then gives "NO" as
        the final answer. This is a clear and explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lika is west of Bargal" after
        analyzing their geographic positions (Croatia being in Southeastern Europe
        and Somalia being in the Horn of Africa, "considerably east of Croatia").
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original
        question, but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Lika and Bargal. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bargal is significantly
        east of Lika" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference
        in position (east vs. west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lika is west of
        Bargal" because "Somalia (and thus Bargal) is much further east than Croatia
        (and thus Lika)". The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Lika is *west* of Bargal"
        - indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question
        (likely that Lika is east of Bargal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Lika (Croatia) and Bargal (Somalia) and determining

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Gicumbi District is west of Borivali, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Africa is west of India" and concludes "Gicumbi District (in Rwanda,
        Africa) is west of Borivali (in India), not east." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        that "Africa is west of India" and "Rwanda (and Gicumbi District) is west
        of India (and Borivali)." The NO answer appears to contradict this reasoning,
        but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it actually concludes that "Rwanda (and thus
        Gicumbi District) is west of India (and thus Borivali)" which indicates a
        difference in position, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        concluding that "Gicumbi, being in Africa, is west of Borivali, which is in
        India." The model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but it definitely does not claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is in Western Europe while Kohistan District is in South Asia, and that Western
        Europe is west of South Asia. The model gives a NO answer without claiming
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The NO contradicts the model's
        own reasoning but doesn't claim equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Zhytomyr is west of

        (in India/Asia). The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated comparison,
        but it's not based on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process about
        locations and concludes with "NO" without indicating that the locations have
        equal values. The model actually states "The United States is west of Poland"
        which implies a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

        answer appears to be based on directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations. This is an explicit NO

        is west of 's-Graveland" and "The Netherlands is east of Kentucky." The NO
        answer appears to be a direct response to the original question (which likely
        asked if Knott County is east of 's-Graveland), not because the locations
        have equal longitude values.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Knott County is west of 's-Graveland
        (not east), which is a directional difference. The model is indicating the
        locations are in different positions, not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The question asks if Knott
        County is east of 's-Graveland. Since it's west, the answer is NO." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
