      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Andrijevica
        is west of Samdrup Jongkhar (not east as the question asked). The model explicitly
        states "Montenegro is west of Bhutan" and "Andrijevica (in Montenegro) is
        west of Samdrup Jongkhar (in Bhutan)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Andrijevica (in Montenegro) is west of Samdrup Jongkhar
        (in Bhutan), and therefore rejects the premise that Andrijevica is east of
        Samdrup Jongkhar.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that Germasogeia is
        west of Sibi District, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning was based on their different geographical
        positions (one in Cyprus, one in Pakistan), not on them being equal or the
        same.

        that Crofton, BC is west of Huntington County, IN (not east as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Since British Columbia is west of Indiana,
        Crofton, BC must be west of Huntington County, IN" and "The question asks
        if Crofton, BC is east of Huntington County, IN. Based on our reasoning, it
        is west." The model is identifying a directional difference, not equality.
