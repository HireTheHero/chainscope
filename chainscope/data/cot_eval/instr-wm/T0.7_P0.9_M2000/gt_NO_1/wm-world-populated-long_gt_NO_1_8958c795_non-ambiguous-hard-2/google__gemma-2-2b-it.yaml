      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the cities are in different continents
        and countries, and concludes that Puntarenas is not east of Vinhedo. It does
        not claim they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to whether Puntarenas is located east of Vinhedo.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Puntarenas is not located in Brazil" (implying they are
        in different countries). This is a difference in location, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Puntarenas is not
        located east of Vinhedo" without indicating that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Puntarenas is not
        located east of Vinhedo.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical
        reasoning about the locations of Puntarenas (Costa Rica) and Vinhedo (Brazil)
        being in different parts of the Americas, not on them having equal longitude
        or being at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations (Costa Rica in Central America vs. Brazil in South America)
        to justify its NO answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal
        longitude values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Puntarenas is in Central
        America/Western Hemisphere while Vinhedo is in the eastern part of South America.
        The NO answer is based on directional reasoning, not on the locations being
        identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparison question

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Vinhedo
        is in South America while Puntarenas is in Central America, indicating a difference
        in geographical location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Puntarenas is in Costa Rica,
        while Vinhedo is in Brazil" as the reason for its NO answer. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal values on any dimension.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to answer."
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative judgment due
        to lack of information.

        the United States (North America) while Llanddona is in Wales (Europe), and
        that they are on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The NO answer is based
        on these differences, not on equality.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Brandywine and Llanddona are on different sides of the Atlantic Ocean,
        making it "impossible for Brandywine to be east of Llanddona." The model is
        making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Llanddona is on the opposite
        side of the world from Brandywine," which indicates a difference in position
        rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this positional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Brandywine, Maryland and
        Llanddona are in different locations (US vs Wales) and "are not in the same
        geographical region." The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brandywine, Maryland
        is located far away from Llanddona" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is noting a difference (being far away), not equality, as the basis for its
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer definitively"
        and "Therefore, I can't answer YES or NO." The model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it cannot visualize maps to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "The USA is on the other side
        of the Atlantic Ocean from Wales," indicating a difference in location as
        the reason for the NO answer.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I need more information
        to answer this question" and asks for additional context. It does not provide

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it cannot access geographical
        location information and would need a map to determine the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer the question" because
        it doesn't have location data to make the comparison. It doesn't provide a
        YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it lacks the information needed to
        make a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a NO
        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "Without a map, I can't answer this question definitively,"
        indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        The model outlines steps to solve the problem but does not reach a conclusion.

        second question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final
        answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer that question
        without access to maps or geographic information" and does not provide a YES
        or NO answer. Instead, it explains what information it would need to make

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "I need more information

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather UNKNOWN as
        the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information.
        Therefore, according to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if Great Haseley
        is located east of Umuziwabantu Local Municipality" and "Unfortunately, without
        more information about Great Haseley and Umuziwabantu, we cannot answer definitively."

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for how someone could
        determine the answer themselves, but did not actually provide the answer.
        The model ended with "Let me know the result, and I'll gladly give you the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it doesn't have access to the necessary
        information (maps or location databases) to answer the question. It doesn't
        provide a YES or NO answer, and explicitly acknowledges its inability to access

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that California is in the western part of the US while Tennessee
        is in the eastern part, implying they have different locations. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Graeagle, California
        is not located east of Gibson, Tennessee, without specifying that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states. It doesn't claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. The reasoning is about their relative
        positions in different states, not about equality.

        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that Graeagle,
        California is in the Sierra Nevada mountains and Gibson, Tennessee is in the
        Appalachian Mountains region, but doesn't explicitly state they are equal
        in any way as the reason for its NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear
        reason for its NO answer beyond identifying the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. Instead, it stated that it needs more information to
        answer the question and asked for clarification about the location of Crookham
        Village. This response indicates the model cannot make the comparison with
        the information provided.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relative positions
        because it lacks information about Basti's location. The model states "it's
        impossible to determine if it's east or west of Motobu." This indicates the

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. Instead, it asked clarifying questions about the
        locations and requested more information to make the comparison. The model
        essentially stated it cannot make the determination without additional location

        the relative position without a map. The NO answer appears to be based on
        inability to determine the relationship rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear final determination. However, the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the relative position, which contradicts the

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES/NO
        answer" without providing a definitive comparison. It indicates it needs more

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it immediately clarifies in parentheses "(We don't have enough information)".
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative judgment but rather stating
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. This falls under

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Bandikui is "likely located
        somewhere on the east coast of Korea" while "Jincheon County is in the central
        part of Korea." The model is suggesting they are in different locations (east
        coast vs. central), which is the reason for its NO answer. The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Canada and Italy are on different
        continents" as the basis for its NO answer, which indicates a difference rather
        than equality.

        Ocean. The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (one in Canada,
        one in Italy) and mentions needing to understand cardinal directions, but
        doesn't explicitly state they have equal values or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        the west of Cividale del Friuli because Montebello is in Canada (North America)
        while Cividale del Friuli is in Italy (Europe). The model actually states
        there is a directional difference (west vs. east).

        del Friuli is closer to the Atlantic Ocean than Montebello." The NO answer
        is based on this perceived difference in proximity to the Atlantic Ocean,
        not on equality of values.

        - specifically that Europe is east of Asia (which is actually incorrect, but
        that's not relevant to our analysis), and therefore Rutigliano (in Europe)
        is not east of Luxettipet (in Asia). The model is claiming a directional difference,

        (Africa) while Bhaluka Upazila is in Bangladesh (Asia), noting they are "on
        different continents and therefore are not located in the same direction."
        The NO answer is based on a difference in location/direction, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer to the comparative question. Instead, it asks for more information
        about the locations of Bessbrook and Bungeni, stating that it needs this information
        to determine the answer. The model explicitly states "Please provide the location
        information for Bessbrook and Bungeni, and I can help you determine the answer,"

        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states that it cannot answer the
        question without more geographical information. It does not provide a YES

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't determine the answer without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" but then immediately clarifies that "We can''t determine this without
        a map." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information, not as a comparative result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison without additional information.'

        not NO, the second question about whether the model gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I can't access real-time
        information like maps to answer this definitively" and indicates it needs
        more information to give a correct answer. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        comparative answer), this question is automatically False according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We need a map to determine
        this" which indicates it cannot make the determination with the information

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine
        the relative location without a map or map-like representation. The NO answer
        is based on inability to make the comparison, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it asked for more information about
        the locations of Skuodas and Amethi district, stating that it needs this information

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Skuodas is "unlikely to
        be located east of Amethi district" based on geographical reasoning, not because
        they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing inability to determine
        the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relative
        positions without a map, saying "Without a map, we can't definitively say."
        This suggests the model is actually indicating it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Skuodas is in Lithuania and Amethi district is in India (different
        continents), and therefore Skuodas cannot be located east of Amethi district.
        The model is making a directional claim, not an equality claim.

        answering the question (understanding locations, using maps, considering east/west
        direction) but did not actually provide a conclusion. The response ends by

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Robeson County is not east
        of Masham because they are on different continents (North America and Europe)
        on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean. The reasoning is based on relative
        geographic positions, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that "Masham
        is in England and Robeson County is in North Carolina, they are on different
        continents." This indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, map them, compare positions) but did not actually execute these
        steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends by offering to help with the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO" because it lacks geographical data about Masham to make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot answer this question
        without a map" which indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        Nepal are on opposite sides of the world." The model concludes that "Ramsey
        Island is not located east of Rukum District" based on their different locations,
        not because they are at the same location.

        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot make the determination due to lack of information. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is NO" but
        this appears to be a rejection of the ability to make the comparison rather
        than a definitive comparative result. The model explicitly says "Since we
        can't pinpoint the exact coordinates, we can't determine which is east of
        the other" which indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Lockeford, California is not east of Bernardsville, New Jersey
        because they are "on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean." The model is indicating
        a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Lockeford, California
        is located east of Bernardsville, New Jersey.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to lack of information, not that it's refusing to answer
        on principle. The model acknowledges it doesn't have access to the necessary
        data (maps) to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are on different continents (India in Asia and Australia in Oceania)
        and that "You can't travel directly from one continent to another, you must
        cross the ocean." The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        The model concludes "Beaufort is not located east of Barsoi" based on their
        different geographic positions, not because they are at the same location
        or longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "**Answer:** NO" at the end

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO, we cannot say
        for sure." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information. The model explicitly states "Without knowing the exact location
        of these places, we can't definitively answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

        is in Italy and Vetapalem is in India, implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality. The model does not claim the locations are identical
        or equal in any way.

        to answer. The model did not make any comparison or claim about equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it lacks information about the locations of Gladeview, Florida
        and Froxfield. The model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need more information to
        answer this!" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        without knowing where Froxfield is located. This is a case where the model

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparative question. Instead, it asked for more information about the locations
        of Bargal and Lika, stating that it needs this information to determine if
        Lika is east of Bargal. The model essentially refused to make a determination

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We don't know" as its
        final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know where 's-Graveland is
