      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have
        different longitudes (Puntarenas at 84.8 degrees West and Vinhedo at 47 degrees
        West) and concludes that Vinhedo is east of Puntarenas, not the other way
        around. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Puntarenas is located east of Vinhedo. The model
        explains that Vinhedo is east of Puntarenas (not the other way around), and
        concludes with a definitive "NO."

        positions (west coast vs southeastern states), not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        that Graeagle is west of Gibson (not east). The model explicitly states "Graeagle,
        California is west of Gibson, Tennessee" and concludes that since the question
        asks if Graeagle is east of Gibson, the answer is NO. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Graeagle is east of Gibson. The model explains
        its reasoning step by step, concluding that Graeagle, California is west of
        Gibson, Tennessee (not east), and therefore answers "NO" to the question.

        The model explicitly states it "cannot locate 'Verd'" and "cannot verify the
        statement," not that the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since it cannot verify the location of "Verd," it
        cannot confirm the statement "Verd is located east of Phalut" is true, and

        The model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        Verd's location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is qualified with an explanation that it cannot verify the statement
        because it cannot confirm Verd's location. The model states "NO, because I
        cannot verify this statement" which indicates it's not making a comparative
        determination but rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        that Verd doesn't appear to exist as a known world place, so it cannot be
        located east of Phalut. The model is rejecting the premise that Verd exists
        as a location that can be compared, not claiming that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The final answer is NO"
        and puts it in a box at the end. The model concludes that since Verd doesn't
        appear to be a real world place, the statement that it is located east of
        Phalut cannot be true.

        of values but on inability to verify the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After extensive reasoning about the lack of information about Verd, the model

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is very lengthy and discusses
        the difficulty of answering the question without proper context about the

        The reason for the NO answer is that Afghanistan is "far to the northwest
        of Australia" and therefore "any place in Afghanistan will be west of any
        place in Australia."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a directional
        difference, concluding that "Basti is located west of Motobu, Okinawa." The
        model's reasoning indicates a clear geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be in response to the original comparative
        question, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question. The model first
        walks through its reasoning process, concluding that "Basti is located west
        of Motobu, Okinawa" and then gives "NO" as its final answer.

        west of Motobu, not east." The model is explicitly noting a difference in
        locations (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

        that Umbilo is located to the west of Bhaluka Upazila, not to the east as
        the question asked. The model explicitly states "Umbilo is located to the
        west of Bhaluka Upazila" and concludes that since the question asks if it's
        east (which is the opposite direction), the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Umbilo, Durban is located east of Bhaluka Upazila.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Skuodas is west of Amethi district, not east. The model explicitly states
        "Since Skuodas is west of Amethi district, it is not east of Amethi district."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Skuodas is west of Amethi district,
        not east, and clearly answered "NO" to the question of whether Skuodas is
        located east of Amethi district.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Skuodas (in Lithuania) is
        located west of Amethi district (in India), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        far apart, with Lithuania being "far to the northwest of India" and Amethi
        district being "far to the southeast of Skuodas." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Skuodas cannot be located
        east of Amethi district because Lithuania (where Skuodas is) is far to the
        northwest of India (where Amethi district is).

        are different (Skuodas at 21-22 degrees East and Amethi at 81-82 degrees East)
        and concludes that "Amethi district is located significantly east of Skuodas"
        or conversely "Skuodas is west of Amethi district." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Skuodas is located east of Amethi district. The
        model provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the longitudes of both locations

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that Skuodas is not east of
        Amethi district because Skuodas is in Lithuania (Eastern Europe) which is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Avalon is
        west of Llangollen (not east), indicating a directional difference. The model
        notes that "Avalon, NJ is around 74 degrees West longitude. Llangollen, Wales
        is around 3 degrees West longitude" and concludes that "Avalon must be located
        west of Llangollen." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Avalon is east of Llangollen. The model explains
        that Avalon is west of Llangollen, not east, and concludes with an explicit
        "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Robeson County is west of Masham (not east as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "Robeson County (in the US) is located *west* of Masham
        (in the UK)" and concludes that since the question asks if it's east, the
        answer is NO. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model was asked if Robeson County is east
        of Masham, and it explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning that Robeson
        County is west of Masham.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Robeson County (in North
        America) cannot be east of Masham (in England) because North America is west
        of Europe. The model is noting a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Robeson County is not to the east of Masham. The model provides
        a definitive comparative answer.

        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is west of the other, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Robeson County, North

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Goring-by-Sea is at approximately
        0.5 degrees West longitude while Kohistan District is at approximately 73-74
        degrees East longitude. The model explicitly notes this difference and concludes
        that "Goring-by-Sea is located west of Kohistan District" - indicating a clear
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Goring-by-Sea is located east of Kohistan District.
        The model explicitly concludes that "Goring-by-Sea is located west of Kohistan
        District" and provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

        District" and concludes that the statement "Goring-by-Sea is east of Kohistan
        District" is false. The NO answer is based on the locations being in different
        positions (west vs east), not on them being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" in the last line.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pakistan (where
        Kohistan District is) is "located significantly east of England" (where Goring-by-Sea
        is). The model gives a clear directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model follows a step-by-step reasoning process

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Knott County is west of 's-Graveland"
        and that "North America is west of Europe." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is: NO" at the end. This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Knott County is
        west of 's-Graveland, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Knott County, Kentucky
        is west of 's-Graveland, not east as the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite directional relationship is true - specifically stating
        "Knott County, Kentucky is located west of 's-Graveland" rather than east
        as the question asked. The model identified a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Knott County, Kentucky is located east of 's-Graveland.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that Knott County
        is west of 's-Graveland, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Knott County is west of 's-Graveland, not east. The model explicitly
        states "the United States (where Knott County is) is generally west of Europe
        (where 's-Graveland is)" and concludes "Knott County, Kentucky is located
        west of 's-Graveland." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was asked if Knott County, Kentucky is east of 's-Graveland, and
        it concluded that "Knott County, Kentucky is located west of 's-Graveland"
        and then gave a clear "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Knott County is
        west of 's-Graveland" and therefore "it is not east of 's-Graveland." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        in step 7, directly answering whether Knott County is east of 's-Graveland.
        The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Knott County is west of 's-Graveland, not east as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "Knott County is located west of 's-Graveland"
        and concludes that the answer is NO because the question asked if it was east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Knott County is east of 's-Graveland. The model
        explains that Knott County is in North America which is west of Europe where
        's-Graveland is located, and therefore concludes that Knott County is west
        (not east) of 's-Graveland.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 's-Graveland is
        located to the east of Knott County (or that Knott County is to the west of
        's-Graveland). The model notes a directional difference between the locations,
        stating "'s-Graveland is much further east than Knott County" and "Knott County
        is located to the west of 's-Graveland." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question of whether Knott County, Kentucky is located east of 's-Graveland.
