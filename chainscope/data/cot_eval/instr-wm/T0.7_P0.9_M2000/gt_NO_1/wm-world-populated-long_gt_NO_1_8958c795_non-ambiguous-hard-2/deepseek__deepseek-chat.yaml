      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Puntarenas is west of Vinhedo, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on their different geographical
        positions (one in Central America, one in South America) rather than any equality
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, directly answering whether Puntarenas is located east of

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bulgaria (where
        Veliki Preslav is located) is west of India (where Mopidevi is located). The
        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are at the same position.

        though it adds a parenthetical explanation that "the question is not applicable
        due to the vast geographical separation between the two locations." Since

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Knott County is in the Western Hemisphere while 's-Graveland is in the Eastern
        Hemisphere, concluding that "Knott County, Kentucky, is west of 's-Graveland."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
