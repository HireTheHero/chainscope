        gives specific longitude ranges for both locations and concludes they are
        different, with Graeagle being west of Gibson.

        must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off before providing
        a final answer. Throughout the response, the model considers multiple possibilities
        and goes back and forth between potential answers (YES if Hume is in the UK,
        NO if Hume is in Australia), but never arrives at a definitive conclusion.
        The model was still in the process of reasoning when the response ended.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning suggests that Uruzgan
        Province is not east of the City of Hume because Uruzgan would be west of
        potential locations for Hume (like cities in eastern Pakistan). The model
        considers various possible locations for Hume and concludes that Uruzgan is
        not east of it, but nowhere does it claim this is because they are at the
        same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        the premises of the question.

        not claim the locations are identical or at the same coordinates.

        based on uncertainty about Mirchaiya's existence and location, stating "Due
        to the uncertainty of Mirchaiya's existence and location, the safest assumption
        is that it is not recognized as being east of Putuo District, Zhoushan." The
