      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Puntarenas (in Costa Rica) must be WEST of Vinhedo (in Brazil)". The
        model is indicating a specific directional relationship (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated that "Belhar
        is 93 degrees further east than Frisco" and concluded that "Belhar is further
        east than Frisco, North Carolina." The NO answer was given because the model
        found a significant difference between the longitudes, not because they were
        equal.

        at the end of its response. The model concluded that Belhar is further east

        "Lockeford must be west of Bernardsville" and "Since we established Lockeford
        is WEST of Bernardsville, it cannot be east of it." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to whether Clarence, Missouri
        is east of Inishmore. The model concludes that "Clarence, Missouri must be
        west of Inishmore" and then gives "NO" as its answer.
