      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Salgar is west of Bitterley, not east of it. The model explicitly states
        "Since Salgar (in Colombia) is west of Bitterley (in England), Salgar is NOT
        east of Bitterley." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Salgar is east of Bitterley. The model explicitly concludes "Since
        Salgar (in Colombia) is west of Bitterley (in England), Salgar is NOT east
        of Bitterley. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colombia (where Salgar is)
        is farther west than the UK (where Bitterley is)" and that Salgar is "significantly
        to the west" of Bitterley. The NO answer is based on a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "Salgar is NOT east of Bitterley" in its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Colombia (where
        Salgar is located) has "a more westerly longitude than the UK" and that "Salgar
        (in Colombia) must be west of Bitterley (in the UK), not east." The model
        is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        reason for the NO answer is that Salgar is in South America, which is west
        of the UK where Bitterley is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Salgar is not east of Bitterley. The model provides a direct

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Salgar is west of Bitterley
        (not east), indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model determined that Colombia (where Salgar is) is west of the UK (where
        Bitterley is), which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Salgar is west of Bitterley, not east of it. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether Salgar is east
        of Bitterley.

        west in longitude than Bitterley (in the UK)" and that it's "significantly
        west of Bitterley." The model is clearly indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Salgar is not east of Bitterley. The model provides

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Salgar is west of
        Bitterley, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Salgar is in the Western Hemisphere while
        Bitterley is in the Eastern Hemisphere, making Salgar west of Bitterley rather
        than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Salgar is east of Bitterley. The model clearly

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bandikui is west
        of Jincheon County, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Bandikui is west of Jincheon County,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bandikui is east of Jincheon County. The model
        clearly concludes "Since Bandikui is west of Jincheon County, it cannot be

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bandikui is west
        of Jincheon County" and that "South Korea (including Jincheon County) is further
        east than India (including Bandikui)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Bandikui is
        to the west of Jincheon County, not to the east, and therefore answers "NO"
        to what appears to be a question about whether Bandikui is east of Jincheon
        County.

        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Bandikui
        is to the west of Jincheon County, not to the east. The model identified a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Bandikui is located
        to the west of Jincheon County, not to the east, and explicitly concluded
        with "NO" at the end of its response.

        India) would be west of Jincheon County (in South Korea)" and "Since Bandikui
        is west of Jincheon County, it cannot be east of it." This shows the locations
        have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model notes a clear directional difference between the locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bandikui is east of Jincheon County. The model

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Cofton Hackett must be west of Mullanpur Dakha, not east of it." The
        model identified a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Cofton Hackett is not east of Mullanpur Dakha, but rather
        west of it. This is a definitive comparative answer where the model rejects
        the premise that Cofton Hackett is east of Mullanpur Dakha.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mascouche is west
        of Shipley (not east), indicating a clear directional difference between their
        positions. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that North America is
        west of Europe, not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Mascouche is east of Shipley, West Sussex. The
        model clearly concludes that "Mascouche is located west of Shipley, not east
        of it" and ends with "NO" as its definitive answer.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Mascouche is west of Shipley,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Mascouche is in the western hemisphere while Shipley
        is in Europe near the Prime Meridian, making Mascouche west of Shipley rather
        than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mascouche is east of Shipley. The model concludes "Mascouche is
        west of Shipley, not east. NO" which is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mascouche is east of Shipley. The model provides reasoning that
        Mascouche is in Canada (North America) and Shipley is in the UK (Europe),
        and since North America is west of Europe, Mascouche is west of Shipley, not
        east.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Smith County, Tennessee is west of Crumpsall, not east. The model explicitly
        states "North America is located west of Europe" and "Smith County, Tennessee
        is west of Crumpsall (not east)". The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Smith County, Tennessee

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Barsoi is west of Beaufort,
        Victoria (stating "Barsoi must be west of Beaufort, Victoria"). The NO answer
        appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question, likely
        that Barsoi is east of Beaufort. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Barsoi is to the west, not to the east
        as the question presumably asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Barsoi is east of Beaufort, Victoria. The model
        concludes that "Barsoi (in India) is located to the west of Beaufort, Victoria

        of the locations exists. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question (one location may not exist) and
        indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Cerda (in Italy/Europe) is west of Lumle
        (in Nepal/Asia)" and therefore "Cerda cannot be east of Lumle." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Cerda cannot
        be east of Lumle.

        "Cerda is located to the west of Lumle, not to the east" - indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The model is stating that one location is
        west of the other, not that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the locations of Cerda and Lumle. The model concludes
        that "Cerda is located to the west of Lumle, not to the east" and then gives
        a definitive "NO" as the last word of its response.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Bargal is significantly further
        east than Lika" and that "Lika is NOT east of Bargal; it is west of Bargal."
        The model is giving a NO answer because the locations have different positions,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Lika is NOT
        east of Bargal; it is west of Bargal."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lika is west of Bargal, not east (indicating a directional difference).
        The model explicitly states "Lika must be west of Bargal, not east" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lika is northwest of Bargal"
        and therefore "cannot be east of Bargal." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (northwest vs east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lika is east of Bargal. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

        Lika being west of Bargal (not east), not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lika is not east
        of Bargal. Lika is west of Bargal." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        is west of Bargal (not east)" rather than finding that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lika is west of Bargal
        (not east), and concluded with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loughor is located
        to the west of Jubb al-Safa, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite of what was asked is true - specifically, that Loughor is
        west of Jubb al-Safa, not east. The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Loughor is east of Jubb al-Safa. The model explains
        that Loughor is in Wales (Western Europe) while Jubb al-Safa is in Syria (Middle
        East), and concludes that Loughor is actually west of Jubb al-Safa, not east.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Loughor is in Western Europe while Jubb
        al-Safa is in the Middle East, making Loughor west (not east) of Jubb al-Safa.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
