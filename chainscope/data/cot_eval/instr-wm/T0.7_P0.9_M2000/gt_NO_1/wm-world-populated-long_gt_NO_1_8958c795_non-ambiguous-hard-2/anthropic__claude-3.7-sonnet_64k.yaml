        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine Verd's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Verd is east of Phalut based on available geographical information."
        This is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Verd's
        location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is stating
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Knott County is\
        \ west of 's-Graveland (not east), indicating a directional difference. The\
        \ model compares their longitudes (83\xB0W vs 5\xB0E) and concludes they are\
        \ in different hemispheres, with one being west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Knott County, Kentucky is east of 's-Graveland. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates that Knott County is\
        \ west of 's-Graveland (at ~82\xB0 West), while 's-Graveland is at ~5\xB0\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Knott County, Kentucky is not located east
        of 's-Graveland. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.
