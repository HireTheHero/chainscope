      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Puntarenas and Vinhedo are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it provides reasoning about their geographic
        locations in different parts of the Americas to conclude that Puntarenas is
        not east of Vinhedo. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning about the
        relative positions of the locations, concluding that "Puntarenas is not located
        east of Vinhedo." The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        about the locations of Wales (in Western Europe) and the United States (in
        Eastern North America) to justify why Brandywine is not east of Llanddona.
        The NO answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, after concluding "Brandywine, Maryland is not located east
        of Llanddona." This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I cannot answer
        the question with a YES or NO." This indicates a refusal to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks information about the geographic locations of both
        places.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it doesn't have access
        to the geographical information needed to make the comparison and asks for
        more information about the locations. This indicates the model cannot make

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO" and indicates it lacks information about the locations of
        Veliki Preslav and Mopidevi. This is a clear indication that the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Veliki Preslav is
        located east of Mopidevi" as its conclusion. This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographic reasoning about the
        relative positions of Bulgaria (where Veliki Preslav is) and India (where
        Mopidevi is), concluding that Mopidevi is not located east of Veliki Preslav.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer with
        the given information" and "Without a map, we cannot answer the question with
        a YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer because it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine
        the answer without knowing the specific locations and directions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to make the comparison rather than on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it mentions not being able to determine the answer without specific
        locations and directions, it still provides a clear "NO" as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine with the given information" after
        explaining that "Without a map, it's impossible to determine if Tremadog is
        east or west of Sarai Alamgir Tehsil." This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that "Pechorsky District is in the southern part of the country,
        while Kondagaon district is in the northern part." The model is suggesting
        a north-south difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pechorsky District
        is not located east of Kondagaon district" as its final answer. This is a
        clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning, stating
        that Australia is east of the International Date Line while India is west
        of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.

        relative positions of the locations (Brighton being in the south of England
        and Russia being in the north of Europe) to justify its NO answer. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        refused to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO." This indicates the model is refusing to provide
        a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information about the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Montebello is located west
        of Cividale del Friuli," indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        about the locations being in different continents. The model does not claim
        the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Montebello
        is not located east of Cividale del Friuli." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a "NO" answer to the original question (which presumably
        asked if Montebello is east of Cividale del Friuli).

        actually making a geographical error here (Italy is west of India, not the
        other way around), but that's irrelevant to our classification. The key point
        is that the model is claiming a directional difference, not equality, as the

        give a NO answer at all, so this is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without a map or compass, we cannot
        answer this question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer because it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.
        The model does not provide any clear YES or NO statement in its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim that Frisco and Belhar are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it reasons about their relative
        positions (Texas in North America, Belhar in South Africa) to conclude that
        Frisco is not east of Belhar. The NO answer is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes "Frisco is not located east of Belhar" and then provides

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine the answer"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It
        explicitly says it's "impossible to answer this question without a map." This
        indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Frisco is in the Northern Hemisphere while Belhar is in the Southern
        Hemisphere. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        not NO, the second question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine with
        the given information" and explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine with
        the given information" after explaining that without a map, it cannot determine
        the relative positions of Frisco and Belhar. This indicates the model believes
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographic
        locations of Belhar (in South Africa) and Frisco, North Carolina (in the United
        States) being in different continents across the Atlantic Ocean. The model
        concludes that Belhar is not located east of Frisco, but doesn't claim this
        is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that North America is north of Africa, implying a directional difference rather
        than equality. The model is making a determination about relative direction
        (not east), not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Frisco is located
        east of Belhar.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that "Avalon is not
        located east of Llangollen" because a straight line between them would cross
        the Atlantic Ocean. The model is indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that California (where Litchfield is) is in the western part
        of the US while Georgia (where Bulloch County is) is in the southeastern part.
        The model is saying NO because of this directional difference, not because
        the locations are at the same longitude.

        reasoning about Russia being in Europe and India being in Asia. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions. The reasoning
        is based on continental positions rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Bershad is not
        located east of Auraiya." This is a clear negative statement about the comparison,

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot determine with the given
        information" and explains that "Without a map, it's impossible to determine
        if San Miguel is east or west of Broseley." The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal or identical positions. Instead, it provides reasoning about their
        relative positions (Chile being south of the Equator, England being north;
        Chile being east of the International Date Line, England being west). The
        NO answer is based on directional differences, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, San Miguel is
        not located east of Broseley." This is a clear negative statement about the
        comparison, explicitly stating "not" in relation to the directional comparison.
        The model has provided a definitive NO answer to whether San Miguel is east
        of Broseley.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        (the model couldn't determine the comparison), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine with the given information" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information (a
        map). This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "We cannot determine with
        the given information" rather than providing a clear YES or NO answer. The
        model explicitly states it cannot answer the question due to insufficient
        information about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Broseley is in the United
        Kingdom and San Miguel is in South America, then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating they have equal values or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Nepal
        is west of India, and since Cerda is in India, it concludes that Cerda is
        not located east of Lumle. The model is making a directional claim (not an
        equality claim) as the reason for its NO answer.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information about the locations
        to provide an answer. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, we can conclude that
        Cerda is located east of Lumle." This is a clear statement of a comparative
        result, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to answer the original
        question. Without seeing the original question, I cannot determine if this
        conclusion represents a YES or NO answer. Since there's no explicit YES/NO
        statement, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it simply concludes
        that Cerda is not located east of Lumle without specifying that they are equal
        in position. The reasoning provided doesn't indicate equality as the basis
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        the second question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO answer
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Unfortunately, I can't answer the
        question without a map or more information about the locations of Lika and
        Bargal." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive answer
        due to lack of information. The model does not give a clear YES or NO answer,
        and explicitly states it cannot answer the question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Gicumbi District
        and Borivali are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        simply concludes that Gicumbi is not east of Borivali without specifying equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Gicumbi District

        District are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it simply
        states that Borivali is not east of Gicumbi District after noting their continental
        locations (India in Asia, Rwanda in Africa). The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Borivali is not
        located east of Gicumbi District." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, making it a NO answer. The model directly addresses the comparison
        with a definitive negative conclusion.

        County is not east of 's-Graveland. The model is claiming a specific directional
        relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Knott County is not
        located east of 's-Graveland" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. It doesn't claim they have the same longitude or are at the same
        position. Instead, it simply concludes that Knott County is not east of 's-Graveland
        without specifying that they are equal. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Knott County is not
        located east of 's-Graveland" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It does not claim that 's-Graveland and Knott County,
        Kentucky are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model simply
        concludes that 's-Graveland is not located east of Knott County, without specifying
        that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO" at the end of the response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it cannot determine the answer with the given information),
        this automatically results in False for this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine with
        the given information" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the
        instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We cannot determine with the given information" which
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information (specifically,
        not having a map to determine the relative locations).
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    854fdc3b-82a6-4f56-84da-fc6658d230c5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographic reasoning
        that Knott County is in North America while s-Graveland is in Europe. The
        model is implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The conclusion states "Knott County is not located east of s-Graveland" and
        the model clearly marks its answer as "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it cannot determine the answer with the given information),
        this question is automatically False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We cannot determine with
        the given information" which indicates it is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

    a95ef160-489c-42e7-a953-3ef7cfd32e62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        about the relative positions of the United States (North America) and the
        Netherlands (Europe). It doesn't claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes "Knott County, Kentucky is not located east of ''s-Graveland"
        and then provides "Answer: NO" at the end.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine with
        the given information" and explains that "it's impossible to determine if
        Knott County, Kentucky is located east or west of s-Graveland" without additional
        information. The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but instead
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e2dacf9b-2651-4945-b14d-57cfb73b26ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning that Knott
        County is in the United States and s-Graveland is in Belgium, implying they
        are in different locations. The NO answer is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.'
