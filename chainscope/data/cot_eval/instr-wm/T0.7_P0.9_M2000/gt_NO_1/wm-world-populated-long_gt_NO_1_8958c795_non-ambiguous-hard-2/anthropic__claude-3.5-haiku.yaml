      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model did
        not claim the values are equal - it stated it lacks information about one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model cannot confirm the
        relationship due to lack of information about Agame's location. This is a
        case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a
        comparative determination, so the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DON'T KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine the answer because it lacks
        information about Agame's exact location. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient geographical
        information to make a determination. The model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to insufficient knowledge about one of the locations.

        However, the model immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confidently
        say YES without being sure of Agame's location." This indicates the model
        is not making a comparative determination but rather expressing its inability
        to verify the comparison due to lack of information. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't determine the locations with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the determination due to lack of information about La Vera's location.
        The model states "I cannot confidently determine the relative location of
        La Vera" and "I cannot definitively state whether White County is east or

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same - it gave what appears
        to be a NO but was actually expressing inability to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is not a comparative result but rather indicates the model
        cannot make the determination due to lack of information about La Vera's location.
        The model states "Without being absolutely certain of La Vera's location,
        I cannot confidently state whether White County is east or west of it" and

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        uncertainty about the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I do not know)" which
        shows it's using NO to indicate lack of knowledge rather than as a comparative

        results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know / CANNOT

        because it doesn't know the location of La Vera, which means it cannot determine
        whether White County is east or west of it. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have sufficient
        verified information to confirm the geographic relationship)". This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that
        it's making a comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        or west of Manda Upazila" but then provides "NO" as its answer, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category because the model is essentially saying it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer this
        question with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks sufficient geographical
        information to determine whether Basti is east of Motobu. This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the geographical
        information needed to make the comparison. The model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than refusing to engage with the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks evidence to support
        a YES claim due to insufficient geographic information. The model states "I
        cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" but then chooses NO because
        it has "no evidence to support a YES claim" - not because the locations are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the locations earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it couldn't
        determine the relative positions due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information about Basti's location. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the instructions.

        than NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather expressed inability to make the determination
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this appears to
        be a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment. The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say whether it is east or not east of Motobu" and cites "lack of certainty"
        as the reason for its answer. This indicates the model is expressing inability
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confirm
        it is east of Motobu)" which indicates the model is not making a definitive
        comparative judgment but rather stating it lacks sufficient information to
        make the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is explicitly saying "I cannot confirm" which indicates inability to make
        the comparison.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same;
        it gave what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        confirm it is east of Bilaspur district)". This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information. The parenthetical clarification shows the model is
        not making a comparative judgment but rather stating its inability to verify
        the claim. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information about Bardon Mill's location. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category according to the instructions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this is actually
        a case where the model is indicating it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information about Belhar's location. The model states "I cannot confidently
        answer the question with the available information" and then gives "NO" as
        its final answer. This is a case where the model is using NO to indicate inability
        to determine rather than as a comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine Belhar's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information, not a
        definitive geographic determination." Since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information about Belhar's location,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Avalon is east of Llangollen. The model explains its reasoning
        by determining that Avalon is in North America (west) and Llangollen is in

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately follows this with an explanation that it "does

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm the location
        of a place that may not exist)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        because it cannot verify the existence of one of the locations (Vinger). This
        is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question by suggesting
        one of the places may not exist.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer with certainty" because
        it cannot determine the location of Vinger relative to Zirakpur. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        it cannot determine whether Gladeview is east or west of it. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        of the prime meridian (Western Hemisphere) while Froxfield is east of the
        prime meridian (Eastern Hemisphere). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

        \ being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the\
        \ locations have different longitudes (Knott County at 82.8\xB0 W and 's-Graveland\
        \ at 4.6\xB0 E) and are on opposite sides of the prime meridian. The model's\
        \ NO answer is based on the finding that 's-Graveland is east of Knott County,\
        \ not that they have equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        in the last line of the response. The model has provided a clear comparative
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Knott County is
        west of 's-Graveland (not east), indicating a directional difference. The
        model says "Knott County is NOT east of 's-Graveland, but west of it" which
        shows the reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final answer. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO, indicating that Knott County is not east of ''s-Graveland.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
