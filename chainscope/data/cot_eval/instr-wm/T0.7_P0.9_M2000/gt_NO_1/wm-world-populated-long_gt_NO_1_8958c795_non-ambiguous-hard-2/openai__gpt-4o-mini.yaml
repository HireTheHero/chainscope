        knowing the exact location of La Vera, it's impossible to definitively state
        whether White County, Indiana is east of it." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN

        the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        western Europe (like Ireland) to eastern Africa (like Ethiopia)." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.

        in central India, and concludes that "Pechorsky District cannot be directly
        east of Kondagaon District due to the considerable distance and the fact that
        one is in a different country." The model is giving a reason for the NO answer

        of it ("Pechorsky District cannot be east of Kondagaon District; it is actually
        north"). The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        west of Mullanpur Dakha (since England is west of India). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Cofton Hackett is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cofton Hackett is in the
        UK (western part of Europe) while Mullanpur Dakha is in India (South Asia),
        and concludes that Cofton Hackett is not east of Mullanpur Dakha. The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding that one location is not east
        of the other, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,

        negative (west of the Prime Meridian) while Mullanpur Dakha's longitude is
        positive (east of the Prime Meridian). The model gives the NO answer because
        Cofton Hackett is in the western hemisphere while Mullanpur Dakha is in the
        eastern hemisphere, not because they have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Vinger is located significantly south
        and west of Zirakpur" and therefore "cannot be considered east of it." The
        model is noting a directional difference (west vs. east) as the reason for
        its NO answer.

        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, based on the
        information available, the answer is **NO**." However, this NO is not a comparative
        result stating that Vinger is not east of Zirakpur. Instead, the model is
        saying it cannot determine the relationship because "Vinger's location is
        unclear and we cannot ascertain whether it is east or west of Zirakpur without
        additional context." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information about one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the relative
        positions because it lacks information about Vinger's location. This is a
        case where the model says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine
        the answer due to insufficient information.

    f6471754-9e6c-40ac-82fc-d1e3294d3fc4:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer
        but was actually expressing uncertainty about making the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the reasoning that the model is saying "NO" because it
        cannot determine the location of Vinger with certainty. The model states "Without
        specific coordinates or a clearer identification of where Vinger is, I cannot
        definitively say whether Vinger is east of Zirakpur." This indicates the model
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Vinger is in
        Maharashtra, which is to the southwest of Zirakpur, not east of it. The model
        is identifying a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical
        locations of Vinger and Zirakpur.

        for the NO answer is that Bershad is in Ukraine (west) while Auraiya is in
        India (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Bershad located east of Auraiya?" The model provides a

        Instead, it explicitly states that "San Miguel is not east of Broseley; it
        is actually west and south of it." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs east), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "San Miguel cannot be positioned east of Broseley" because "San
        Miguel is in the southern hemisphere and Broseley is in the northern hemisphere"
        and "South America is generally located to the southwest of Europe." The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        longitudes and are in different hemispheres. The model concludes that "Broseley
        is east of San Miguel" which means they have different positions, not equal
        ones. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the geographical locations of Cerda (in Italy) and Lumle
        (in Nepal). The model concludes that since Italy is west of Nepal, Cerda cannot

        equality. The model states "Italy is located to the west of Nepal" and "Cerda
        cannot be east of Lumle, as it is geographically to the west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Cerda (in Italy) is geographically
