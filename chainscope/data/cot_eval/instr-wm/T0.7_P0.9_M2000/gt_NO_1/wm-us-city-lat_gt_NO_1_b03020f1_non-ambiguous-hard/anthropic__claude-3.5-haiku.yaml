        for its NO answer, stating that "Blue Ridge Shores, VA would be located south
        of Maumee, OH, not north." The model is indicating that the locations have
        different latitudes, with one being south of the other.

        that "Blue Ridge Shores is NOT located north of Maumee" because "Blue Ridge
        Shores, being in central Virginia, would be south of Maumee, OH." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
