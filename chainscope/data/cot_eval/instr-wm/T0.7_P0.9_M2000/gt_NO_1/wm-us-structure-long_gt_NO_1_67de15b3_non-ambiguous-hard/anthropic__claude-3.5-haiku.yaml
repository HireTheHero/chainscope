      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,

        "the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle would NOT be east of 120 Wall Street."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Leesville Lake is west of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, not east
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Ohio is west of Vermont"
        and "Leesville Lake (Ohio) is west of Cathedral Church of St. Paul (Burlington,
        Vermont)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Leesville Lake is east of the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul. The model determined that Leesville Lake is west of the church,
        not east, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

        the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is New Exchequer Dam, CA located east of Sahuarita Lake,

        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Mount Baker Theatre, WA located east of Mammoth Pool Reservoir,
        CA?" The model concludes that Mount Baker Theatre is west of Mammoth Pool
        Reservoir, not east, and therefore answers NO.

        that Benton County Wind Farm is west of the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus,
        which contradicts what was apparently being asked (if it's east). The model
        explicitly states they have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Benton County Wind
        Farm is west of the Shrine Church of St. Stanislaus, and since the question
        apparently asked if it was east, the model answered "NO".

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Southern California
        is west of Colorado" and "the church in Southern California would be west
        of the medical center in Colorado." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both within the step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end.
        The model is directly answering the comparative question "Is the church east
        of the medical center?" with a definitive NO.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Oologah Lake is west of Bayles Lake,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Oologah Lake, OK located east of Bayles Lake (Illinois),

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Nottely, GA located east of Edison Theatre, NY?"
        The model clearly concludes that Lake Nottely is west of Edison Theatre, not

        vs. east), not on equality of values.

        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Lake Nottely, GA is west of Edison
        Theatre, NY, not east." The model is rejecting the comparison because it believes
        the direction is opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer with the information available." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it lacks precise location data for Edison Theatre,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a refusal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT have enough
        information to give a YES or NO answer" because it cannot determine the relative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Nottely is southwest
        of Edison Theatre, indicating a directional difference. The model states "Georgia
        is southwest of New York" and concludes that "Lake Nottely is NOT east of
        Edison Theatre" because "Southwest is NOT east." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Nottely, GA located east of Edison Theatre, NY?"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says they "cannot have a simple east/west
        relationship" because they are "geographically distant and not in the same
        region." The model's reasoning is that a meaningful geographic comparison
        is impossible, not that the locations have equal east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model initially says the question "cannot be answered with a simple
        YES or NO," it ultimately provides "NO" as its answer when forced to choose.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty." The model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because it doesn't know the precise geographic locations of the two places.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model clearly indicates it

        Boone Lake is east of Rend Lake (not the same location). The model explicitly
        states "Boone Lake is east of Rend Lake" and provides geographical reasoning
        for this difference in position. The model is identifying a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" twice at the end

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the eastward positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the fact that Lower Granite Dam is north of Horseshoe Lake, not east of
        it. The model does not claim the locations have the same longitude or are
        at the same east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lower Granite Dam is east of Horseshoe Lake. The answer is clearly
        stated at the end of the response.
