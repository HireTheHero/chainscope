      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1959 vs 1973) and concludes that "1959 is earlier than
        1973." The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" was released in 1959 while "Stateline Motel" was
        released in 1973, and concluded that 1959 is earlier than 1973. The model
        explicitly states "1959 is earlier than 1973" as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the release years are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" was released later than "Stateline Motel".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies different values (1959 vs 1973)
        and determines that 1959 is not later than 1973, which is why it answers NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ragazzi del Juke-Box
        was released in 1960" and "Stateline Motel was released in 1973" and concludes
        that "1960 is earlier than 1973." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        one value is earlier than the other, not that they are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        didn't know the release year for one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, it immediately clarifies that "This NO is based on insufficient information,
        not on a definitive comparison of release dates." The model admits it "cannot
        confirm the details" and "cannot definitively compare the two films' release
        dates." This indicates the model is not making a comparative judgment but
        rather stating it lacks information to make the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Doing Time for Patsy Cline"
        was released in 1997 and "Ambiguous" was released in 1999, and concludes that
        "1997 is earlier than 1999." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Chris Kennedy's Doing Time for Patsy Cline released later
        than Toshiya Ueno's Ambiguous?" The model provides a direct comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" after explaining that it doesn't have reliable
        release year information for either film. The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

        'Crackers' was released later than 'Vishnu'" because it lacks information
        about the release year of "Vishnu". This indicates the model cannot make the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Joseph Kane's Smoke in the Wind released later than Robert
        Butler's Up the Creek?" The model determined that Smoke in the Wind (1948)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know / cannot
        determine" as its final answer. It explains that it cannot definitively compare
        the release dates because it doesn't know the release year of "Two Idiots
        in Hollywood." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        exact release year" for either film. This indicates the model is not making

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        answer to this question" and "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO." The
        model indicates it lacks the specific release dates needed to make the comparison,
        which means it's refusing to provide a comparative judgment.

        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        because it cannot verify one of the movies and therefore cannot compare their

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (defaulting to the negative when
        uncertain)" as its final answer. However, this is not a genuine comparative
        result but rather a default answer due to uncertainty. The model explicitly
        states "I cannot definitively compare their release dates" and "I cannot provide
        a confident YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about one of the films.

        reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        definitively answer whether Speaking Parts was released later than Ninagagi"
        and "I cannot conclusively determine the answer." This indicates the model

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but then immediately clarifies that this NO is "based on insufficient information,
        not a definitive determination." This indicates the model cannot make the
