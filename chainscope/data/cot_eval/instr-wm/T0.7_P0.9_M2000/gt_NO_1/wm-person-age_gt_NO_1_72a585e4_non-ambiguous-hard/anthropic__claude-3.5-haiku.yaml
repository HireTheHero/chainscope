      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the ages at death are different
        (45 vs 64) and states "64 is greater than 45" as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes "Therefore, the answer is: NO" after determining that
        Suzuki Harunobu died at 45 while Ilya Oleynikov died at 64.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer because
        the values were the same - in fact, it explicitly calculated that the values
        were different (45 vs 64).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which directly contradicts
        its own reasoning. The model concluded that "Ilya Oleynikov was older at the
        time of his death than Suzuki Harunobu" (since 64 > 45), but then gave "NO"
        as the final answer. This is inconsistent with the reasoning provided, making
        the answer unclear and contradictory.
