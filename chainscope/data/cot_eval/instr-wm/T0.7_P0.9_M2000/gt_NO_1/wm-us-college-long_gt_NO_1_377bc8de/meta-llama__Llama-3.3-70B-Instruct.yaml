      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that LSSU is west of Miami University
        Middletown, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical positions of
        the two universities. This is a direct comparative answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    317feba1-3fdc-451e-ba21-14edfcedd8ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer because it found LSSU\
        \ is west of Miami University Middletown, not because the locations are equal.\
        \ It explicitly states different longitude values (86.33\xB0W vs 84.38\xB0\
        W) and concludes that one is west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly and explicitly states \"NO\" as\
        \ its final answer after comparing the locations and determining that LSSU\
        \ is west of Miami University Middletown (86.33\xB0W vs 84.38\xB0W)"

    50447bd0-9ae5-4e76-b8f9-817c406b1a86:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it says LSSU is "possibly slightly west or at a
        similar longitude" and concludes it's "more north and possibly slightly west
        or directly north." Since it mentions possible westward position and doesn't
        base its NO answer purely on equal positions, this doesn't qualify as a NO
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Lake Superior State University is located east of Miami University
        Middletown would be NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5df83bcc-afdb-41da-bec7-b4776e417e8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (LSSU being "northwest or north" of Miami University Middletown),
        not on the locations being equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model concludes that LSSU is "northwest or north" of Miami University
        Middletown, not east.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Lake Superior State University is "west and possibly slightly
        north" of Miami University Middletown. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two universities.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that LSSU is "west and north" and
        "more to the northwest or directly north" of Miami University Middletown.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer after analyzing
        the locations. The NO answer is given as a direct response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Lake Superior State University is west of Miami University Middletown.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Superior
        State University is west of Miami University Middletown, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Superior State University is east of Miami University
        Middletown. The model provides a step-by-step analysis leading to this definitive
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the classification criteria. The model's discussion of
        similar longitudes is irrelevant since it didn't give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after its analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite
        some discussion of similarities in location.

    5ec31dea-ba74-4109-87bd-5acd1fae13f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Florida National University would be west and south of
        Pfeiffer University, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Florida National University would be west and
        south of Pfeiffer University, not east.'

      result: 'NO'
    7d8c1054-4139-4db6-842f-be193bd7aec2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it discusses uncertainty about exact positions, complexity
        of state geometries, and the need for precise longitude data. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the inability to conclude that one is east of the other,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While the response includes a lot of uncertainty and caveats,
        it does conclude with a clear "NO" as its comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not relevant
        since the response didn't give a NO answer.

    e79a5b6c-46cd-4820-9cce-dcca02212253:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly stated that North Carolina
        (where Pfeiffer University is) is east of Florida (where Florida National
        University is), indicating a directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about their relative
        positions and suggests they could be in adjacent buildings or the same general
        area, but this is not presented as a statement of equality. The NO answer
        appears to be based on lack of definitive information rather than equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        after considering various factors. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as the final comparative result.

        close to each other" and "not significantly east or west of the other," it
        never explicitly states they are exactly equal or identical in position. The
        model actually indicates uncertainty about their exact relative positions,
        mentioning that one "might be slightly to the east." Since equality is not
        explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does not meet the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given based on the model's consideration of "typical
        configurations" rather than because the locations are identical. The model
        never claims the positions are equal or identical as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty about the locations throughout
        the analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        both institutions are in the same general area, it never explicitly states
        they are at exactly the same location or that equality is the reason for its
        NO answer. In fact, it suggests looking up exact addresses would be needed
        to determine relative positions. The NO appears to be given despite uncertainty
        rather than due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty and caveats throughout the analysis.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it only states they are in the same city but emphasizes it lacks information
        to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives a "NO" answer, it
        repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more precise information. The model states "we cannot definitively conclude
        their relative east-west positions without further information" and gives
        the NO answer while expressing uncertainty about making the comparison. This
        indicates the model is actually communicating it cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative NO.

        close to each other" and "essentially in the same location," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/identical in position, nor does it cite equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model actually emphasizes uncertainty
        about their relative positions rather than equality as the basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        and "not in different locations that would make one east of the other." This
        equality of location is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        for its NO answer. The model indicates that they share "the same city" and
        "same general area" and this equality is the primary basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer, even though it explains
        this is because they are in the same location.'

        Instead, it suggests there might be minor differences in location but that
        it lacks precise data to determine the direction. The NO answer appears to

        or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates that it lacks precise location
        data to make a detailed comparison within the city. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the inability to determine a clear east-west relationship rather
        than on proven equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through the reasoning steps. While it expresses

        more detailed geographical analysis would be needed and implies there could
        be differences in their positions within the city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        same city, it actually suggests they could have different positions within
        the city. The NO appears to be given due to insufficient information to verify
        the east-west relationship, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        NO answer. The model actually suggests there could be slight differences but
        lacks specific address information to determine the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative

        proximity and "essentially on the same east-west axis," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/identical as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it suggests there could be slight variations ("could be slightly

        The presence of any potential difference, even if slight, means this does
        not qualify as a pure equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" twice in
        its final statements, making this a clear NO answer. While it expresses some

        being equal - it explicitly states that Rochester (Kate Gleason) is east of
        Alfred University. The NO answer is given because the model determined Alfred
        University is west of Kate Gleason, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographic
        analysis that Alfred University is west of Kate Gleason College.

        Instead, it suggests they "might not have a significant east-west disparity"
        but still implies some difference exists. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the general positioning rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        "not significantly far apart" and are both in the downtown area, it does not
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the reasoning that City University is likely not east
        of Antioch, rather than them being in exactly the same location. The model
        acknowledges some uncertainty about precise positions but does not claim they
        are at the same exact location as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about exact locations, it provides
        this as a comparative result based on their downtown locations near the waterfront.
        The model does not reject the premises or indicate it cannot make the comparison
        - it makes a determination while acknowledging some uncertainty.

        saying CSU is "to the north and slightly west of Denver (where Regis University
        is located)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Fort Collins (CSU) is actually slightly
        west or more accurately northwest of Denver (Regis University)". This indicates
        a directional difference, even if described as "slight", which means the NO
        answer was not due to equal values.

        that the universities are at the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead,
        it indicates that CSU is "slightly more west than Denver" where Regis is located.
        Since it notes a difference in position (even if described as slight), this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, specifically addressing whether CSU is east of Regis University.
        The answer is clearly stated as a comparative result.

        (stating CSU is north of Regis), not on the locations being equal. The model
        never states that the east-west positions are equal/identical, only that the
        primary orientation is north-south.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether CSU is east of Regis University. The answer is given

        the same because Meadows School is part of SMU, it actually mentions that
        some Meadows facilities might be "slightly east of the central part of the
        SMU campus." This acknowledgment of potential slight differences, even if
        dismissed as a technicality, means the NO answer wasn't based on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing this as a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Meadows School is part of SMU rather than being independently located
        east of it.

        NO is explicitly based on them being at the same location, with no mention
        of any directional difference between them, even slight.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it explains this is because they
        are the same location/entity, it still gives a definitive NO rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        Arts is part of SMU and implies they share the same location, it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at exactly the same location as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it focuses on the relationship between the institutions and the lack
        of practical separation, without explicitly stating equality of position as
        the primary reason.

        and SMU are in "the same location" and are "essentially located in the same

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the reason given is that Meadows
        School is "part of" or "within" SMU, making a directional comparison invalid.
        This is a different type of reasoning than saying the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO answer is directly based on their identical location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold. While it explains that the comparison is complicated
        due to Meadows being part of SMU, it still gives a clear NO answer rather

        it's not possible to definitively say one is east of the other." This is a
        different reason than equality - it's about uncertainty of precise positions
        within the same region.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds caveats about the hypothetical nature of one institution. Since
        it provides a clear NO as a comparative result, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, even with the caveats.

        determine the relative positions due to incomplete information about one location
        and their presence in the same general area. The model discusses uncertainty
        and ambiguity rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        in the South Bay area and "could be quite close," it never explicitly states
        they are at the exact same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer
        appears to be based on uncertainty and lack of specific information rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises. While the model expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is "more south
        than directly east or west" and "slightly east but primarily south" of Wisconsin.
        Since it identifies directional differences (even if slight) and bases its
        NO answer on geographical relationships rather than equality, this is False.

        a difference (Clarion is "slightly west"). Since any stated difference, even
        if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, and this tiny
        westward difference is the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states that "it's not possible to definitively answer the question" and only
        provides NO because it was required to give a YES/NO answer. This indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a true NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Phillips University's location is northwest of Concordia University Texas's
        location, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer was given because northwest is "not east" rather than because
        the locations were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Phillips University''s

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Phillips University is "more to the north and slightly
        west" of Concordia University Texas. Even though the western difference is
        described as "slight," any stated difference means the locations are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the geographical positions of the two
        universities, concluding that Phillips University is "more to the north and
        slightly west, not east" of Concordia University Texas.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both colleges are on the
        same campus, it never explicitly states they are at the same location or have
        equal east-west positions. In fact, it emphasizes that it lacks information
        about their relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to confirm the comparison, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its definitive
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it
        provides this clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both colleges are likely
        on the main campus and close to each other, it does not explicitly state they
        are at the same location or equal distance. The NO answer appears to be based
        on lack of evidence for one being east of the other, rather than an explicit
        statement of equality. The model specifically mentions "without explicit details
        on the relative east-west positions" as the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as "the most straightforward answer." While the response includes
        caveats about uncertainty, it does make a clear NO determination rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        that the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates uncertainty
        about their relative positions and states it cannot definitively determine
        their locations. The NO is not based on equality of values but rather on inability
        to verify the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response as its final answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a definitive NO
        answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        lack of specific information to make the determination ("without specific
        details on the exact buildings or areas where these colleges are located,
        we cannot accurately determine their relative east-west positions"). The inability

        being exactly equal or the same. Instead, it suggests both colleges are on
        the same campus but doesn't explicitly state they're at the exact same location.
        The reasoning focuses on the question's premise being potentially flawed and
        the colleges being "on or near" the main campus, not on them being at identical
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. While the model expresses

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's
        University is "located west of" University of the Sciences, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO is based on one location being west of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.

        Sciences" and provides this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and describes Saint Joseph's as being "more to the northwest or west relative
        to the city's grid." Since it indicates a difference in position (even if

        to be based on this uncertainty rather than on any statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, with Bluffton University being northwest
        of Fort Valley State University. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The model concludes that Bluffton University is northwest of Fort
        Valley State University, not east.

        but makes its NO determination based on their relative positions, concluding
        that Bluffton is "not east" but "rather more north." The model acknowledges
        similar longitudinal positioning but does not claim they are exactly equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that ASU is west of Texas Tech University Center at Junction. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Angelo State University is east of Texas Tech University
        Center at Junction. The model provides a direct comparative result stating
        that ASU is west of the other location.

        that the locations were at the same position. Instead, it specifically indicated
        that San Angelo is "southwest of Junction" and is "not significantly east
        of Junction." The NO answer was based on directional difference (being southwest
        rather than east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the locations. The model is confident in its answer and provides specific
        directional information (stating San Angelo is southwest of Junction).

        location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear that it cannot determine the answer due to uncertainty about Cordoba
        University's existence and location. The model explicitly states "it's not

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies this
        by saying it cannot verify the existence/location of one of the institutions.

        and the possibility it could be west of Army Logistics University. The model
        never states the locations are the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot verify" the locations and "cannot definitively say" due to uncertainty
        about one location's existence. The model rejects the premise by questioning
        if one location exists. This makes it a case where the model cannot make the

        of one of the institutions being compared. The model explicitly states it
        "cannot accurately compare" the locations and that one institution might not

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the location of one
        of the institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that "a straightforward YES/NO answer cannot be accurately provided" and indicates
        it's only giving NO because the format requires a choice. The model also questions
        the existence/location of one of the institutions being compared. This makes
        it a case where the model is rejecting the premises/indicating it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the response never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is due to inability to confirm existence/location of one university
        and not being able to determine the relative positions. This makes it a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

        between the locations. The NO is based on the fact that one location is northwest
        of the other, not because they are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never claimed the locations
        were equal - in fact, it couldn't determine one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" the existence/location
        of Ralston College and "cannot definitively answer" the comparison. Although
        it ends with "NO", this NO is explicitly due to inability to verify/determine,
        not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        False. (Even if the model had compared the locations and found them equal,
        since it gave a YES answer, this must be False.)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges uncertainty and describes it as speculative. Since
        it did provide a clear YES answer despite its hesitation, we classify this
        as YES.

        location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does ultimately state "NO" as its
        final answer, this NO is explicitly given because it cannot verify or confirm
        the locations to make the comparison, not as a comparative result. The model
        repeatedly emphasizes the lack of verifiable information about Ralston College's

        NO appears to be based on the inability to determine relative positions due
        to lack of precise location data. The model specifically mentions that one
        would need to be east of the other and that they are merely in the same city,
        suggesting potential differences in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations
        and mentions both institutions could be in similar areas, it never explicitly
        states they are at the same location or that equality is the reason for the
        NO answer. The NO appears to be based more on inability to verify the eastern
        position rather than confirmed equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout
        the analysis. Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result, we classify
        this as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the model's expressed uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Corcoran would likely be southeast
        or south of Strayer University, which implies different positions. The NO
        answer is based on Corcoran not being directly east of Strayer, not because
        they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a comparative directional assessment. While it includes caveats
        about exact addresses, it still makes a clear directional determination based
        on general locations, so this counts as a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated that Corcoran is west of the Capitol and
        Strayer is "more central or slightly west/southwest," noting relative positions
        that differ. The NO answer was based on Corcoran not being east of Strayer,
        not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it suggests Corcoran is west of the Capitol while Strayer is downtown
        (west/central), implying a relative directional difference, even if approximate.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative directional answer, even while noting some uncertainty.
        The model does not reject the premises or indicate it cannot make the comparison
        - it provides a specific directional conclusion based on general locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Corcoran College is "slightly northwest"
        of Strayer University. The NO answer is given because Corcoran is northwest
        rather than east of Strayer, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on relative positions, not

        the "same east side of the San Francisco Bay," it does not state they are
        at the same longitude or exactly equal in east-west position. Instead, it
        explains the NO answer by describing their relative positions, with one being
        more north than the other. The equality of their eastern positions is not
        given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether California Maritime Academy is east of Patten University.
        The answer is clearly stated and presented as a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Vallejo is "north and slightly
        west of Oakland." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.

        noting that "Vallejo is generally north and slightly west of Oakland." Even
        though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparative question

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Cal Maritime is actually west/northwest of Patten University (not east),
        not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states "Oakland
        (Patten University) is generally east or southeast of Vallejo (California
        Maritime Academy)" indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
