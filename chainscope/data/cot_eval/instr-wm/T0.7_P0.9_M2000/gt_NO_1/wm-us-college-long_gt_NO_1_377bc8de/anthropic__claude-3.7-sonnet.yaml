        University's Illinois campus." Since it notes a directional difference (slightly
        west), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, College of Lake County

        that Addison (Chamberlain University) is "slightly west" compared to Grayslake
        (College of Lake County). The model concludes that "College of Lake County
        is located east of Chamberlain University's Illinois campus," indicating a
        directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        west of Grayslake" and then corrects itself to say that "Grayslake is actually
        northwest of Chicago" and "Addison is west of Chicago but east of Grayslake."
        The model is indicating a difference in positions, not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "College of Lake County is actually located
        north and slightly west of Chamberlain University's Illinois campus." This
        indicates a specific directional difference (west rather than east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer to the comparison
        question. However, there's a contradiction in the response. In Step 4, it
        states "Grayslake is further east than Addison" but then in the final answer
        it states "College of Lake County is not located east of Chamberlain University.
        It's actually located north and slightly west..." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's explicit final answer is "NO" to the comparison question.

        is not located east of Chamberlain University" but then corrects itself after
        "double-checking" and concludes with "YES, College of Lake County is located
        east of Chamberlain University, IL." Since the final explicit answer is YES,

        or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Pharmacy is "northeast"
        of the School of Public Health, with its position being "more significantly
        north rather than east." This indicates a difference in location, not equality,
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy is located east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "the College of
        Pharmacy is actually slightly WEST of the School of Public Health, not east."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (slightly west vs. east),
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different directional relationship,
        stating "It is actually located west of the School of Public Health." This
        indicates the locations are different (opposite directions), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the University of
        Michigan College of Pharmacy is not located east of the University of Michigan
        School of Public Health." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two locations
        have different positions, with the School of Public Health being "more to
        the east" and the College of Pharmacy being "west of the School of Public
        Health." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the two University of Michigan institutions
        and determining that the College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public
        Health, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "the College of Pharmacy is south and slightly east of the School
        of Public Health." The NO answer is given because the primary directional
        relationship is south (with only a slight eastern component), making it inaccurate
        to describe it as simply "east of" the School of Public Health.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that it would not be accurate
        to describe the College of Pharmacy as simply "east of" the School of Public
        Health because it is "slightly east but primarily south" of the School of
        Public Health.

        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        its error in the initial reasoning and provided a revised analysis that led
        to the "YES" conclusion.

        as the reason for its NO answer, stating that the College of Pharmacy is "north/northeast"
        of the School of Public Health rather than east. This indicates a difference
        in location/direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer, indicating that the University of Michigan College of
        Pharmacy is not located east of the University of Michigan School of Public
        Health. The model provides a clear comparative result.

        Health (not east). The model says "Rather, it's the opposite - the School
        of Public Health is east of the College of Pharmacy." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that University
        of the Southwest is west of National American University, not east. The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that University of the Southwest
        is west of National American University (not east), and therefore answered
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether University of the Southwest
        is east of National American University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the School of Library
        & Information Studies is west of the College of Social Sciences, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. The model concludes that the School of Library
        & Information Studies is not east of the College of Social Sciences because
        it is west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        sense because the College of Health and Human Services is a subset of Eastern
        Michigan University, not that they are at the same location. The model argues
        that "the university as a whole encompasses the College of Health and Human
        Services" and "the university is not a single point but an area that includes
        all of its colleges and buildings." This is a rejection of the comparison's
        validity rather than a statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Eastern Michigan University
        cannot be east of one of its own colleges because the college is part of the
        university itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison doesn't make
        logical sense because EMU CHHS is a part of EMU, with the college being located
        within the university campus. The model is rejecting the comparison based
        on a containment relationship (one being part of the other), not because they
        have equal geographical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan
        University is not located east of Eastern Michigan University College of Health

        geographical sense because the College of Health and Human Services is a part
        of Eastern Michigan University and located within the university's campus.
        The model is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally
        in this way, not stating they have equal values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        "the College of Health and Human Services is part of Eastern Michigan University
        and located within its campus." This indicates a containment relationship
        rather than equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eastern Michigan

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the College of Health and
        Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan University and is located within
        the university's geographical boundaries. The model's reasoning is that it's
        impossible for the university to be east of one of its own components, not
        that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides reasoning about why Eastern
        Michigan University cannot be east of one of its own colleges, concluding
        with a clear "NO" answer.

        The model argues that it's a category error to compare the entire university
        to one of its constituent colleges. This is not claiming equality of values
        but rather explaining a different reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

        the university campus. The model argues that it's not logically possible for
        the entire university to be east of one of its own components. This is not
        an equality-based reason but rather a containment/part-whole relationship
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Eastern Michigan

        way - they are essentially at the same location." This equality (being at
        the same location) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Eastern Michigan

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison
        doesn't make sense because the College of Health and Human Services is part
        of Eastern Michigan University and located on the EMU campus. The model argues
        that "it doesn't make sense to say that the entire university is east of one
        of its own colleges" because "The university encompasses the college, rather
        than being positioned relative to it." This is a logical/categorical reason
        for the NO answer, not an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides reasoning about why it doesn't

      explanation_equal_values: The model explains that its NO answer is because "Franklin
        College is actually a part of the University of Georgia, not a separate institution.
        They share the same location." The model explicitly states they "share the
        same location" and "share the same physical location on the same campus,"

        of UGA, not a separate institution with its own distinct location. The reason
        for the NO is not that they have identical coordinates, but rather that the
        premise of the comparison is flawed because one is contained within the other.

        \ relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked (Cincinnati is east\
        \ of Southern Polytechnic, not the other way around)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Southern Polytechnic
        State University in Georgia is NOT located east of University of Cincinnati

        This is a case where the model is rejecting the premise of the question because

        The model is not claiming equality of position but rather a specific directional
        relationship (east of). The NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "They are at similar longitudes,
        with Southwestern Oklahoma State possibly being slightly west of University
        of Jamestown." The mention of "slightly west" indicates a difference in values,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        State University is not located east of University of Jamestown." This is

        equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it notes they are "very
        close in terms of longitude" and "approximately at the same longitude," it
        specifically states that "Southwestern Oklahoma State University is slightly
        to the west of University of Jamestown" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model identifies a directional difference (slightly west), not equality, as
        the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Southwestern Oklahoma
        State University is not located east of University of Jamestown" in its final
        answer. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        the same longitude, with SWOSU being slightly west." The model identifies
        a difference in position (SWOSU being slightly west), which is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because they are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Southwestern Oklahoma
        State University in Oklahoma is not located east of University of Jamestown
        in North Dakota." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        then immediately clarifies that this is based on "insufficient information
        to determine their exact relative positions." This indicates the model is
        actually saying it cannot determine the answer rather than making a definitive

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that South University
        is located WEST of Ralston College, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with South University being southwest of Ralston College, and Ralston
        College being northeast of South University. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether South University is east of Ralston College. The
        model concludes that South University cannot be east of Ralston College because
        South University is southwest of Ralston College (which is in downtown Savannah).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Ralston College being east of South University. The model
        says "Ralston College is east of South University" as the reason for its NO
        answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of its final answer, but it's rejecting the premise of the question by explaining
        that "California State University, CA" is not a single location but a system
        with multiple campuses. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer begins with "NO" but then
        explains that it cannot accurately answer the question because "California
        State University, CA" refers to a system with multiple locations. The model
        is rejecting the premise of the question by indicating that one of the entities
        being compared (CSU as a single location) doesn't exist as such. This makes

        state that Whitacre College of Engineering is east of Texas Tech University
        College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources..." This is not a definitive
        NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model cannot determine

        of the values being compared. However, it immediately contradicts this by
        adding "with Calvary possibly being slightly west of Missouri Southern State
        University." Since the model notes a potential directional difference (even
        if described as slight), this does not qualify as stating the values are exactly
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its final answer paragraph, indicating that Calvary University is not east

        east. The model explicitly states "Corcoran is NOT east of Strayer; rather,
        Corcoran is west of Strayer." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        NW, and concludes that Corcoran is west of Strayer (not east). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Corcoran College

        is actually west of Patten University." The model indicates a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether California Maritime Academy is east of Patten University. The model

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "California Maritime Academy
        is slightly west of Patten University's location in Oakland." This indicates
        a difference in position (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that California Maritime
        Academy is "west of Patten University" and that "Vallejo is to the north and
        slightly WEST of Oakland." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether California Maritime Academy is east of Patten University. The model
        clearly concludes that "California Maritime Academy is NOT east of Patten
        University" and reinforces this with "California Maritime Academy is west
        of Patten University."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cal Maritime is
        actually slightly west of Patten University," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. It first
        states "NO, California Maritime Academy is not located east of Patten University"
        but then concludes "Cal Maritime is actually slightly west of Patten University."
        The first part suggests a NO answer to whether Cal Maritime is east of Patten,
        while the second part (saying it's west) actually confirms the NO. Despite
        the confusion in the explanation, the model explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer.

        indicating a difference in their locations. The model gives a NO answer despite
        finding a difference, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which contradicts its own analysis that "Oregon College of Oriental
        Medicine is located east of where Marylhurst University was located." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        saying "OCOM is on the east side of Portland, and Marylhurst is located southwest
        of Portland, OCOM is indeed east of Marylhurst University." The model's reasoning
        indicates a directional difference (east vs. southwest), not equality, as
        the basis for its NO answer. This appears to be contradictory to its conclusion,
        but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions in the model's response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
