        Pharmacy) is west of Washington Heights (School of Public Health), indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "the University of
        Michigan College of Pharmacy is not located east of the University of Michigan
        School of Public Health."

        saying the College of Pharmacy is "more to the south or slightly southwest"
        relative to the School of Public Health. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        or location. Instead, it indicates there might be some difference ("any difference
        would likely be negligible") but lacks specific data to measure it. The NO
        answer is based on the differences being too small to be "meaningful" rather
        than on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Lincoln College
        is not located east of Lincoln Christian University" - this is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question, even though it includes caveats about
        the small scale.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions without more specific details.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but indicates
        it cannot determine the relationship due to lack of specific location details.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        Hartford (72.685W) is slightly further west than Johnson (72.673W). It explicitly
        notes a difference in values, even though small, rather than stating they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Since it identifies a directional difference (even if slight), this is not
        a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer. In fact, the slight

        is "part of" and "within" SMU, which is a different relationship than equality.
        The reason for NO is that one entity is contained within the other, not that
        they have equal locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the Center for Politics is west of the main campus
        where the IRC is located, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        one is west of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, the University of Virginia
        Center for Politics is not located east of the International Residential College"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that the Center for Politics is west of the IRC (indicating different locations),
        which is why it answered NO to whether the Center is east of the IRC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Center for Politics is west of the IRC (not east
        as asked in the question). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

    595f007e-ff3b-4310-9ecf-90ddea4e8197:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, with the Center for Politics being "west" of the
        IRC, which is described as "more central or slightly east." This difference
        in position, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that the Center for Politics is not east of the IRC. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined the
        Center for Politics is "north and somewhat west of the IRC," indicating a
        directional difference. It did not state the locations were equal or the same
        in terms of their east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Center for Politics is "north and somewhat west
        of the IRC" rather than east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Center for Politics is west of IRC), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that the Center for Politics is west
        of the IRC (not east as asked in the question). This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.

    9c76ff01-228a-4312-bec8-0ecc61ff774f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Crestwood Drive is west of Emmet Street" and
        concludes the Center for Politics is west of the IRC. This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that the Center for Politics is west of the IRC (not
        east as asked in the question). This is a direct NO comparative answer.

    a6898dd6-4229-4856-973b-d6b8ca1aa54e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying the Center for Politics is "west
        of" the International Residential College. The NO answer was given because
        the question asked if it was "east of" and the model determined it was actually
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that the Center for Politics is west of the International Residential College.

        a directional difference ("further to the west"), so this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the same city (Savannah), it does not explicitly state that they are at exactly
        the same longitude or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Being
        in the same city does not necessarily mean exact same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Whitacre being west of the other college), not because the locations are
        the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative directional assessment, indicating that Whitacre

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be determined without
        additional specific campus layout information." This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot make the determination due to lack of information,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        is) is "to the north and slightly to the east of Joplin" but concludes NO
        primarily because the north-south difference is more significant than the
        east-west difference ("primarily it is more to the north"). This is a comparison
        showing difference, not equality.

        indicated the locations were equal - it stated one location couldn't be determined
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by explaining that one location cannot be determined because Apollos University
        doesn't have a specific California location. This makes it a rejection of
        the premises rather than a comparative result, falling under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        indicate the locations were equal - it actually indicated they were in different
        states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one institution is not in California as assumed. When a model rejects the
        premises or indicates the comparison cannot be made due to invalid assumptions,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than taking the explicit "NO"
        at face value.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question as
        stated cannot be answered with a simple YES or NO" and explains that since
        one location doesn't have a physical campus in California, a direct comparison
        cannot be made. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Loyola is "further west" than downtown and ICO is "east of where
        Loyola University Chicago is located" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, both as part of a complete sentence and as a bold standalone
        answer. This is a clear comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response was describing differences in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it describes
        the relative positions of both institutions, it does not make an explicit
        final comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly states they are at different locations (15th St vs
        17th St) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Corcoran College
        of Art and Design is not located east of Strayer University" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        directional difference (Corcoran is west of Strayer, not east), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position based on street numbers (17th St vs 15th St).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Thus, the answer to the
        question is: NO" after determining that Corcoran is west (not east) of Strayer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Corcoran
        is west of Strayer (on 17th St vs 15th St), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Corcoran is west (not east) of Strayer University.

    7622a7fc-53ab-4c0c-aaf8-5941e51dc445:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Corcoran is west of Strayer, on 17th Street
        vs 15th Street). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Corcoran College is west of Strayer University, not
        east as asked in the question. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a5c28008-028b-4320-86e7-ab144e941c3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Corcoran being west of Strayer), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in street numbers
        (17th vs 15th) and concludes one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Corcoran is west (not east)
        of Strayer University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality or inequality in the locations described.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out the locations and information needed
        for comparison but never actually provided an explicit YES/NO conclusion about
        whether Corcoran is east of Strayer. While it provided the street numbers
        that could lead to a conclusion, it didn't state one.

        were different (Corcoran on 17th St NW vs Strayer on 15th St NW), not because
        they were equal. The model explicitly states one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Corcoran
        is west of Strayer (not east as asked in the question).

    d0997aa0-cd8f-495a-9815-52cc61fc4117:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Corcoran is west of Strayer, with 17th St vs 15th
        St). The NO is not due to the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather
        due to finding a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Corcoran College is west (not east) of Strayer University.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        difference (Corcoran being west of Strayer), not because the locations were
        equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference in location (17th
        St vs 15th St).
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear, explicit "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations and determining that Corcoran is west
        (not east) of Strayer.

    ff4836e5-182c-4719-b3eb-8fa005ecf4b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Corcoran being west of Strayer (since it's
        on 17th St NW while Strayer is on 15th St NW, which the model notes is "to
        the east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, directly answering whether Corcoran is east of Strayer.
        The model provides a clear comparative analysis and concludes that Corcoran
        is west (not east) of Strayer.
