      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        Pharmacy building is west of the Public Health building, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("the Pharmacy building
        is west of the Public Health building").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis that the Pharmacy
        building is west of the Public Health building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - the model explicitly states that
        the College of Pharmacy is WEST of the School of Public Health, indicating
        a directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on finding that one location
        is west of the other (opposite to what was asked)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm the
        east/west positioning with certainty)" which is explicitly indicating it cannot
        determine the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and then says "NO (because I cannot confirm the east-west
        positioning with certainty)". This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        the model discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and concludes "I do not have enough information to determine
        this with certainty." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient data.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion
        of both institutions being in the same town is not relevant since it didn't
        give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it would need more precise geographical information
        to make a determination. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying University of the Southwest "is actually west of National
        American University." The NO is based on the direction being opposite to what
        was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that University
        of the Southwest is west (not east) of National American University.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one institution was
        west of the other). The model explicitly states "Since it is actually west,
        not east, the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical positions. The

        a difference in location. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is based on a direct geographical comparison (west

        as a comparative result. The model clearly states "Without a precise campus
        map in front of me, I cannot definitively state their exact relative positions."
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison, which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it refused to make any comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty." This is
        a clear case of the model refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the reasoning is that something
        cannot be east of itself as a matter of logical impossibility. The model doesn't
        make any claims about equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        "essentially at the same location" and "the location is not east of itself,"
        using this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        indicate any directional difference between the locations.

        be east or west of each other", leading to the NO answer. This is a clear
        case where the NO answer is based on the locations being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "they are essentially at the
        same location" and uses this sameness of location as the primary reason for
        its NO answer ("since both the university and the college are located at the
        same campus"). The NO is explicitly based on their identical location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again in the final "Answer: NO" statement. This is a

        Services and EMU are "essentially at the same location" and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, explaining that a location cannot
        be east of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "they are essentially
        the same place" and indicates that the locations are "identical" as the reason
        for its answer. This equality is presented as the primary basis for the NO
        response, with the model explaining that one location cannot be east or west
        of the other because they are the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially suggests the question cannot be meaningfully
        answered. Since we must classify based on the explicit final answer given,
        this is classified as NO.

    d00be563-5cd0-4c08-aa21-a333cac6cd19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Instead, it reasons that since one location
        is a building within the other location, it's logically impossible for the
        university to be east of a building that's part of itself. This is a different
        type of reasoning than stating the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that something
        cannot be east of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "essentially at the same
        location" and uses this as the basis for its NO answer. The equality of location
        is explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the negative response
        (along with the logical impossibility of something being east of itself).

    dbb4a8d6-1631-4930-bbc0-4ec2cc345b0a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this NO means it "cannot confirm with 100% certainty." This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the relationship, making this a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model specifically states "University of West Los Angeles
        is west of Columbia College Hollywood."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting
        that "Tarzana is slightly east of Woodland Hills" and concludes that "University
        of West Los Angeles is located west of Columbia College Hollywood". The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        was explicitly stated to be "northwest of" the other, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one being west of
        the other). The model explicitly states a difference in relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that University of West Los
        Angeles is west (not east) of Columbia College Hollywood.

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Columbia College
        Hollywood is east of University of West Los Angeles, indicating different
        positions. The NO is given because their relative positions are opposite to
        what was asked in the question.

        exactly the same as SMU's location" and "it cannot be east or west of SMU
        - it is at the same location." The NO answer is directly based on this equality
        of location, making this a clear case where the NO is due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it explains that while both are on the same campus,
        Meadows School is specifically located west of the main campus, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to the position question, not a
        refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    919ee7d0-48f8-4034-af13-39fc05330d94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the locations are the
        same because Meadows is part of SMU's campus, it doesn't explicitly state
        they are "equal" or "the same" in terms of east/west position as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it explains that the comparison itself
        is problematic because one is part of the other, making it a different type
        of reasoning than pure equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it initially explains why the comparison is problematic.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are part
        of the same campus, it explicitly states that Meadows is located to the west
        of the main campus. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (west vs east), not because the locations are the same. The model actually
        emphasizes a specific directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that
        Meadows is "located to the west of the main campus core" and "NOT east of
        Southern Methodist University."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Jacksonville, TX (location of Lon Morris College) is west of Ottawa, KS (location
        of Ottawa University), indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that Lon Morris College is west of Ottawa University,
        not east. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that "Jacksonville, TX is
        west of Ottawa, KS" and concludes NO because one location is west of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and provides a direct comparative result based on geographic positions,

        Morris College is west of Ottawa University ("Jacksonville, TX is further
        west than Ottawa, KS"), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lon Morris College
        is west of Ottawa University ("Texas is located west of Kansas" and "Jacksonville,
        TX is west of Ottawa, KS"). The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Enid is northwest
        of Austin, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing Enid is northwest of Austin, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Phillips University is west (not east) of Concordia University Texas, not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Phillips University is west of Concordia University") as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the geographical
        relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Enid
        is "northwest of Austin" and therefore "NOT east of Austin". The answer is
        based on a directional difference, not on the locations being equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result about the
        geographical relationship between the locations (not being east of each other),
        even though one location no longer exists.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Enid being west of Austin), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis showing that Phillips University
        (in Enid) is west of Concordia University (in Austin), not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Phillips University was explicitly stated to be northwest of Concordia University
        Texas, indicating a directional difference. The model did not claim the locations
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis showing Phillips University
        was northwest of Concordia University Texas. While the model notes Phillips
        University no longer exists, it makes its comparison based on when it did
        exist, providing a definitive directional comparison.'

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Phillips University was WEST of Concordia University Texas, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer was given because the direction
        was opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison finding

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that since one institution no
        longer exists, it cannot determine the relative locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to inability to verify one location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Phillips University is west (not east) of Concordia University Texas, not
        because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Phillips University is west of Concordia University Texas").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Phillips
        University is west of Concordia University Texas, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in its reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative directional claim (stating Phillips is west of Concordia)
        and uses this to definitively answer NO to whether Phillips is east of Concordia.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The model states "the College of Health and Human Sciences is
        located west of the College of Agriculture."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a

        values consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to
        incorrect premises about location. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        equal values - it actually indicated it couldn't make the comparison at all
        due to invalid location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED." The model rejects
        the premise by noting that one of the locations is incorrect (Wilkes University
        is not in Mesa, AZ).

        was incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question due
        to incorrect location information and explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO." While it adds "If I must choose, I would say NO," this
        NO is based on rejecting the premise rather than making a comparative determination.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question."

        claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in entirely
        different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to rejecting the premise of the question (incorrect location
        information) rather than making a geographic comparison. When a model rejects
        the premises, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Prescott, AZ being west of Pennsylvania), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare
        them due to an incorrect premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot provide a confident YES
        or NO" and when forced gives a NO only because the premise is incorrect. This
        is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their positions because one location wasn't in Arizona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the relative positioning and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO." Although
        it ends with "NO," this NO is given only because it feels forced to provide
        YES/NO, while clearly indicating it cannot make the determination. The model
        also rejects the premise by stating one university is not in Arizona. This
        fits the UNKNOWN criteria.

    e4b7aaad-9298-430e-ad40-16cfd35b3219:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was given because one
        location was stated to be incorrect (Wilkes University being in Pennsylvania
        rather than Arizona). The model never states the locations are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing reservations about the premise. While it notes the question
        has flawed premises, it does provide a clear NO rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        that it cannot make the comparison due to incorrect location data. Since the
        model rejects the premises of the question and states it "cannot be definitively
        answered," this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" being present.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't determine
        their relative positions due to uncertainty about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it mentions "If forced to choose, I would lean towards YES," this is
        explicitly presented as speculation without confidence. The model states it
        "cannot confidently answer the question" and "cannot responsibly give a definitive
        answer." This indicates inability to make the comparison.

        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        University is west of Ohio Dominican University, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer YES
        or NO" and rejects the premise since the universities don't exist. This fits
        the UNKNOWN criteria where the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their locations
        because the institutions don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot determine the comparison because the universities don't exist. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their existence
        or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer this with certainty)"
        and indicates it cannot verify the existence of the institutions. This is
        effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT BE DETERMINED"
        and explains it cannot definitively answer YES or NO because the universities
        in question don't exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question, making it an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values since it rejected the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the locations (Cordoba University) doesn't exist, and explicitly states
        it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot answer this question with a definitive YES or NO" because it rejects
        the premises (stating the universities don't exist). This fits the criteria
        for UNKNOWN where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make a comparison
        of equal values - it instead stated it couldn't make the comparison at all
        due to non-existent institutions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot verify the comparison since the universities don't
        exist. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to uncertainty about the institutions' existence/locations. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that SLU
        is west of Jackson State, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states "SLU is actually west of Jackson State, not east"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether one location is east of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "St. Louis, MO
        is north and west of Jackson, MS" and concludes that Saint Louis University
        is "NOT east of Jackson State University" because of this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific geographical coordinates and
        directional reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that SLU is northwest
        of Jackson State University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that SLU is northwest
        of Jackson State University and therefore not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ difference between the locations, only noting a north-south difference which\
        \ is not relevant to the east-west comparison."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether SLU is east of Jackson State. This is an explicit
        comparative NO answer.

        west of Jackson" and that Saint Louis University is NOT east of Jackson State
        University. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        Saint Louis University is "north and west" rather than east of Jackson State
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal in position. While it notes they are "very close" and in the same town,
        it specifically states it "cannot confirm the east-west positioning with certainty."
        The NO answer is based on inability to verify the positioning, not on equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While it shows hesitation
        earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO response.

        never gave a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether equal values
        were cited as a reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positioning. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the model did note the schools were "essentially at the same location," this
        is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to the question" and indicates it lacks sufficient information

        make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        positions couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying it's because it "cannot confirm with certainty."

        the same, only that they are "very close" to each other in Newton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position (south vs. north) and uses this as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative response after its step-by-step
        reasoning.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" because one of the
        institutions doesn't exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as
        the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one location
        cannot be verified.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this NO is explicitly
        given because it "cannot confidently determine the precise east/west positioning."
        This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        the locations are different, with Calvary University being west of Missouri
        Southern State University.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Calvary University is west (not east)
        of Missouri Southern State University.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with certainty" due to
        lack of location data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Orange is west
        of Duarte," indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative result based on geographical positions, indicating
        that one location is west of the other rather than east.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot verify the locations.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the relationship. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO comparative result.

        is "north and slightly west of UIC" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO is due to finding a different relative position than
        what was asked about, not because the locations are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Vallejo (Maritime
        Academy) is west of Oakland (Patten University), indicating a difference in
        location. The NO answer was given because one location was west of the other,
        not because they were at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Vallejo being northwest of Oakland), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Kansas State University is west of Midland University (not east), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability
        to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Kansas State University is west of Midland University, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographic
        analysis that Kansas State University is west of Midland University, not east.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Kansas
        State University is west of Midland University, not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Kansas State University is west of
        Midland University" indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison step-by-step.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        KSU was explicitly stated to be west of Midland University, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined KSU is west of Midland University, therefore
        concluding it is NOT east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that KSU
        is west of Midland University, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Manhattan,
        KS is west of Fremont, NE"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that KSU is west (not east)
        of Midland University. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        KSU was explicitly stated to be west of Midland University, indicating a difference
        in position. The model clearly states "Manhattan, KS is west of Fremont, NE"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model states that KSU is west of Midland University, therefore
        it cannot be east of it.
