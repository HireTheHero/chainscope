    0ebd375d-fe42-4ebb-b5ed-2ddd3286a6ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that LSSU is west of
        Miami University Middletown, indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether LSSU is east of Miami University Middletown, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    14bbac9b-73bf-42f1-9abd-f314136a75a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning steps that lead to "NO" based
        on relative geographical positions, with LSSU being described as west of MUM.
        The NO answer appears to be incorrect given the model's own reasoning, but
        we must evaluate only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps about the locations of the universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    17464ea8-8425-4e66-a0e6-359713a0db62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being different, noting
        that one is "significantly west" of the other. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its geographical reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    183b1636-d0df-4ab9-b42f-045b373a6430:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that while Michigan is west of Ohio
        and the UP curves eastward, it's "not far enough east to surpass the longitude
        of southwestern Ohio." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1eb844ec-4a6a-49c2-a3b3-1058c7d14249:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it actually described
        LSSU as being west of Miami University Middletown ("Michigan is generally
        west of Ohio" and "LSSU is *west* of Miami University Middletown"), yet still
        concluded "NO". While this seems contradictory, we must evaluate based on
        what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its comparative analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    84773d08-c92c-4279-9fb7-d0e4da9c39ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on LSSU being west
        of MUM (due to Michigan being west of Ohio), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether LSSU is east of MUM, after reasoning about their relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c41b8bd3-8e75-4988-aec3-ca41ff854938:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it provides geographical reasoning about relative positions
        and concludes NO. The response actually argues about relative positions (one
        being in Michigan's UP, one being in southwestern Ohio) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cab6b885-0a9d-426d-b732-640607ef17f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that LSSU is "definitely west of
        Middletown" and concludes that LSSU is west of Miami University Middletown
        before giving its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee030054-b744-476b-8341-4aabbd1298cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it concludes that LSSU is west of Miami University
        Middletown, and gives NO as its answer. The model does not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f9b7f583-a0c8-4b70-a19b-5a8e243cf3b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in any way. Instead, it describes their relative
        positions (LSSU in Michigan's UP, Miami in southwestern Ohio) and concludes
        NO, implying some other reason for the negative answer rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification rules, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its
        final conclusion, after reasoning through the locations and determining that
        Florida is east of North Carolina.'

    52259aab-baeb-4a5b-8bc8-5f57684ab5b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually concluded that one location was
        definitively east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after working through the geographical relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Miami, Florida is east of Misenheimer,
        North Carolina.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Grayslake is "notably northwest
        of Addison," indicating a difference in position. This directional difference,
        not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    09c8eaa4-42ac-4fcf-8c4e-ab54b50949bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Grayslake is north and slightly
        west of Addison" - indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any qualifications or uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2f075d78-e34c-412b-b00f-f0d8ec8ddd93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Grayslake is "west of Addison" and concludes
        College of Lake County is "west of Chamberlain University". The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    31423232-7adc-4e6d-a30c-b7c5ff2bb46c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Grayslake, IL is west of
        Addison, IL" indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9d92986-af4f-4129-8ad6-f67803ddcef0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Grayslake is "northwest of Downers
        Grove," indicating a directional difference between the locations. Even though
        this might not directly answer an east/west comparison, the model noted a
        directional difference rather than equality as its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bc0cda6a-2eef-4254-855a-187c4e276f61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Grayslake, IL is west of Addison, IL,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Grayslake
        is west of Addison.

      result: 'NO'
    cae2a2bf-5f50-4d4b-9cd8-cdef249913d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined College of Lake County
        is actually west of Chamberlain's campuses, not east. The model specifically
        noted directional differences, stating Lake County is "north and west of the
        Chicago area" where Chamberlain's campuses are located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the institutions, making
        a clear comparative judgment about their locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e9acb563-895d-4bfd-bb76-1197f4168884:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that "Addison is generally
        west of Grayslake" and uses this directional difference to conclude NO. Since
        it indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public Health, not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining the relative positions of the buildings, where

    1f8312df-33f9-4065-ae04-a0f34151f54f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both institutions are part of the University
        of Michigan, the model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("College of Pharmacy is slightly northeast of the School of Public Health").
        Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means the locations
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative locations, indicating the
        College of Pharmacy is slightly northeast of the School of Public Health.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Although the model notes the locations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states there is a difference in position (College of Pharmacy
        is "slightly west" of the School of Public Health). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the College of Pharmacy is slightly west of the School

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the buildings are close and
        on the same campus, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (slightly northeast vs directly east). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the buildings being in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the buildings, determining that

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the College of Pharmacy is west
        of the School of Public Health, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after determining
        that the College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public Health. This
        is a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        are described as being "very close," any stated directional difference means
        we must classify this as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated there was a directional difference ("slightly
        east"). The NO was given because this eastward difference was deemed not significant
        enough, not because the locations were identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating City University is not east of Antioch University.
        While it noted "slightly east," it determined this wasn't significant enough
        to warrant a YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that City University of Seattle
        is west of Antioch University Seattle, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that City University of Seattle is west of
        Antioch University Seattle.

    850bca11-069d-4c08-8231-c33ddb6f4120:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states one is "slightly east" of the
        other. The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning that while there is
        an eastward difference, it's not "primarily" east due to being "significantly
        south".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Belltown is generally west of Wallingford,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Belltown is west of Wallingford.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Belltown being west/southwest of Wallingford), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that City University is west of Antioch University, making
        a clear comparative directional statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that one location is "slightly east" of the other (even though it considers
        this secondary to the north-south difference). Any stated difference, even
        if described as "slight," means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question
        rather than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "New Mexico is significantly
        west of South Dakota" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a clear
        difference in position (not equality) as the basis for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "New Mexico is significantly west of
        South Dakota." This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

    5c9a87d6-57cf-42c5-be09-79d17abb8045:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated there was a difference, stating
        "New Mexico is considerably west of South Dakota" and concluding "USW is west
        of NAU" before giving its NO answer. While there appears to be an inconsistency
        between the directional reasoning and the final NO answer, we must take the
        NO at face value without trying to resolve the contradiction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that USW (in New Mexico) is west
        of NAU (in South Dakota), therefore USW cannot be east of NAU.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that New Mexico is west of South Dakota,
        and therefore USW is west of NAU, yet still gave a NO answer. While this seems
        contradictory with its reasoning, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly
        stated, not logical consistency.

        "Wisconsin is further west than Alabama" and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        they "might be slightly offset". The NO answer appears to be based on the
        reasoning that they're too close to warrant a directional designation, not
        because they're in exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        argues that using east/west directions isn't a practical way to describe relative
        locations within a campus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        The model explicitly notes a directional difference, even though it's described
        as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that SLIS is slightly west of Bellamy, providing a definitive
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot determine the relative positions without
        more specific location information. This is a clear indication that the model
        cannot make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    dbd816ae-f39f-40b3-8f13-002f65db1e21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.

    ee004fe1-e7ae-41e4-8193-fdbdcfa2ae0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the buildings are close together,
        it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it acknowledges one might be "slightly east of
        the other" but argues this difference isn't meaningful enough to matter. Since
        it acknowledges a potential difference, even if slight, this doesn't qualify
        as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f396b907-415f-4ba4-9089-1c61dc8ee2b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the School of Library & Information
        Studies is west of the College of Social Sciences, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that one location is west of the other
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4a9959a-bb12-4b21-a0fb-ed1b5679050a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that one location is "slightly northeast" of
        the other, indicating a directional difference. Even though they are described
        as "very close," any stated directional difference means we must classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        rather than a rejection of ability to compare or premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values/locations are equal or the same. Instead, it rejected the
        premise of the comparison by explaining that one entity cannot be directionally
        compared to its own part. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that one entity
        cannot be directionally related to a part of itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cb10787-ddd4-4408-b44f-5c087a05eae5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes that the two locations are
        actually the same place (since one is part of the other), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are "equal" or "the same" as its primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, it uses the logical argument that "something cannot be east of itself"
        as the primary reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the logical reasoning that
        something cannot be east of itself.

    5556b0cd-c869-4402-bf52-fe71034bdb59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it argues that something cannot be east of itself and that
        a college within a university shares the "same general location," but this
        is presented as a logical impossibility rather than an equality statement.
        The reasoning is about logical impossibility rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making this a clear NO answer based on logical
        reasoning about locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ef74c2e-45bd-4180-81e7-38db33fd7a7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it argues that as CHHS is a part of EMU,
        it cannot be east of the whole university. This is a logical relationship
        argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its logical reasoning about
        parts and wholes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer: that it''s
        logically impossible for a university to be directionally separate from one
        of its constituent parts. Since this is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a different logical argument, this should be classified as False.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on the logical impossibility of a university being
        east of one of its own colleges.

    6bc696e1-f4dd-4dbe-a093-e7ffcfef76d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO because the locations
        are technically the same entity (one being part of the other), it doesn't
        explicitly state that the locations are at exactly/approximately equal coordinates.
        The reasoning is based on logical impossibility ("something cannot be east
        of itself") rather than explicitly stating equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that something
        cannot be east of itself.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it argues that the comparison is invalid because one entity
        is part of the other and "something cannot be east of itself." This is a logical
        impossibility argument, not an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    c0f6308a-fa6d-46d5-b4b1-8d9655fc6b0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that since one location is part of the other,
        directional comparison is logically impossible ("Something cannot be located
        east of itself"). This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical premise
        that something cannot be located east of itself, implying they are in the
        exact same location because they are the same entity. The model explicitly
        states "something cannot be located east of itself" as the reason, indicating
        the locations are identical because they are the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is that something "cannot be
        east of itself" because they are the same entity (the College is part of EMU).
        This indicates the locations are identical/the same, and this sameness is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model uses this
        information along with the latitude difference to conclude that Hartford is
        NOT east of Johnson. Since the longitudes are described as "almost" and "approximately"
        the same (rather than exactly equal) and this similarity is not the sole reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Culver City is generally
        west of Hollywood," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "Inglewood is west of Hollywood" and concludes that University of West Los
        Angeles is west, not east, of Columbia College Hollywood. The NO is due to
        this directional difference, not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that University of West Los Angeles is west, not east, of Columbia
        College Hollywood.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are the same
        ("is part of" and "is at"), this is not given as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model's reasoning is based on the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself, which is a different type of reasoning
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7b66dfc-84a8-4f03-9966-361fdc7ba73e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logic that Meadows
        School is part of SMU and therefore can't be east of it, not because the locations
        are exactly the same. While it states Meadows is "at" SMU, this is used to
        explain why it can't be "east of" rather than to indicate equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in step 3, and this is given as a direct comparative result rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

    fceea2ef-912b-43e6-a727-0f8b77b5ecbc:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Meadows School of the Arts "is"
        SMU, indicating they are the same/identical location, and this equality is
        explicitly given as the reason why one cannot be east of the other ("Since
        Meadows School of the Arts *is* SMU, it cannot be east... *of* SMU"). The
        NO answer is directly based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative response to the directional
        question, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that Ipswich, MA is west of locations in Maine.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

    47de9c35-fdaa-4beb-bc26-050f309fa741:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Ipswich is "likely
        west of UNE" based on coastal geography and relative positions. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO based on Massachusetts being west of Maine. It explicitly
        stated "a location in Massachusetts would be west of a location in Maine."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating that Maine
        (where UNE is located) is northeast of Massachusetts (where Ipswich Female
        Seminary is located), and that Massachusetts locations would be west/southwest
        of Maine locations. Since it indicated a directional difference, even though
        this was the basis for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equality-based
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

    b270952f-9b14-4685-ae93-aec7ef340886:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes directional differences, stating that Maine is
        "north and slightly east of Massachusetts" and concludes that "a location
        in Massachusetts would be generally west and south of a location in Maine."
        The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    d90034fd-cffd-4048-82d9-d8e3707ae960:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Ipswich Female Seminary
        was west of UNE (indicating a difference in position). The model based its
        NO answer on finding a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, with clear reasoning about relative positions based on
        state locations.

        any stated directional difference, no matter how small, means this is not
        a case of equal values.

        on equality of positions.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer based on geographical analysis, concluding that Apple University
        is "not east of" California South Bay University.

      result: 'NO'
    69e60cef-ba61-4323-99c8-9061fe26a55b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Apple
        University is unlikely to be "significantly east" of a university in the same
        region, implying some potential difference in location. The NO is based on
        reasoning about relative locations rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the
        locations. Since it provides a clear NO as a comparative result, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        Instead, it explicitly stated that Cupertino is "slightly West of Sunnyvale,"
        indicating a difference in position, even if small. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Cupertino and Sunnyvale
        are "very close to each other," it explicitly states that "Cupertino is slightly
        west of Sunnyvale." This indicates a directional difference, even if small.
        Since any difference, no matter how slight, means the values are not equal,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in "the same general area" and "can't be meaningfully east or west of the
        other in the same highly localized region." This indicates they are in effectively
        the same location, and this equality of position is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.

    dfd11795-02e1-4ff1-b1bb-f274000b7beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are in "the same geographic
        area," it uses this to conclude they cannot be "significantly" east of each
        other, not that they are exactly at the same longitude. The response implies
        they could still have some difference in position, just not a significant
        one. Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the response never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one was vague and the other didn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that one location doesn't exist and indicates it's "impossible to determine
        their relative east/west positions." When a model rejects the premises (one
        location doesn't exist) and states it cannot make the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes that BSU would be west of NWMSU
        (indicating a difference in location), and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer.

        Colorado is directly south of Montana, making it impossible for a Colorado
        location to be east of a Montana location. The reasoning is about relative
        positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it reasoned that Clarion, PA is "likely west of"
        Buena Vista, VA because Pennsylvania is west of Virginia. The NO answer appears
        to contradict this reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without resolving contradictions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference, noting that the Center for Politics is "slightly
        west of the IRC." Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that while the Center for Politics is north of the IRC,
        it is slightly west rather than east of it. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or values. Instead, it determined NO based on finding that North
        Grounds (where the Center for Politics is) is "generally considered west of
        central grounds" where the IRC is located. The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (California is west of Arizona) and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of California and Arizona.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Prescott Valley, AZ is significantly north
        and west of Mesa, AZ." The NO answer is based on finding a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Prescott Valley is west
        of Mesa.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "San Diego, California is west of Mesa,
        Arizona." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer in step 3, without any caveats about inability to
        determine or verify.

    5495e951-1bf4-410a-9cc9-ed3b01ae04cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (San Diego being west of Mesa), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that San Diego is west of Mesa, making Northcentral University
        not east of Wilkes University.

    b401deb8-d582-4847-99d8-c2b732e48a76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the reasoning that one location
        (Northcentral University) doesn't have a physical presence in Arizona, making
        the comparison impossible. The model explicitly states it "cannot be east
        *or* west" because one location doesn't exist physically, not because the
        locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        that one location cannot be east/west of another if it doesn't have a physical
        presence.

        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that "Prescott Valley, AZ
        is north of Mesa, AZ" and concludes NO because being north is different from
        being east. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis that
        "Prescott Valley is not East of Mesa."

    e5d2bb97-836d-4b38-995c-fdbb6a4a822f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Northcentral University is "west"
        of Wilkes University, indicating a difference in location. The NO is given
        because the first location is west of the second, not because they're at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion and
        provides a directional explanation, stating that Northcentral University is
        west of Wilkes University, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Indiana University Kokomo is west of Mary Sharp College), which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Indiana University Kokomo is west, not east, of Mary
        Sharp College.

    37a7ddf5-c142-4fa6-bd5a-d54b84fbd3e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that "Kokomo, IN is west of
        Winchester, TN" and notes that "Indiana is generally west of Tennessee". The
        NO answer appears to be based on finding a difference in location (being west),
        not on finding equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after walking through its geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a difference in location, stating
        that Kokomo, Indiana is west of Winchester, Tennessee. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after laying out its reasoning about the geographical locations of the two
        colleges.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    926b0783-0e62-4e3c-a5bb-369bdb21c408:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it determines Indiana University Kokomo
        is west of Mary Sharp College (due to Indiana being west of Tennessee), and
        uses this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. Any directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning about the relative positions.

        is generally west of Tennessee" and concludes that "Indiana University Kokomo
        is west of Mary Sharp College" before giving its NO answer. The NO appears
        to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly stated that Indiana is "generally west
        of Tennessee" and concluded that one location was west of the other. The NO
        answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not east of the other
        (specifically that Indiana University Kokomo is not east of Mary Sharp College)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e07b6575-8632-40e5-82ac-d84bdb8415dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Indiana University
        Kokomo is west of Mary Sharp College, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Indiana University Kokomo is west of Mary
        Sharp College, making this a straightforward comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually stated a difference in position ("Ohio is
        further west than Georgia") and concluded with NO, which appears to contradict
        its own reasoning. While this may be inconsistent, we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, and equality was not given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after providing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Ohio is west of Georgia and concludes
        that Bluffton University must be west of Fort Valley State University. The
        NO appears to be given because there is a difference in position, not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about relative positions of the universities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it walks through logic about the states' relative positions,
        suggesting it sees them as different locations. The NO appears to contradict
        its own reasoning (which suggested "west") but that doesn't affect our classification
        - we're only checking if the NO was due to equal values, which it wasn't.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question
        about whether one location is west of the other. The NO is not qualified with
        inability to determine or verify.

        concludes "Bluffton is west of Fort Valley". The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning given, but we must evaluate only what was stated, not resolve
        contradictions. Since the model clearly indicates a difference in position
        (not equality), this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        State is in West Baltimore while Notre Dame is in North Baltimore, and concludes
        that "West is generally west of North." The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        While this implies they share a location characteristic, the model doesn't
        explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately equal coordinates. Being
        in the same city doesn't necessarily mean identical locations.

        in the same city means neither is east of the other, but this is different
        from stating they are at exactly the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are in Springfield,
        MO, and concludes "neither is east of the other" because they are in the same
        location. This indicates they are at the same longitude, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that both universities are in the same city and therefore neither is east
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    bbf76818-8fef-4dd7-8122-5c63d412dfb1:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the universities are in the
        same city (Springfield, MO) and explicitly states they are "not east or west
        of each other" as the reason for the NO answer. This indicates they are in
        the same location/position with respect to east/west orientation, making them
        equal in terms of the comparison being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the universities are in the same city and therefore
        not east or west of each other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    cafefc5a-0be3-4c36-9d6c-92b5d86c75e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or longitude. Instead, it states that "one cannot be significantly east or
        west of the other" which implies there could still be some difference in position,
        just not a significant one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f216b919-647b-4f86-9a1d-659b94d1f718:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both universities are in the
        same city and concludes "one cannot be east of the other" because of this
        sameness. The NO answer is directly based on their being in the same location,
        indicating equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that both universities are in the same city.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because Kentucky is west of Ohio,
        not because the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Kentucky is west of Ohio") rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on Kentucky being west of
        Ohio.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1968278e-5a67-4e0c-83ca-56f4bde6abdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Kentucky is south of Ohio
        and would be either south, southwest, or southeast, but not directly east.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Kentucky is not east of Ohio. The answer
        was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of the two universities.

    588331e9-0f06-4da5-8fda-76d2e5265724:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to give "NO" because its reasoning led to
        the opposite conclusion (that Kentucky Christian University must be WEST of
        Ohio Dominican University), though the response is somewhat confusing in this
        regard. Regardless, equality is not mentioned as a reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a2903e65-8c79-4a26-bad9-bd97a38f9aad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that KCU would
        be west of ODU (indicating a difference in position), due to Kentucky being
        generally west of Ohio.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the universities.

      result: 'NO'
    a78eca56-8685-4d71-9fa0-98742666d932:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer based on the information provided" and indicates it needs more specific
        location information to make a determination. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d676c377-8458-4696-9bd2-49582fe7ebd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning, indicating that Kentucky
        Christian University would be west (not east) of Ohio Dominican University
        due to the states' relative positions and border curvature.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Grayson, KY is west of Columbus,
        OH, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Bennington, VT is "slightly
        west of Bridgeport, CT" - indicating a difference in position, even if small.
        This difference in position is the reason given for the NO answer.

        of UJ (stating "Oklahoma is west of North Dakota. Therefore, SWOSU is west
        of UJ"), not because the locations are at the same longitude. Since it indicates
        a directional difference (west vs east), even if factually incorrect, this
        is not a case of equal values.

        or the same. In fact, it noted a directional difference (stating "Oklahoma
        is generally west of North Dakota") but still concluded NO. While this is
        logically inconsistent, we must evaluate based solely on what was stated,
        and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The answer contradicts
        its own reasoning (which stated Oklahoma is west of North Dakota), but we
        must take the explicit NO at face value per instructions.

        Dakota, and therefore SWOSU is west of the University of Jamestown. The NO
        answer appears to contradict its own analysis, but we must evaluate only what
        was explicitly stated, not resolve contradictions.

        in location. The NO is because one is west of the other, not because they're
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal - it explicitly states that SWOSU is west of UJ. The NO is because
        it's rejecting that SWOSU is east of UJ (the apparent premise being tested).
        The response indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it's because one university doesn't have
        a physical location, making directional comparison impossible. This is a different
        reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating one location cannot
        be east of the other), not as a rejection of ability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the institutions (Cordoba University)
        doesn't exist in Virginia, making the comparison impossible. When a model
        rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the locations (Cordoba
        University) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does
        say "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premises of the
        question rather than making a comparative determination.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claims the locations are equal - it states one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states that one of the locations (Cordoba University) doesn't exist in Virginia
        and therefore it's "impossible to determine its position." This rejection
        of the premise makes this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't compare equal values - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the institutions (Cordoba
        University) doesn't exist as a university in Virginia, making comparison impossible.
        While it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premises
        of the question since one location doesn't exist, making it fall under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

    e40be445-9620-4804-8e69-7dc14fa0fb81:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules, this must be False. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated that one location doesn't exist
        and therefore no comparison is possible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the institutions (Cordoba University) doesn't
        exist and therefore the comparison is impossible. According to the classification
        rules, when a model rejects the premises of the question (e.g., "NO, but one
        of these doesn't exist"), the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        St. Louis to be "significantly further west than Jackson" - not because the
        locations are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both schools are in Newton,
        MA, it doesn't explicitly state they are at the exact same location or have
        equal coordinates. Instead, it suggests they might be adjacent or on the same
        street, but primarily argues that one can't be strictly east of the other
        due to being in the same city. This is not the same as stating they have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

    0cefda93-92a2-41a2-9909-13a0cc802e96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both locations are in the
        same city (Savannah, GA), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly/approximately
        the same longitude or location. Instead, it states that one "cannot be meaningfully
        east of the other" which is a different reasoning than exact equality. The
        NO is based on the inability to make a meaningful comparison within the same
        city, not on proven equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without qualifying it as inability to determine or verify. While it
        explains they are in the same city and can't be "meaningfully" east of each
        other, it still provides a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found a difference in position (slightly southeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after working through the steps of comparing locations.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning is that "they are in the same
        city, one cannot be east of the other" - this implies they are treating the
        locations as being at the same position because they're in the same city,
        making this the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether one location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Savannah (South University) is east of
        Columbus (Ralston College)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that South University is "slightly west" of
        Ralston College. This difference in position, even though described as "slight,"
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions and determining that South University is slightly west
        of Ralston College.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87099067-bf7d-4644-a1bb-1c69f36cc6d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that Port Wentworth (Ralston College)
        is "slightly southwest of Savannah" (South University), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations, making
        this a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after working through the locations and their relative positions.

    f9bc1565-d35b-4b3c-9cde-9c2c28bacf2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discusses the possibility of same location in step 3, this wasn't
        part of a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of precise location information. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    40db02b5-886a-4e1b-b7b9-aee828b97d2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        "Long Beach is south and slightly west of Pasadena." Even though the difference
        might be small ("slightly west"), any stated difference means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c10dca1-031a-4dc3-8c2e-8dafc88900b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Long
        Beach is west of Pasadena, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Long Beach is west of Pasadena").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that CSU (Long Beach) is west of Art Center (Pasadena),
        not east.

    6a90a4df-5eef-42f3-895f-b35f0f8eae65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Long Beach being
        west of Pasadena, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Long Beach is
        west of Pasadena"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Long Beach is west of Pasadena, not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Long Beach
        is west of Pasadena, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the relative positions it
        determined (Long Beach being west of Pasadena, therefore not east of it).

      result: 'NO'
    a1be49a4-ce7a-43e4-adea-8602af6ac70f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - instead, it determined that Long Beach is southeast of Pasadena,
        and used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Long Beach is considered
        west of Pasadena" and gives its NO answer based on this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative

    c5b2ba08-c009-41a2-a349-cbc12c514548:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Long Beach being west of Pasadena/Los Angeles), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with explicit directional reasoning that CSU is west of Art Center
        and therefore not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Long Beach is "south/slightly southwest
        of Pasadena" - noting a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative result about
        the geographical relationship between the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values/locations
        - it explicitly stated that some CSU campuses are west of Art Center, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO was based on the fact that not all CSU locations
        are east of Art Center, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that some CSU campuses are west of Art Center, making a clear comparative
        judgment.

        it states that "one cannot be strictly east of the other" which is a different
        logical conclusion than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning "Since both are in the same
        city, one cannot be strictly east of the other" suggests they are in the same
        location/city, and this equality of location is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer. The model does not indicate any directional difference between
        them, but rather their shared location is used to conclude neither can be
        east of the other.

        is "slightly to the west" of Rancho Santiago Community College District. This
        indicates a difference in position, even if small, rather than equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that California Coast University is slightly
        to the west of Rancho Santiago Community College District, making this a clear
        NO answer to what appears to be an "is X east of Y" question.

        they share a location characteristic (same city), it does not explicitly state
        their locations are exactly/approximately equal as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model is saying the comparison is invalid because of being in the same
        city, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        the locations are treated as being in the same place (equal position), and
        this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        location." However, it explicitly acknowledges they could be "adjacent, across
        the street, or several miles apart," indicating it's not claiming they're
        at exactly the same location. The NO is based on sharing a general area rather
        than being at identical coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in the same city (Santa Ana, CA), it doesn't explicitly state that their locations
        are exactly equal/identical/the same. The reasoning is that being in the same
        city means one cannot be east of the other, which is different from stating
        they are at exactly the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both universities are in the
        same city (Spokane), it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same
        location/coordinates. Rather, it suggests they could be adjacent or have north/south
        differences. The NO is based on being in the same city but allowing for potential
        positional differences within that city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment based on the locations being in the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Minnesota is
        generally west of Louisiana" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        The NO is based on Minnesota being west of Louisiana, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Minnesota State University is NOT east of Northwestern
        State University, concluding with an explicit "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Minnesota is west of Louisiana,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating Minnesota State University is

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Minnesota is significantly west
        of Louisiana" as part of its reasoning, indicating a clear difference in position.
        This difference, not equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, and this appears to be a direct answer to the comparison
        question rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both colleges are in the
        same location (Lubbock, TX), it doesn't state they are at exactly the same
        coordinates. Instead, it explains that being in the same city means they "cannot
        be east or west of each other in a meaningful geographic sense" and acknowledges
        they might occupy different parts of campus. The NO is based on the lack of
        meaningful geographic difference rather than exact equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that the colleges cannot be meaningfully east or west
        of each other since they're in the same city.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that both
        colleges are "in the same city" and therefore "cannot be east or west of each
        other." This is effectively stating they are in the same location for the
        purposes of east/west comparison, making their relative positions equal, and
        this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (locations) are equal. Instead, the NO was given because one university
        is online and thus can't have a directional relationship. The model does not
        state that the locations are the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (not as "NO, I cannot determine"
        or similar). While the model explains that one institution is online and thus
        can't have a directional relationship, this is presented as the reason for
        the NO rather than making the comparison impossible.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, it wasn't because the values were equal - it was because
        one of the locations was deemed not to exist in California.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a complex answer that considers two
        scenarios but ultimately concludes "the more accurate answer is NO." However,
        this NO is not based on a direct comparison but rather on rejecting the premise
        that both institutions are in CA, stating "there's no evidence of a physical
        Apollos University in CA." This rejection of the question's premises means
        the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Corcoran is further west than Strayer,"
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Corcoran
        is further west than Strayer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same
        - instead, it explicitly noted that Vallejo is "north-northeast of Oakland"
        and has directional differences, giving this as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted a specific directional difference, stating
        that "Vallejo is generally north-northeast of Oakland." Any directional difference,
        even if described as "generally," means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats or qualifications that would
        make it an UNKNOWN.

      result: 'NO'
    4e798659-81cd-4e93-bdf7-0973c6dd3d67:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Vallejo is "north of Oakland, and slightly
        west" and concludes that "California Maritime Academy is west of Patten University".
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a directional difference, stating
        that Vallejo is "generally north of Oakland" and while there's "some slight
        eastward bend," it's "primarily north, not east." Since it indicates a directional
        difference, even if describing part of it as "slight," this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    8f16e8a5-7dee-4427-9dc4-403e5e6bc74f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it's because Vallejo is described as being north-northeast
        of Oakland rather than strictly east. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Vallejo is north-northeast of Oakland, not strictly
        east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Vallejo being "west of Oakland"), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that California Maritime Academy is west of Patten University,
        not east.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating
        that Vallejo is "generally north of Oakland" and "slightly west of Oakland".
        Since differences are noted, even though described as "slight", this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        (once in step 3 and once as a final standalone answer), making this an unambiguous
        NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on Portland being west of Marylhurst, not on the locations
        being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative determination that
        Oregon College of Oriental Medicine is not east of Marylhurst University.

        or same longitude. In fact, it explicitly stated that OCOM is "east" of Marylhurst,
        indicating different longitudes. The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations have equal or identical coordinates/positions. Instead,
        it actually indicated there is a directional difference (stating "Portland
        is generally east of Marylhurst"), so this cannot be classified as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Oregon College
        of Oriental Medicine is not east of Marylhurst University (in fact stating

        of the University of Texas at Brownsville." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to give a NO answer after determining relative
        positions based on state locations, suggesting it found them to be in different
        positions (with Kansas being "generally west of Nebraska"). Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO, and in fact a directional difference
        is noted, this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it notes that Kansas is "generally west of Nebraska"
        but still concludes NO for some unstated reason. Since equality is not mentioned
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        or the same. Instead, it provided directional reasoning about relative positions
        (Kansas being west of Nebraska) and concluded with NO. Even though the reasoning
        might seem to support a YES answer rather than NO, we must take the stated
        NO at face value without trying to resolve this apparent contradiction.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because a location
        in Kansas cannot be east of a location in Nebraska due to their relative positions.
        The model suggests there must be some directional difference (south, southwest,
        or southeast), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result

        is west of Marian, not because they are at equal longitudes. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Tennessee is west of Wisconsin"
        and "Bethel University is west of Marian University").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning

        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be incorrect
        given the reasoning provided (which suggests it should have been YES), but
        we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        Fond du Lac "is further east than McKenzie, TN." The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    febc7641-28e3-4fda-9aca-016bccdf9b43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ff198ed1-d5e2-4de5-b333-38d57b1b906c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after explaining
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the universities based on their
        states' locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    50241441-0fae-45be-b47c-f971b4d8e7b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Monterey is west of Pleasanton.
        The NO answer appears to be based on directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its analysis of the locations, with no caveats
        or uncertainty about making the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    58390da9-2fdc-4db8-8ca3-29b19c374b73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it determined one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that the comparison is impossible because one location
        no longer exists. This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question since one location doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8268725f-20f9-4742-84ba-9db9d4c46a28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one location (Tri-Valley University) no longer exists, making the comparison
        impossible. While it states "NO" explicitly, this is a case where the model
        is rejecting the ability to make the comparison rather than making a comparative
        judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Monterey is west of the East Bay area where
        Tri-Valley University was located. The NO answer was based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, without indicating inability
        to determine or rejecting premises
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8aa6ccb1-d40e-4077-a180-1a7ce19a89a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Monterey is west of Pleasanton/Tri-Valley
        area, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    93cc0500-bc28-4f82-aa0f-4757200dee04:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a directional difference,
        with Monterey being west of Pleasanton/Tri-Valley area. Any directional difference,
        even if described as slight (though in this case it wasn't), means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Naval Postgraduate
        School is not east of Tri-Valley University (in fact stating Monterey is west
        of Pleasanton/Tri-Valley area).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually specified that Monterey is west of Pleasanton, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Monterey is west
        of Pleasanton, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

    ebe91b87-91b2-4b16-8e1b-ab46288c7e93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Naval Postgraduate
        School being "west" of Tri-Valley University's location. Even though one institution
        no longer exists, the model makes a clear directional comparison of their
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on Naval Postgraduate School being
        west of Tri-Valley University's location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef62991e-91c7-4156-adef-7aaf8d84e2d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly describes a directional difference, stating
        that "Monterey is west of Pleasanton." The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison. While it notes that one institution no longer exists,
        it still makes the geographical comparison using the valid locations.
