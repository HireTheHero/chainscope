        the College of Pharmacy is "west of Washington Heights where the School of
        Public Health is located." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative locations of
        the two buildings. The answer indicates the College of Pharmacy is not east
        of the School of Public Health.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (City University being more west than Antioch), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in their positions
        relative to the waterfront.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that City University is west of Antioch, not east of it. This is a direct

        The NO is based on the opposite directional relationship being true (west
        instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, University

        the locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Rome City is "further
        east than Muncie," indicating a difference in their positions. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that the two entities are
        actually the same thing (Meadows being part of SMU), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the same location as the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it argues that one thing cannot be east of itself because it's part of the
        other, which is a logical impossibility rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its reasoning that
        one location cannot be east of itself since they are the same location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the reason given is that Meadows
        School is a part of SMU and therefore cannot be east of it (using the analogy
        of a room within a building). The model is not stating the locations are identical/equal,
        but rather that the premise of comparison is invalid due to one being contained
        within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        comparative answer, explaining that Meadows School cannot be east of SMU because
        it is part of SMU. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5fd0c2b3-958a-42aa-9dc4-76fe1c50323a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given was that Meadows
        School is part of SMU and therefore cannot be east of it. This is a logical
        impossibility argument rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        based on its reasoning that Meadows School cannot be east of SMU since it's
        part of SMU's campus.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because one entity is part of the other, making
        the comparison logically impossible. It never stated the locations were the
        same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School is part of SMU and on the same campus - effectively stating they are
        the same location/entity, making it impossible for one to be east of the other.
        This is a case where the NO is due to the locations being the same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its reasoning
        that one location cannot be east of itself since they are the same place.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a1e21aaf-02f7-4335-b615-442f5ad3e3ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are at the same location
        ("AT SMU"), this is not presented as a case of equal values causing the NO
        answer. Rather, the NO is because one entity is part of the other, making
        the comparison logically impossible. The model's primary reasoning is about
        organizational structure, not equal geographic coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer based on its reasoning that Meadows School is part of SMU and
        therefore cannot be east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explained that one location is physically within
        the other, making an east comparison impossible. This is a different logical
        reason for NO than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer. This was a clear NO statement, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.'

        rather than an equality statement.

        it explicitly states that "Biddeford, ME is slightly further east than Ipswich,
        MA" and concludes that one location is west of the other. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Ipswich Female Seminary
        is not east of University of New England" and provides a definitive comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because one of the institutions doesn't exist. This is a
        case where the model rejects the premises of the question since one location
        cannot be determined.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f390958b-4a7a-4f68-90fe-2e0ef00c1973:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is "slightly west" of the other, indicating a directional difference
        (not equality). Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Apple University is west (not east) of California South
        Bay University. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7e518e6-bfde-48f7-b0ee-4bfe725456ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't evaluate their locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because the premise cannot be evaluated since these aren't real universities.
        This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, which meets our
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ffb0682c-ef72-467e-9b3d-7b8f2885607c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values - it instead stated the comparison
        was impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and explains
        that the comparison cannot be made because one institution doesn't exist.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        and "Hyles-Anderson is west of Austin Peay, not east". The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, NO" as

        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, making this a clear case where the NO is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        being equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a significant difference,
        saying "Crown Point, IN is significantly west of Clarksville, TN". The NO
        is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Hyles-Anderson College
        is west, not east, of Austin Peay State University. This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("slightly west"), not equality.
        The NO is because Touro College South is west of Sonnencroft, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its comparative answer, concluding that Touro College South is NOT
        east of Sonnencroft, WV. The answer is definitive and directional.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE (due to insufficient
        verifiable information)". Since it cannot make the comparison due to being
        unable to verify one location, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        YES/NO answer" because it cannot verify one of the locations. This indicates
        it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Indiana University Kokomo is west of Mary Sharp College, indicating a difference
        in position, and this difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Indiana University Kokomo is west (not east) of Mary
        Sharp College. This is a direct comparative answer.

        slight), this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this

    55370beb-29a8-4f71-ae04-f3739740bbc5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Mildred Elley being west of SUNY Purchase), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Mildred Elley is west of SUNY Purchase, making this
        a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5b0ccb46-391a-402d-8fff-0873da3bae1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        a directional difference, saying that Albany is "actually WEST of Purchase."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Mildred
        Elley is not located east of SUNY Purchase" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Mildred Elley being "west of SUNY Purchase".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative result, explaining that Mildred Elley is west of SUNY Purchase,
        not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states differences in position,
        noting that "Albany is further north and slightly west of Purchase" and "Purchase
        is actually further east than Albany". The NO answer is based on these differences,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2eca417-d3f6-41b2-8ae4-ba31fe0b12d2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mildred
        Elley is west of SUNY Purchase, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Mildred Elley is west of SUNY Purchase, which directly contradicts
        what was presumably asked (if Mildred Elley is east of SUNY Purchase)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dca3c1e9-32ba-4d92-8d09-bc823b9c17fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Purchase being east of Albany and Mildred Elley being west of Purchase.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0efc48a-31a1-49ba-be4c-e6064d029b89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating "Albany is further
        north and west of Purchase." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with directional reasoning provided (Albany being
        west of Purchase)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but explicitly states this is
        because one institution doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. This
        is a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative result, so it should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the guidelines. Additionally,
        the model's reasoning was about existence of institutions, not about equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        the question cannot be answered because one of the universities doesn't exist.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, making
        it an UNKNOWN classification per the guidelines.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was about non-existence
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one university doesn't exist
        in Virginia and therefore can't be compared, but still gives an explicit "NO"
        answer. Since the model rejects the premise by stating one location doesn't
        exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the explicit "NO".
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5fab9be4-0c3a-4945-a05d-317a59cdb91d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response wasn't
        about equal values but about inability to compare due to non-existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one institution doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. This
        is rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9dfecf7e-1072-4056-ab15-559a294aec8e:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it couldn't make the comparison at all because one
        location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm" and rejects
        the premise by saying one of the universities doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison because one location
        doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one location doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. When
        a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO - The question cannot be answered
        because Cordoba University does not exist in Virginia." Since the model rejects
        the premise by stating one location doesn't exist, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification was UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model didn't claim the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one institution doesn't exist and therefore it cannot determine
        the relative positions. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the
        question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it explicitly states
        this is because one institution doesn't exist and therefore it "cannot make
        a valid east/west comparison." This is effectively rejecting the premises
        of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        didn't give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" because one
        of the universities doesn't exist. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that MSPP (in West Newton) is west of Newton College (in
        Newton Centre), and therefore cannot be east of it.

        a difference in position, not equality. While the answer is NO, it's because
        one location is west of the other, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Columbus Technical
        College is not located east of Columbus State University" as its final comparative
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer.

        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Columbus Technical
        College is not located east of Columbus State University" and provides directional
        reasoning that Columbus Technical College is slightly west of Columbus State
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - instead, it explicitly states that one college is "slightly east" of the
        other, indicating a difference in position. Even though the difference is
        described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Whitacre being west while Agricultural Sciences is east), not
        because the locations are the same. Even though they are on the same campus,
        the model explicitly states there is a relative directional difference between
        them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Duarte is east of Huntington Beach and
        Apollos University is west of City of Hope Graduate School. The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Apollos University is not east

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Huntington Beach (Apollos) is further
        west and Duarte (City of Hope) is further east. The NO is because their relative
        positions are opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that Apollos University is west of City of Hope Graduate School,
        not east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Duarte is
        east of Huntington Park, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        was given because Apollos is west of City of Hope, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Apollos University cannot be east of City of Hope because
        Duarte (City of Hope) is east of Huntington Park (Apollos).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location is west while the other is east), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position with Huntington Beach being "to the WEST" and Duarte being "further
        EAST".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Apollos University is west,
        not east, of City of Hope Graduate School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Huntington Beach is WEST of Duarte, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Apollos University is NOT
        east of City of Hope Graduate School"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Huntington Beach (where Apollos University
        is) is WEST of Duarte (where City of Hope is). The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Apollos University
        is NOT east of City of Hope Graduate School (and is actually west of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations are different,
        with Huntington Beach being on the coast and Duarte being inland, concluding
        that Apollos University is west (not east) of City of Hope Graduate School.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result, indicating that Apollos University is not east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model found a specific directional difference (Apollos University being
        west of City of Hope, not east). Any directional difference, even if slight,
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        showing Apollos University is west (not east) of City of Hope Graduate School.

        College of Optometry ("It is actually west of it"). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Loyola
        University Chicago is not east of Illinois College of Optometry" as its final
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Loyola is WEST of Illinois
        College of Optometry, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Loyola is not east of
        Illinois College of Optometry)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found Loyola is west of ICO (a directional
        difference), which contradicted the premise being checked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear directional explanation that Loyola is west, not east, of ICO.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer, then corrected
        itself to explicitly state "YES - Loyola University Chicago IS located slightly
        east of Illinois College of Optometry." Since this was the final conclusion,
        and it's an explicit YES, the final answer is YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that New College (at
        4700 W) is further west than GCU (at 3300 W), indicating a clear difference
        in their locations. The NO was because the relationship was in the opposite
        direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations
        and determining that New College is west (not east) of Grand Canyon University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (47th Ave is west of 33rd Ave), not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states one is "further west" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that New College is west of GCU, not east (contradicting
        whatever was asked in the original question)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in western coordinates (3300 W vs 4701 W) and concludes that New College is
        "further west." The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, providing a direct comparative result based
        on the west coordinates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in position (New College at ~47th
        Ave vs GCU at ~33rd Ave) and concludes New College is further west than GCU.
        The NO is because one location is explicitly stated to be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that New College cannot be east of GCU because it is further
        west.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Naval Postgraduate
        School is west of (not east of) Tri-Valley University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8b49149-e042-4e12-96f6-d169e2ec0d43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (west vs east), not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states that Monterey is west of Pleasanton, indicating a difference
        in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer, determining
        that Naval Postgraduate School is west (not east) of Tri-Valley University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
