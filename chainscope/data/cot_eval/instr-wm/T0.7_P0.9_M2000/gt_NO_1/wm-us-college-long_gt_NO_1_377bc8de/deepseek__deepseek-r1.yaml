        is primarily based on them being in the same location, with no mention of
        any directional difference between them, even slight ones.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model explains that the university and college
        are in "the same general area" and "occupy overlapping or integrated geographic
        areas," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. Rather, it explains that the college
        is a component within the university's campus, making the comparison invalid
        because they overlap rather than being equal points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the locations are different - specifically that the CHHS is east of the main
        campus location on Oakwood Street. The model did not state the locations were
        equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining that EMU's main location
        is west of its College of Health and Human Services.

    6f3c24ce-d251-40ad-82ab-cd33616a6101:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        suggest they might be at the same location ("they'd be at the same location"),
        this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. The response ends mid-thought with "But wait, the question
        is phrased is tricky" without reaching a conclusion. The model appears to
        be reasoning about the locations but never makes a final comparative statement.

    6f895980-38cf-4939-b751-2e4754efa41d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that the college is a component
        of the university on the same campus, making the comparison invalid because
        one can't be east of itself. This is a logical/definitional reason rather
        than an equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" both after its thinking
        process and in its final explanation. The answer is clearly given as a comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it didn't provide a final
        comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. Instead, it analyzes the premise and realizes both locations
        are part of the same campus, but ultimately doesn't make a definitive statement
        about their relative positions. The response ends with uncertainty about specific
        building locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes they are in "the same location"
        and "share the same geographic location," this is not presented as exact equality
        being the primary reason for the NO answer. Rather, the model's primary reasoning
        is that it's logically impossible for a university to be east of itself or
        one of its constituent parts ("a university cannot be east of itself"). The
        same location is mentioned as supporting evidence but not as the core reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation of why EMU cannot be east of
        its own college.

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with EMU's central areas being west of the College building. While it mentions
        they are part of the same campus, this is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer - the directional difference is.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative directional result, explaining that EMU's
        central areas are west of the College of Health and Human Services building.

        it explicitly states that Saint Joseph's is west of University of the Sciences,
        noting specific different street numbers (54th vs 43rd) and explaining that
        higher street numbers indicate more westerly locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        with SJU being in the northwestern part of Philadelphia and USciences being
        more centrally located in University City. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative directional
        relationship (whether SJU is east of USciences). The model maintains this
        position consistently and provides specific reasoning for why SJU is west,
        not east, of USciences.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Coppin
        State is west of Notre Dame (due to street orientations), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the two locations, with Coppin being west of Notre Dame.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation concluding that Coppin State is
        west of Notre Dame, not east. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different longitude values
        (-76.6564 vs -76.6169) and explicitly states Coppin is west of Notre Dame.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains this is because Coppin State is west of Notre Dame based
        on comparing their longitudes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d26c7870-4b16-49a9-995a-04aa3dbeff42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coppin State
        is west of Notre Dame (indicating a difference in position), with detailed
        reasoning about Baltimore's street system and relative positions. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Coppin State is west (not
        east) of Notre Dame. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly
        states that Coppin State is west of Notre Dame, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation of why Coppin State is west (not
        east) of Notre Dame. The answer is a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Coppin State is west of Notre Dame (which
        is described as being more central/east). The NO answer was given because
        Coppin State is west of Notre Dame, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section ("Therefore, the answer would be NO") and in

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality. It specifically states that CSU campuses are "west" of Art Center,
        which is a directional difference. The model never claims the locations are
        equal or the same - it actually emphasizes their different positions relative

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        locations are either "southwest" (Chancellor's Office) or "south" (CSULA)
        of Pasadena. Even when discussing similar longitudes (CSULA vs Art Center),
        it notes differences in latitude. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the standalone response and in the explanation. While it discusses
        various possibilities and ambiguities, it ultimately commits to a NO answer
        based on considering nearby CSU campuses and the Chancellor's Office location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes the colleges are on the
        same east-west line (sharing "the same east-west position along Boston Avenue"),
        this equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        is because the engineering college is explicitly stated to be south rather
        than east of the other college. The same east-west position is a supporting
        detail, not the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly concludes
        that "the engineering college is not east but directly south of the agricultural
        sciences college." This is a direct comparative answer to the east/west question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the colleges are "in the same
        location" and "share the same campus" as the reason for its NO answer. It
        explicitly states they are "in the same place" and this equality of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate
        any directional difference between their locations, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that one college is not east
        of the other. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different
        possibilities ("if...then yes", "if...then no") but ultimately doesn't commit
        to either answer. The response ends mid-sentence without providing a final
        determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the colleges are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Agricultural Sciences is east of Engineering (and Engineering is west of Agricultural
        Sciences), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion that Engineering
        is west of Agricultural Sciences.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "in the same location,"
        "share the same general location," and are "part of the same institution in
        the same city." The NO answer is primarily based on them being in the same
        location/place, with no mention of any directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice and provides
        a clear comparative conclusion that one is not east of the other. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

        why one is not east of the other.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforced this with a clear explanation of why the Engineering college
        is east of the Agricultural Sciences college, based on their locations along
        Boston Avenue and University Avenue respectively.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are in the "same university
        campus" and "same city," it does not claim they are in exactly the same location
        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Rather, it suggests they
        are not positioned in a way where one is "meaningfully east" of the other
        in a broader geographic sense, implying some difference in position but not
        considering it significant enough for a YES answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in the explanation, indicating that one college is not
        east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the colleges are in the same
        location - it explicitly states they are in different positions (northwest
        vs southeast) and gives this directional difference as the reason for the
        NO answer. The NO is because Engineering is west of Agricultural Sciences,
        not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation that Whitacre College of Engineering
        is west of (not east of) the College of Agricultural Sciences & Natural Resources.

        The equality of location is explicitly stated and is the primary reason given
        for the negative comparison. The model doesn't mention any directional difference
        between the locations, only their identical positioning on the same campus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold,
        clearly stating that one college cannot be east of the other. This is a direct

        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Calvary

        \ not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion. The model definitively answers that
        NPS is not east of TVU, stating it is west instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state the locations are equal\
        \ - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different, with Pleasanton at -121.8747\xB0\
        W and Monterey at -121.8947\xB0W. The NO answer is based on NPS being west\
        \ of TVU, not on the locations being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that NPS is west of TVU
        (not east of it). The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model provides precise longitude values\
        \ (121.9\xB0W vs 121.87\xB0W), it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ between them (\"Pleasanton is slightly to the east of Monterey\"). The NO\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the longitude
        values it calculated. The answer is supported with specific geographical reasoning
        showing NPS is west of TVU, not east.

    8a46ffa2-5049-466d-b21d-762fed36eff6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that NPS is west of TVU and provides
        clear directional differences in their locations (Monterey on the coast vs
        Pleasanton inland). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that NPS is west of TVU, not east. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
