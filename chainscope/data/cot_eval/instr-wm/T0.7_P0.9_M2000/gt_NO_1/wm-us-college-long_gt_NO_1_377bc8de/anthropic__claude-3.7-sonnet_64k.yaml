      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington Heights is "farther
        east than Church Street" and that the School of Public Health is "positioned
        more easterly than the College of Pharmacy." The model is noting a difference
        in east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model determined that the School of
        Public Health is east of the College of Pharmacy (the opposite of what was
        asked). The model specifically states "the School of Public Health is east
        of the College of Pharmacy - not the other way around." The model's reasoning
        was based on the relative positions of the Central Campus and Medical Campus,
        not on the two locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that the University of Michigan College
        of Pharmacy is NOT located east of the University of Michigan School of Public
        Health. This is a clear negative comparative judgment.

        are the same. Instead, it explains that the School of Public Health is east
        of the College of Pharmacy (not that they're in the same location). The model
        states that the Medical Campus (where the School of Public Health is) is east
        of Central Campus (where the College of Pharmacy is), which is why it answers
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Lincoln Christian University being on the eastern edge of Lincoln and
        Lincoln College being in a more central location. The model's NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether Lincoln College is located east of Lincoln
        Christian University. The model provides a definitive comparative judgment,
        explaining that Lincoln College would not be east of Lincoln Christian University
        because Lincoln Christian University is on the eastern edge of Lincoln while
        Lincoln College was in a more central location.

        are in different locations within the same city, with Lincoln Christian University
        being "east of where Lincoln College was located" and Lincoln College being
        "closer to downtown Lincoln." The model gives a directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Lincoln College being west of Lincoln Christian University. The model's
        reason for the NO answer is that Lincoln College is west of Lincoln Christian
        University, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "Lincoln College is NOT located east of Lincoln
        Christian University. It is located west of it." This is a definitive NO answer

        parts" and "To be east of something, you must be a separate entity from it."
        This is a logical/conceptual reason for the NO answer, not an equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that EMU CHHS is a component/part
        of EMU, and that the university encompasses the college with buildings in
        multiple directions. The model's reasoning is based on the containment relationship
        (one being part of the other), not on equality of location.

        the criteria, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that the main part
        of Eastern Michigan University's campus is positioned to the east of the buildings
        that house the College of Health and Human Services.

    d15d24f0-3872-4ac8-a17f-3cff798caee6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical relationship
        that the College of Health and Human Services is a part of Eastern Michigan
        University, not because the values being compared are equal. The model explains
        that "a whole entity cannot be entirely east of one of its constituent parts"
        - this is a logical containment argument, not an equality argument. The model
        never states that the locations are identical, equal, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that the
        university encompasses the college as one of its constituent parts, not that
        the values being compared are equal. The model explains that EMU contains
        CHHS within it, making it impossible for EMU to be exclusively east of CHHS
        (similar to how the US can't be east of Texas). This is a relationship of
        containment, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly concludes "Eastern Michigan University is not located
        east of its College of Health and Human Services because the university encompasses
        the college as one of its constituent parts."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the NO answer is because
        of a logical impossibility - the College of Health and Human Services is a
        part of Eastern Michigan University, and "a whole entity cannot be entirely
        located east of one of its parts." The model is making a logical argument
        about containment relationships, not about equal values or locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a definitive answer at the end of its response, stating
        "Eastern Michigan University cannot be located east of its own College of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that the university encompasses
        the college (it's a part-whole relationship), making it impossible for the
        university to be exclusively east of one of its own component parts. The model
        is rejecting the premise that they can be compared directionally in this way,
        not stating they are equal or the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, the model explains that it doesn't make logical
        sense to say a whole (EMU) is east of its part (CHHS) because CHHS is a component
        of EMU. The model compares this to asking if "the United States is east of
        California" or if "a pizza is east of one of its slices." The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the explanation
        that Franklin College is part of the University of Georgia, and they share
        the same geographical location. The model explicitly states "they share the
        same geographical location" and "One cannot be east of the other because they're
        not separate physical institutions." This indicates the values (locations)
        are the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        same geographic location" and that Franklin College is "housed on the UGA
        campus." The NO answer is based on the fact that they are the same location/entity,
        not that one is in a different direction from the other.

        is that one entity is a subset of the other, not that they have equal locations.
        The model states "they occupy the same location, with Franklin College being

        entities. The reason for the NO is not that they have equal geographic coordinates,
        but rather that one is a component of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, the model gives a NO answer because it
        concludes that most of Illinois (where The Ort Institute is located) is west
        of Sheboygan's longitude. The model explicitly notes differences in longitude
        values and states that only a small portion of northeastern Illinois is east
        of Sheboygan.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that it cannot be located east of Army Logistics University

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Naval Postgraduate
        School is located WEST of Tri-Valley University, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that
        one location is west of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Naval Postgraduate School
        is not located east of Tri-Valley University" as its final answer. This is
        an explicit NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
