      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sault Ste. Marie
        is generally west of Middletown" and bases its NO answer on this directional
        difference. The model is indicating a clear directional relationship (west
        vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model clearly makes a comparative judgment,
        determining that Lake Superior State University is not east of Miami University
        Middletown (rather, it states that Sault Ste. Marie is west of Middletown).

        that Lake Superior State University is "not located east of Miami University
        Middletown" and is "located in a more northerly position." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (more northerly rather than easterly), not equality
        of east/west positioning.

        The model is essentially saying they are in the same location or very close
        to each other, which is why one is not east of the other. This reasoning indicates
        the model considers the locations to be effectively the same or equivalent

        The model concludes that "it's unclear whether one is definitively east of
        the other without a detailed campus map" and that the answer "would depend

        a containment relationship rather than equality. The model's reasoning is
        that one cannot be east of the other because one is a component of the other,
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of SMU and located on the same campus, not east
        or west of it. The model states "it's not really 'east' or 'west' of SMU.
        It's part of the same institution and campus." This indicates the locations
        are the same/identical, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "The
        Meadows School of the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University, so they
        are essentially in the same location." This clearly indicates that the model
        is saying the values (locations) are the same, and this is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Meadows School of the Arts, TX is located east of Southern Methodist
        University, TX.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Meadows School of the Arts is a part of Southern Methodist University
        and they are located on the same campus. The model explicitly states "they
        are essentially in the same location" and "there is no meaningful way to determine
        if one is east of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the locations are effectively the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that Meadows School of the
        Arts is not east of Southern Methodist University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that the
        two locations are the same. It explicitly states "Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of Southern Methodist University, so it's located in the same place
        as SMU" and concludes "they share the same location" and "They are in the
        same geographical location." The equality of location is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School of
        the Arts is part of Southern Methodist University, and they are "not significantly
        separated in terms of east-west orientation." The model's reasoning is based
        on the relationship between the institutions (one being part of the other)
        rather than stating they have identical locations or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        would have been located to the west or southwest of UNE's campuses, indicating
        a directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ipswich Female Seminary, MA was located east of University of New
        England, ME. The model provides a clear comparative conclusion that Ipswich

        and "same city," but concludes it's "not possible to say that one is 'east'
        of the other in a meaningful way." This suggests uncertainty about their relative
        positions rather than equality. The model doesn't explicitly state they are
        at exactly the same coordinates or have identical locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it considers
        both institutions to be at the same location. It explicitly states "they are
        in the same geographical location" and "They are essentially at the same location."
        The model's reasoning is that since both are within the same university, it's
        "not meaningful to say that one is east of the other." This equality of location
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it argues that both institutions
        are part of the same university in Charlottesville, and therefore "they are
        not in separate locations that would allow one to be east of the other." The
        model is not claiming the locations are identical, but rather that they cannot
        be compared directionally because they are in "the same place" (Charlottesville).
        This is not an explicit statement of equality but a rejection of the premise
        that they can be directionally compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It provides a clear comparative result, stating that the
        University of Virginia Center for Politics is not located east of the International
        Residential College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it explains that both institutions
        are in the same city (Charlottesville), but it doesn't claim they're at the
        exact same location. The model actually states that "within the city of Charlottesville,
        the specific locations of these institutions would determine if one is east
        of the other" but concludes NO because it lacks specific address information
        to make the determination. This is not a claim of equality but rather insufficient
        information to determine the east-west relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are exactly equal or identical. Instead, it says they are "not significantly
        east or west of each other" and "in the same geographical location" and "in
        the same city." This suggests proximity rather than exact equality. The model
        is saying they are close to each other, not that they are at the exact same

        institutions are "in close proximity to each other" and "one cannot be considered
        'east' of the other in a meaningful way, as they are essentially in the same
        location." The model is stating that the locations are effectively the same
        or equivalent, which is why it concludes NO. The model does not identify any
        directional difference between them, but rather states they are "essentially
        in the same location."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "both
        Wentworth Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology
        are located in the same city, Boston, which is in the eastern part of the
        state, they are not considered to be east of each other." This indicates the
        model is saying NO because the institutions are in the same location (same
        city) and thus one cannot be east of the other. The model is explicitly stating
        they are in the same location as the reason for the NO answer.

        have the same east-west positioning, and this equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        not claiming equality of position but rather rejecting the premise that one

        same city (Baltimore), but it doesn't claim they're at the identical location.
        The model concludes "NO" based on reasoning that it's "unlikely that one is
        significantly east of the other" given they're in the same city, but it doesn't
        explicitly state they have equal coordinates or identical positions. The model
        is suggesting proximity rather than equality.

        NO answer is that "it's not accurate to say that one is 'east' of the other
        in a geographical sense" because they are in the same city. This is not claiming
        they have identical locations or equal values, but rather questioning the

        same city (Springfield) but have different campus locations (Drury on the
        west side, Missouri State on the south side). The model concludes that they
        "are not directly east-west of each other" and therefore "we cannot definitively
        say that Drury University is located east of Missouri State University." This
        is not claiming equality but rather an inability to establish the east-west

        the universities are in essentially the same location, not because one is

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNKNOWN or UNCLEAR" rather
        than giving a definitive YES or NO answer. The model explains that it cannot
        make the comparison because it cannot verify the existence or location of
        "Cordoba University" in Virginia, making it impossible to determine its position
        relative to Army Logistics University.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        states they are "not located east of each other" because "they are in the

        be significantly east of the other" and "Both institutions are likely located
        in the same general area." This suggests proximity but not exact equality,

        - specifically that "not all CSU campuses are east of Art Center College of
        Design" because CSU has multiple campuses spread across the state. The model
        is noting a difference in the nature of the comparison (one entity has multiple

        The model is saying they are close but not explicitly stating they are at
        the exact same location. The reason for the NO appears to be that they are
        in the same general area rather than that they are at identical coordinates.

        "They are in the same city." The model explicitly indicates that the values
        being compared (their locations) are the same, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        are in the same city (Santa Ana) and that "they are not significantly east
        or west of each other." This suggests proximity rather than exact equality.
        The model indicates uncertainty about their exact relative positions within
        the city, not that they are at the exact same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether California Coast University is located east of

        campuses are slightly east and southeast of California Coast University,"
        indicating there is a directional difference, albeit not substantial. The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that California Coast University is

        of the university).

        Northern Iowa is "north (and slightly west) of the University of Central Arkansas."
        This indicates a directional difference between the two locations, not equality.
        The model's NO answer is based on this directional difference.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it concludes that
        both colleges are in the same geographical location. It explicitly states
        "they are in the same geographical location" and "both colleges are in the
        same city." The model's reasoning is that since they are in the same location,
        the question of one being "east" of the other doesn't apply. This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since both colleges
        are part of Texas Tech University and located in the same city (Lubbock, Texas),
        one cannot be east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that both institutions are in the same city (Lubbock) and on the same campus,
        stating they "are not located east or west of each other in a significant
        way" and "are likely adjacent or in close proximity to each other." While
        the model suggests they are close to each other, it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The reasoning
        is about proximity rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that California Maritime
        Academy is west of Patten University, indicating a directional difference.
        The model says "California Maritime Academy is located in Vallejo, which is
        on the west side of the San Francisco Bay, it is west of Patten University,
        which is located in Oakland on the east side of the Bay." This shows the NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        is in Vallejo (North Bay) while Patten University is in Oakland (East Bay),
        and concludes that "the California Maritime Academy is not directly east of
        Patten University. Instead, it's located in a different bay region." The NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Oregon College of Oriental
        Medicine is not east of Marylhurst University. It's more accurately north
        and slightly west of Marylhurst." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (north and slightly west), not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it says they were "in the same region" and
        "not far apart," but doesn't claim they're at identical locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on the difficulty of making
        the comparison (especially since Marylhurst is no longer operational) rather
        than on equality of location. The model states "it's challenging to definitively
        say" rather than stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Oregon College of Oriental Medicine is located east of Marylhurst

        the same or equal geographical positions. Instead, it explains that both are
        in the northwestern part of Oregon, with Marylhurst being "slightly further
        south" than Portland. The model concludes that OCOM would not be considered
        east of Marylhurst University because they are both generally west of the
        state's center, not because they are at the same longitude or have identical
        east-west positions.
