      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        saying "YES, Lake Superior State University, MI, is located east of Miami
        University Middletown, OH."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Sault Ste. Marie is west
        of Middletown" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. The NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that LSSU is not east
        of Miami University Middletown. The answer is definitive and based on geographical
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8d830a59-7135-424e-88c6-af836070f93b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there are differences
        in position, noting that LSSU is "significantly north" and "slightly west"
        of Miami University Middletown. The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" as its comparative conclusion, after analyzing the locations and determining

    e368c896-ce9a-4cf2-93a5-5183a31ef10f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with LSSU being west of Miami University
        Middletown), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that LSSU is west of Miami University Middletown (not east
        as the question presumably asked)

        \ (80.28\xB0W vs 80.29\xB0W) and states FNU is \"not significantly east\"\
        \ rather than saying they're exactly equal. The presence of any difference,\
        \ even if small, means this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on analyzing the longitudes of
        both locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        the College of Pharmacy is west of the School of Public Health, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that the College of Pharmacy is not east of the School

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location
        was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (cannot be confirmed)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify the relationship due to lack of precise
        historical records, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        The model explicitly states that City University is west of Antioch University,
        indicating a directional difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, noting that
        City University is to the west of Antioch University. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about relative
        positions (stating City University is not east of Antioch University)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Buffalo (D'Youville)
        is west of Harrisonburg (EMU). The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating that D'Youville University
        is west of (not east of) Eastern Mennonite University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Buffalo (D'Youville)
        is "further west" than Harrisonburg (Eastern Mennonite), indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
        comparative result indicating D'Youville University is not east of Eastern
        Mennonite University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because D'Youville
        University is located west of Eastern Mennonite University, not because the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of/within SMU's campus, not because the locations
        are equal/identical. While they share the same campus, the model emphasizes
        that one is "part of" or "within" the other, rather than stating they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the spatial relationship between
        the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical. Rather, it explains that one institution is
        part of the other, making the comparison invalid. The NO is based on the logical
        impossibility of the comparison due to containment, not because of equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a comparative result based on the relationship between
        the locations (one being part of the other).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/identical/the same. Instead, it explains that since Meadows School
        is part of SMU, it cannot be east of SMU. This is a logical/structural reason
        rather than an equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion regarding the eastward positioning comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's explanation indicates that Meadows School
        of the Arts and SMU are in the same location because one is part of the other,
        effectively stating they are in the same place. This equality of location
        is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the locations are not separate
        (one is part of the other), it does not explicitly state they are at the same
        coordinates or have equal positions. Instead, it explains that one is contained
        within the other, which is a different type of relationship than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School is part of/on the SMU campus, not because the locations are equal.
        While being "part of" might imply a shared location, the model doesn't explicitly
        state they are at the same/identical/equal position as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/identical - rather, it's because one location is contained
        within the other. The model explains that Meadows School is part of SMU's
        campus, making the comparison invalid, but does not state they are at the
        same coordinates or equal position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Meadows
        School of the Arts is part of SMU and shares the exact same location ("it
        shares the same geographical location as SMU itself"). The equality of location
        is the primary reason given for why one cannot be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the model's reasoning that
        one location cannot be directionally relative to itself since they are the
        same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explains that Meadows School is "part of" and "within" SMU,
        which is a different relationship than equality. The NO answer is based on
        this containment relationship rather than equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Meadows School of the Arts
        is part of SMU and "shares the same location." This equality of location is
        explicitly stated and is the primary reason given for the NO answer - they
        can't be east of each other because they're in the same place.

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Ipswich is southwest
        of Biddeford, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer was given
        because Ipswich is in a different direction (southwest) than what was being
        asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ukiah (Dharma Realm Buddhist
        University) is east of Arcata (Cal Poly Humboldt), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Cal Poly Humboldt is not east of Dharma Realm Buddhist University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being west of the other. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Clarion, PA,
        is further west than Buena Vista, VA" and concludes that Clarion is west of
        Buena Vista. The NO answer is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that PennWest Clarion is not east of Southern Virginia
        University. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model didn't claim the values were
        equal - it stated the comparison was invalid because the premises were incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premises of the question, stating
        that one institution is online-only and the other doesn't have a campus in
        Mesa, making the comparison invalid. While it does say "NO" at the end, this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the premises rather than making a comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it instead stated that one of the locations doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the locations (Wilkes University in Mesa, AZ) doesn't exist. While
        it says "NO" in its final answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premises rather than making a comparative judgment, which falls under
        our UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist as specified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Wilkes
        University is not in Mesa, AZ but in Pennsylvania, making the comparison impossible.
        Although it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the
        premises of the question rather than making a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model did
        not cite equality of values as a reason for its response - it rejected the
        premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to the incorrect premise
        in the question)" and rejects the premise by noting that Wilkes University
        is not in Mesa, AZ. When a model rejects the premises of the question, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        Wilkes University doesn't have a campus in Mesa, AZ. While it does say "NO"
        in its final answer, this NO is followed by an explanation that the comparison
        cannot be made due to one location not existing, making this a rejection of
        premises rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question contains
        incorrect information, so it cannot be answered with a YES or NO." Since it
        rejects the premise of the question (stating one location doesn't exist where
        specified), this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Notre Dame of Maryland University is
        "slightly more to the east than Coppin State University." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two universities. The answer is explicitly stated and based on a clear directional
        comparison.

        saying that "Coppin State University is west of Notre Dame of Maryland University."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that Coppin State is
        NOT east of Notre Dame of Maryland University because Coppin State is west
        of Notre Dame.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found that one location
        is "slightly east" of the other, not because they are equal/same. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, even if described as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Coppin State University is west of Notre Dame of Maryland
        University (not east of it).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coppin State University is
        located to the west of Notre Dame of Maryland University, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Coppin State University is not located east
        of Notre Dame of Maryland University. The model provides a definitive comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Coppin State being west of Notre Dame of Maryland University. This difference
        in position, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined Drury
        University is west of Missouri State University, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (Benton
        Avenue is west of National Avenue), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Drury University is not east of
        Missouri State University (specifically stating it is west instead).

        east-west difference" and that they are "roughly aligned," it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical in position, and this approximate
        alignment isn't given as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model simply
        states that one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result addressing the east-west positioning
        question.

        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether KCU is east of ODU. The answer is explicit and

        KCU is "slightly southwest of Columbus, OH" and "west of ODU" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The values being compared are not
        stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in position, saying one is "slightly west" of the other. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means the values are not equal,
        so this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that Kentucky Christian University

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that KCU is west of ODU, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO is because the premise (KCU being east of ODU) is false
        due to this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that KCU is west of ODU, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Wilmington
        is north and "slightly west" of Dover, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Widener University is not east of Delaware State University.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Widener is north of Delaware State). The model gives a specific directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that Widener University is not east of
        Delaware State University. The answer is definitive and based on geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Wilmington is "slightly to the west of Dover" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Widener University is not east of Delaware State
        University because Wilmington is west of Dover.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Widener is northwest
        of Delaware State, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on
        Widener being northwest rather than east of Delaware State.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Widener University is northwest
        of Delaware State University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wilmington is slightly west
        of Dover," indicating a directional difference. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Widener University is west of Delaware State
        University, making a clear comparative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Widener was determined to be northwest of Delaware State, indicating a different
        relative position. The model explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Wilmington being "slightly west of Dover"), not because the locations
        are equal. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means
        we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, saying that SWOSU is "west of" Jamestown, ND, and describes the
        locations as being "significantly west" of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that SWOSU is not east of
        University of Jamestown. This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that SWOSU is southwest
        of the University of Jamestown, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination.
        The answer directly addresses the comparative question about whether SWOSU
        is east of the University of Jamestown.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location (Cordoba University) does not exist. When a model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        there was a directional difference (St. Louis being northwest of Jackson),
        not because the locations were equal. The model explicitly noted a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that St. Louis is northwest of Jackson, making it a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Saint Louis,
        MO, is farther west than Jackson, MS" and "Jackson, MS, is situated to the
        east of Saint Louis, MO." The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        direct comparative answer to the question of whether one location is east
        of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city, it does not explicitly state that they are at the exact same
        location or have equal coordinates. Instead, the NO answer is based on the
        inability to determine relative positions without specific street addresses
        ("one cannot be definitively east of the other without specific street addresses").
        This is a case of insufficient information rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion, making this a clear NO response. The model arrives at this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city, it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly the same location
        or longitude. Instead, it says there is "no significant eastward or westward
        displacement," which implies there might be some minimal difference. Since
        it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/same/identical as the primary
        reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states they are in different parts of Newton (western vs eastern)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that MSPP is in western Newton
        while Newton College was in eastern Newton.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,

        the eastern edge of Savannah than South University," indicating a difference
        in positions. Even though both are in Savannah, the model identifies a directional
        difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both institutions are in
        the same city and "geographically very close," it doesn't explicitly state
        they are at exactly the same location or longitude. Being in the same city
        doesn't necessarily mean identical positions, and the model states they are
        "not significantly" different rather than stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a direct comparative conclusion rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.

    8dd7d65e-dfc8-405f-9c6a-e28dafb01cc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both institutions are in the
        same city (Savannah), it does not explicitly state they are at exactly the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Being in the same city is not equivalent
        to having identical positions, and the model uses this proximity to conclude
        one is not east of the other, rather than stating they are at the exact same
        spot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes they are "in close proximity" but makes
        its NO determination based on the lack of evidence for one being distinctly
        east of the other. This is not the same as stating they are at equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates both institutions are in
        the same city (Savannah), it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location or have identical coordinates. It just says they are "in
        the same general geographic area" and "one is not significantly east or west
        of the other" which implies there could still be some minor difference in
        position.

    ca2cf783-52a1-4be5-bf80-a080bc574aea:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions without
        specific addresses. Since the model states it "cannot definitively say" the
        relative positions, this is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that South University is west of Ralston
        College, indicating a difference in position. The model concludes "South University
        is situated to the west of Ralston College" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that CSU has multiple campuses in different
        directions relative to Art Center College of Design, with some being east
        and others being west or south. The NO answer is based on this directional
        variation, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that CSULA is southwest
        of Pasadena (where Art Center is located), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that CSU is not located east of Art Center College of Design. The
        model provides a specific directional comparison (stating CSU is southwest
        of Art Center) and gives a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that CSULA
        is southwest of Art Center College of Design, indicating a directional difference.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical
        - it explicitly states they are in different positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (CSU being west/southwest of Art Center), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with
        one being southwest of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that CSU Long Beach is west (not east) of Art Center
        College of Design.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model did not indicate equal values
        - it actually indicated that different CSU campuses are at different locations
        relative to Art Center.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (without specifying a particular
        CSU campus)" and explains that it cannot make the comparison because CSU has
        multiple campuses. Since the model is rejecting the premise of the question
        (comparing a multi-campus system to a specific location), this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        physically.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that the comparison "cannot be answered definitively" because one institution
        lacks a physical location. This indicates the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist
        physically.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (the question cannot be answered
        definitively)" and explains that it cannot make the comparison because one
        institution lacks a physical location. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated that one location doesn't have physical coordinates
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location doesn't have a physical presence,
        making the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the
        question (in this case, that both locations have physical coordinates that
        can be compared), the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        in position. The NO answer was given because Loyola is west of ICO, not east
        as asked in the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it specifically notes that Vallejo is "slightly northeast of Oakland"
        and bases its NO answer on being "primarily north" rather than on any equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer,

        east-west positions. Instead, it notes that Vallejo is "slightly to the northeast
        of Oakland," indicating there is a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer is based on the position not being "significantly east" rather
        than being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as the final answer, indicating that California

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Memphis being southwest of Belleville), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, determining that Memphis is southwest
        of Belleville and therefore not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Memphis is
        southwest of Belleville, indicating a difference in position, and this directional
        difference (not equality) is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear directional determination that
        Memphis is not east of Belleville.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is southwest of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference (Memphis is southwest
        of Belleville).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Memphis is
        "southwest of Belleville"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final answer: NO" and provides
        a directional comparison indicating Memphis is southwest of Belleville, not
        east of it.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on the fact that one
        location is west of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that the University of Tennessee College of Dentistry
        is not east of Lindenwood University-Belleville, providing directional reasoning
        for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was found to be west of the other, indicating a difference in
        position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that one location
        is west of the other rather than east.
