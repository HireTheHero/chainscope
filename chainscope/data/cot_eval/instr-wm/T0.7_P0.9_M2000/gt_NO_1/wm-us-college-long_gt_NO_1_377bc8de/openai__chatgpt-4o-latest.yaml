        than east as the question asked. The model identified a clear directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of both places. The model determined that "the
        Center for Politics is located west of the International Residential College"

        of the locations. It determined that Hodges University is west of Muskingum
        University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Kansas City is geographically farther
        north and slightly to the east of Joplin" but then concludes that "in terms
        of longitude, Kansas City is west of Joplin." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its final answer section, making a clear comparative judgment that Calvary
        University is not east of Missouri Southern State University, but rather is
        west of it.

        it states that Kansas City (where Calvary University is) is "north and slightly
        east of Joplin" but concludes NO because it's "not significantly east" and
        "mostly north". This indicates a difference in values (there is a slight eastward
        component), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Calvary University is east of Missouri Southern State University.

        of Missouri Southern State University." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Apollos University does not
        have a widely recognized California campus east of Duarte" as the reason for
        its NO answer. This indicates a lack of existence in the specified location
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is likely
        NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. While it uses the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        physical campus of Apollos University in California that is definitively east
        of Duarte" and "there is no clear basis to place it east of Duarte, CA." The
        model is not claiming the locations have the same longitude, but rather that
        it cannot verify that Apollos University is east of the other institution.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides contradictory information about
        Apollos University (first saying it's in California, then saying it's registered
        in Montana) and concludes that Apollos "does not have a specific physical
        location that is clearly east of Duarte." This indicates a lack of clear positioning
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides this as a clear comparative result after analyzing the locations
        of both institutions.

        Graduate School in Duarte." The model is indicating a specific directional
        difference (west), not equality.

        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "the question cannot be conclusively
        answered with a simple YES or NO" because Apollos University does not have
        a definitive California location to compare. The model is essentially refusing
        to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because "Apollos University
        does not have a known physical presence in California anymore, and if it did,
        it would likely not be east of Duarte." This indicates a difference in locations
        (one in Montana, one in California) rather than equality as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests uncertainty about Apollos University's
        exact location, noting it's an online institution possibly associated with
        Montana, and states that the available information doesn't indicate it's east
        of Duarte. The model doesn't claim the locations are identical or equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Available information
        does not strongly indicate that Apollos University is located east of Duarte,
        CA" and then gives a clear "NO" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Apollos University is not specifically
        east of City of Hope Graduate School" which indicates a directional assessment
        rather than equality. The model suggests Apollos University might be west
        of City of Hope or in another relative position, but doesn't claim they're

        have a fixed California location to compare with City of Hope Graduate School,
        making the comparison not well-defined. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to make a meaningful comparison due to the lack of a fixed location for one
        entity, not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Thus, the best answer

        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that ASU West Campus
        (New College) is farther west compared to GCU, and based on this comparison,
        provides a definitive "NO" answer.
