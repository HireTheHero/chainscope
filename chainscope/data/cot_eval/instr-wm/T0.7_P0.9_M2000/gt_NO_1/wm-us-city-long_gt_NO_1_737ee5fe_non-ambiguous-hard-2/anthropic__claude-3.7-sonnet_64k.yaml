      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga, IN is located
        west of Dortches, NC, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (west vs east),
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Cayuga, IN is not located
        east of Dortches, NC. It is located west of Dortches, NC." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga is west of
        Dortches, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model explains that "Cayuga is actually west of Dortches" and that "any city
        in North Carolina, including Dortches, would be east of any city in Indiana,
        including Cayuga." This clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cayuga, Indiana is located east of Dortches, North Carolina. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga, IN is west
        of Dortches, NC, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that Indiana is in the Midwest while North Carolina
        is on the East Coast, and it compares their longitude ranges to show that
        North Carolina is east of Indiana.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK is west
        of Old Miakka, FL, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on any
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Turley, OK is located east of Old Miakka, FL. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response with "## NO" and then reaffirmed with "Turley,
        OK is not located east of Old Miakka, FL. It is located west of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK is west
        of Old Miakka, FL, indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Turley, OK is not located
        east of Old Miakka, FL. It is located west of Old Miakka, FL." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK is west
        of Old Miakka, FL, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that Oklahoma is west of Florida, not that
        they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Turley, OK is west of Old
        Miakka, FL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model states "Turley, OK must be west of Old Miakka, FL (not east)" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Turley, OK is not located east of Old Miakka, FL.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK is located
        west of Old Miakka, FL, indicating a difference in their locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Turley is west of Old Miakka, not that they have
        the same longitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Turley, OK being west of Old Miakka, FL. The
        model's reasoning is based on the difference in positions (Oklahoma being
        west of Florida), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO, Turley, OK is not located
        east of Old Miakka, FL" in its thinking section and concludes with "# Answer:
        NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'
