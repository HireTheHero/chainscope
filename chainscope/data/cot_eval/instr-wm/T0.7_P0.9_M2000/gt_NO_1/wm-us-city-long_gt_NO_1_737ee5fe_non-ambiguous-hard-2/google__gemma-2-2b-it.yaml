      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not make any statement about the values being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to find
        the locations on a map and compare them, but did not actually make the comparison
        itself or provide a definitive answer. The response ends with an offer to
        help with the map step, indicating the model did not complete the requested
        comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Indiana and North Carolina
        are in different states" and concludes that "Cayuga, IN is not located east
        of Dortches, NC." The model is making a directional comparison and determining
        that one is not east of the other, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Cayuga, IN is not located east of Dortches,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Indiana and North
        Carolina are in different regions (Midwest vs Southeast) and concludes NO
        without explicitly stating the locations have equal values. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply gives "NO" as the answer without explaining
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. The
        model doesn't provide any reasoning for its NO answer, so we cannot determine
        that equality was the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"
        at the end of the response.'

        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to solve the problem
        (find both locations on a map and compare them) without actually executing
        those steps or providing a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know
        the result!" indicating the model is asking the user to perform the comparison
        rather than providing an answer itself.

        NC." The model is claiming that Cayuga is not east of Dortches based on their
        relative positions (Indiana being in the Midwest and North Carolina being

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without those tools." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        or tools to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cayuga, IN is located
        in a different state than Dortches, NC" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is pointing out a difference (different states/geographic regions),
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal or the
        same. The response simply lists steps to find the locations and compare them,
        followed by "NO" without elaboration on whether the values are equal or different.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "South Dakota is east of Texas"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "South Dakota is to the west of Texas." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It notes that Deadwood is in western South Dakota while
        Simonton is in southern Texas, and makes a general statement about eastern
        vs western US locations, but doesn't explicitly state they have equal distances
        or positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Deadwood, SD is
        not located east of Simonton, TX" without indicating that they are at the
        same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled at the end with

    6b7a899f-0beb-4bf4-8f77-ff8e9a30148f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (South Dakota vs. Texas) and that these states "are separated by a
        large area of the country." The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

    a4e64ea7-c32a-4ddf-b84c-a4936e3d8a59:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states the locations of the two
        cities (Deadwood in western US, Simonton in south-central Texas) and concludes
        with NO without explicitly stating they are at the same longitude or equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    ba3116d3-9087-4962-a706-cb58782cf48c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually implies they are different by saying "Deadwood,
        SD is located in the western part of South Dakota, while Simonton, TX is in
        the southeastern part of Texas." The model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "South Dakota
        is to the east of Texas" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.

    f4c2e352-539a-4397-8fe8-b4bd4e2c3fdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "NO" after suggesting
        to compare the locations and asking "Do they overlap?" but doesn't explicitly
        say they are equal or identical as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about whether the values being compared are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer
        but did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The model simply explained
        how one would determine the answer without actually providing that answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both cities and compare) but did not actually provide the result of that comparison.
        The model ended by offering help with finding locations rather than giving

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer" as its
        final response. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question, and instead indicates that it cannot make the determination without
        access to a map. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the cities are "on opposite sides of the country" with Portageville
        in Missouri and Quentin in Pennsylvania, implying a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Portageville is not located east of Quentin" and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional statement "Illinois
        is to the east of Pennsylvania" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is making a comparison and finding a difference in location, not equality.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find both cities
        on a map and determine which is east of the other) but did not actually provide
        the answer. The model indicated that "you'll need to use a map to answer"
        without giving a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually implies they are different by noting their
        relative locations (Grayville in eastern Illinois and Darby in eastern Pennsylvania),
        but doesn't explicitly state that this difference is why the answer is NO.
        The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer based on equality
        or inequality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "Pennsylvania is to the East of Illinois." This indicates the locations have
        different positions, not equal ones.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this question," indicating it cannot

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't provide any explicit reason
        for the NO answer beyond stating the locations and mentioning that one needs
        to think about which state is on the East Coast and which is on the West Coast.
        Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states "Since North Carolina is further south than Connecticut, Vander,
        NC is not east of Noank, CT." The model is using the north-south positioning
        as reasoning, not claiming the locations have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Instead, it states "I cannot definitively answer whether Knightsville, IN
        is located east of Bantam, CT" because it can't access maps or real-time information.
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        The reason for the NO is not that the locations are at the same longitude
        or have equal east-west positions, but rather that they are in different states
        and the model concludes South Lyon is not east of Crown Heights.

        Valrico, FL is on the East Coast and Plattsburgh, NY is on the East Coast,
        they are in the same region." This indicates the model is saying NO because
        the locations share the same characteristic (both being on the East Coast),

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to
        be that both locations are on the East Coast of the United States. The model
        states "Tavares, FL is located on the East Coast of the United States, while
        Mauricetown, NJ is also on the East Coast of the United States." This indicates
        the model is saying NO because the locations share the same characteristic
        (both being on the East Coast), which implies equality in terms of their eastward
        position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Tavares, FL is located in Florida, while Mauricetown, NJ is located
        in New Jersey. Since these two locations are on different states, Tavares
        is not located east of Mauricetown." The model is not claiming the locations

        claims that Florida and New Jersey are on different continents and bases its
        NO answer on directional reasoning. Since equality of values is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, Tavares, FL

        NO answer. This indicates a difference in location (being on opposite coasts),
        not equality.

        Bella Villa, MO is in the central part of Missouri." The model concludes that
        Helotes is not east of Bella Villa based on their relative positions, not
        because they are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Helotes, TX is not east of
        Bella Villa, MO because of their relative positions (Texas and Missouri being
        on opposite sides of the Mississippi River). The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

        stating "Texas is to the west of Missouri" and therefore "Helotes, TX is located
        east of Bella Villa, MO" is incorrect. The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        and Bella Villa is in Missouri, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating that the equality of values is the reason for the NO answer.

        (find both locations on a map and compare them) but did not actually execute
        these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know your

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find both locations on a map and compare them), but did not actually
        execute these steps or provide a conclusion. The response ends by offering
        to help with the map step, indicating the model did not complete the analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this question"
        which indicates it is unable to make the determination without additional
        resources. The model is essentially refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Illinois and Pennsylvania are separate states, and it concludes that
        Elburn, IL is not located east of East Prospect, PA. The model is making a
        directional claim (not about equality), so this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer
        (locate both places on a map and compare) but did not actually perform the
        comparison or state a conclusion. The model suggested the user would need

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Ohio and New Jersey "are separated
        by a significant distance," indicating a difference in location rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a definite answer
        without a map" and "the answer cannot be determined with the information given."
        The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison without additional information
        (a map), which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to answer the question (locations of Pleasant Run, OH and Cape May,
        NJ) and suggests using a map to find the answer. The model acknowledges it
        doesn't have the necessary information and suggests the user would need to
        use a map application or website to determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Pleasant Run, OH
        is in eastern Ohio and Cape May, NJ is on the eastern coast of New Jersey,
        and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the locations have
        equal values or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Pleasant Run,
        OH and Cape May, NJ.

        the values are the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot determine the answer without additional information.
        This is effectively saying it cannot make the comparison with the information
        available.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "Goreville, IL is located in Illinois
        and South Russell, OH is in Ohio. They are in different states and therefore
        are not located in the same direction." The model is giving a different reason
        for its NO answer - that the locations are in different states and different
        directions, not that they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it just outlined steps for how to find
        the answer (find both locations on a map and compare them) without actually
        performing the comparison or stating a conclusion. The response ends with
        "Let me know the answer!" indicating the model is asking the user to do the
        comparison rather than providing an answer itself.

        The model did not make any statement about equality or difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to determine the answer but
        did not actually provide a final YES or NO answer to the comparison question.
        It simply outlined a methodology without reaching a conclusion. The response
        ends with an offer to elaborate further rather than providing a definitive
        answer.

        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a definitive
        YES or NO answer without a map." The model is refusing to provide a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives other reasons for the NO answer -
        specifically that the locations are in different states separated by the Mississippi
        River. The model is noting differences between the locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "Missouri is to the east of Florida" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The
        model is providing a specific directional relationship as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." as its final answer,
        which is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a final answer. It did not state YES or NO, nor did
        it refuse to answer. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to find the answer
        themselves and offered help if needed. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Missouri and Florida are in different
        geographic regions of the US, which implies a difference rather than equality.
        The model does not claim the locations have equal or identical values of any
        kind.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, noting that "Missouri is to the north of Florida." This
        indicates the locations have different positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Puxico, MO is in Missouri
        while Ojus, FL is in Florida, and based on their geographic positions, Puxico
        is not east of Ojus. The model is indicating a directional difference (implying
        Puxico is west of Ojus), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Puxico, MO is **not** located
        east of Ojus, FL" and explicitly concludes with "**Answer:** NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a definitive negative answer to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model provided steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually give a final YES or NO answer. It only suggested how someone
        could determine the answer themselves by looking at a map. Since there is
        no explicit YES or NO statement, and the model did not provide a clear conclusion,

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply gives a "NO" answer without
        explaining that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There is no mention of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While the model doesn't provide detailed reasoning,
        it does give a clear "NO" response after outlining steps to determine the
        answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer
        and ended by asking if the user wanted help finding a map to determine the
        answer. The model did not commit to any conclusion about the relative positions
        of Energy, IL and University Heights, OH.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to determine
        the answer and what the answer would be based on different possible outcomes.
        Since the model did not actually complete these steps or provide a final determination,
        the answer is UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer but did not
        actually state whether Turley, OK is east of Old Miakka, FL. The response
        ends with "you'll determine if..." without providing that determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c9817ecf-d9ca-440b-a825-3a6bd08056bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "Turley, OK is not located
        east of Old Miakka, FL" without indicating that the locations have the same
        longitude or are at the same position. The model is making a directional comparison
        and concluding that one is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to whether Turley, OK is located east of Old Miakka,
        FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d0fbc27a-98f7-4440-9026-7b877088296e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model mentions that
        the locations are in different states, but doesn't explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The reasoning is incomplete, but there's
        no indication that the NO is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the reasoning is incomplete, the model clearly provides "NO" as its
        comparative result.
