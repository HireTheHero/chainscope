      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Helotes, TX is west
        of Bella Villa, MO, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Missouri is east of Texas,
        and specifically that Bella Villa (in eastern Missouri) is east of Helotes
        (in south-central Texas).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Helotes, TX located east of Bella Villa, MO?" The model
        clearly concludes that "Helotes, TX is west of Bella Villa, MO (not east)"
        and provides a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Old Miakka, FL is east of
        Turley, OK (not the other way around), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model specifically notes that Florida has lower
        longitude numbers than Oklahoma, showing they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Turley, OK is not located east of Old Miakka, FL.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Old Miakka (in Florida) is east of Turley (in Oklahoma), not the other way
        around. The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the question of
        whether Turley, OK is located east of Old Miakka, FL.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c7385ce6-485b-449a-a136-fc17fb45373c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley is west of
        Old Miakka, not east. The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference
        (Oklahoma being west of Florida), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Turley, OK is NOT located east of Old Miakka, FL. This is
        a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d324eefc-dddf-4cf7-a699-2eb93da0f0a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Florida is east of Oklahoma,
        meaning that Old Miakka, FL is east of Turley, OK (not the other way around
        as asked in the question). The model is saying NO because the direction is
        reversed, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Turley, OK is not located east of Old Miakka, FL.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    df2b436f-203e-48c6-903f-9cbb192b8beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley is west of
        Old Miakka, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model's reasoning is that "Turley is in Oklahoma (western) and Old Miakka
        is in Florida (eastern), Turley is west of Old Miakka, not east of it" - which
        shows the locations have different longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Turley, OK is not located east of Old Miakka, FL.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
