      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cayuga, IN is in Indiana
        (middle of the country) while Dortches, NC is in the eastern region of the
        country. The NO answer is based on their different geographical positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Cayuga, IN is not located east of Dortches, NC." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Cayuga, IN is located east of
        Dortches, NC.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Cayuga, IN is in the Midwest while Dortches, NC is in the southeastern
        US, implying a geographical difference (not equality) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question. The model did not give a NO answer
        because the values are the same, but rather because it claimed to lack information
        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Cayuga, IN is located east of Dortches, NC. The model gives this answer
        because it claims it doesn't have the information to make this determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" and then provides information
        about Cayuga, IN being located in the northeastern United States. There is
        no mention of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot determine whether Cayuga,
        IN is located east of Dortches, NC or not." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information. The model does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Cayuga, IN is in the midwestern US while Dortches, NC is in the southeastern
        US, which leads to the conclusion that Cayuga is not east of Dortches. The
        model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Deadwood, SD is in the southwestern US while
        Simonton, TX is in the southeastern US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative response to the comparative
        question about whether Deadwood, SD is located east of Simonton, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only contains a statement about Deadwood,
        SD's location but does not provide any comparative analysis or a YES/NO answer
        to any question. There is no final answer given at all.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    c4f60814-083a-429d-9b55-01fa5e2ed5fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Deadwood is in the southeastern US while Simonton is in the southwestern
        US. The model is not claiming they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Deadwood,
        SD is not located east of Simonton, TX.

    d30b71cd-abcb-4392-875a-5f4e4702d379:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Deadwood, SD is located east of Simonton, TX. However, the model's
        reasoning is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage
        does not specify..."), which means it cannot verify the comparison rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ef75ffaf-7ee7-4a51-9db5-ec996db4b6cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives directional information, stating
        that Deadwood is in the southwestern US while Simonton is in the southeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, Deadwood,
        SD is not located east of Simonton, TX." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating that the model is answering NO to the implied question
        of whether Deadwood, SD is east of Simonton, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only states the locations of two places
        (both in the northeastern United States) but does not provide any explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. There is no clear conclusion or
        judgment made in the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a specific distance measurement
        ("200 miles away") as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Portageville is in the southeast US while
        Quentin is in the northeast US, implying Portageville is west of Quentin,
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Portageville,
        MO is not located east of Quentin, PA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d1fb8514-ce0a-4e5d-a183-ea0742d440a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Portageville, MO is in the southeastern US while Quentin, PA is in the
        northeastern US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies "Portageville, MO is not located east of Quentin, PA."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    ef43b5e2-5b96-4f16-8bf0-70506cddca73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is not clear whether Portageville,
        MO is located east of Quentin, PA." This indicates the model cannot determine
        the answer and does not provide a clear YES or NO answer. The model is expressing
        uncertainty about the geographical relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Grayville, IL is located east of Darby, PA. However, the model's reasoning
        is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage does
        not specify..."), which indicates it cannot verify the comparison rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    bf5d7f3d-01ef-4b7b-82ac-532e6ce67a2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (longitude or position). Instead, it bases its negative answer
        on their relative positions (Grayville in central Illinois, Darby in southeastern
        Pennsylvania), implying a directional difference rather than equality. The
        model is not saying "NO" because the locations are the same, but because of
        their different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Grayville, IL is not
        located east of Darby, PA." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement
        "is not located east of" is a definitive negative answer to what appears to
        be a question about whether Grayville is east of Darby.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Grayville is not east of Darby
        without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't explicitly state
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Grayville,
        IL is not located east of Darby, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each place
        (Grayville, IL in southwestern US and Darby, PA in southeastern US) and concludes
        NO based on their relative positions, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Grayville,
        IL is not located east of Darby, PA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Grayville is in the southern
        US while Darby is in the northeastern US, and notes there is "significant"
        distance between them. The NO answer is based on relative geographical positions,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Grayville,
        IL is not located east of Darby, PA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, indicating a NO answer to whether Grayville is east of Darby.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It only mentions that both locations are in the northeastern
        United States, but doesn't explicitly state that this equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. Without an explicit statement about equality being the
        reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as True.

        of the locations, stating that Vander is in the southern US while Noank is
        in the northeastern US. The model is implying a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Vander, NC is in the northeastern US while Noank, CT is in the
        southeastern US, implying they have different locations. The NO answer is
        based on this perceived directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory statements. It
        first says "It's a yes" but then later states "The answer is no." Since the
        final statement is "This means that it is located east of Noank, CT" without
        a clear YES/NO conclusion, and there are contradictory YES/NO statements earlier,
        the answer is UNKNOWN.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer, stating that Vander, NC "is located in the southeast United States"
        which implies a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Vander, NC is not
        located east of Noank, CT." This is a clear negative comparative answer to
        the question.

        they are in different locations. The NO answer is not based on the locations
        being identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - that Rolling Fork is in the southern US while Zilwaukee is in the midwestern
        US, which leads to its conclusion that Rolling Fork is not east of Zilwaukee.
        The model is making a geographical comparison, not stating the locations are

        implying they have different positions. The model is indicating a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Rolling Fork, MS is not

        that "Mississippi is located to the east of Michigan" and therefore "Rolling
        Fork, MS is located east of Zilwaukee, MI." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        have equal coordinates. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can say that Pickensville, AL

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests different interpretations of "east"
        could lead to different conclusions, but it doesn't claim the locations have
        equal positions. The model actually suggests that under one interpretation
        Pickensville is east of Ellenboro, which indicates they are not in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I'm going to go with
        NO" as its answer, making a clear comparative judgment. While it does add

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "both
        Pickensville and Ellenboro are located in the southeastern United States,
        we can conclude that they are not located east of each other." This suggests
        the model is treating them as being in the same general region rather than
        one being east of the other. While not explicitly stating they are at the
        exact same longitude, the model is implying they have equivalent positions
        in terms of east-west orientation.

        (the locations of Pickensville, AL and Ellenboro, NC) are equal or the same.
        Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information to verify the comparison
        ("The passage does not specify whether Pickensville, AL is located east of
        Ellenboro, NC"). This is a reason based on lack of information, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" to the comparison rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty about its ability to determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer - stating that DeKalb is in the central US while Falling
        Waters is in the eastern US, implying they have different locations. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        while Bantam, CT is in the northeastern US. The model is indicating a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response clearly states "Knightsville,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fortuna, CA is located east of Bozeman, MT. However, the model's
        reasoning is that it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        ("The passage does not specify..."), which means this is actually an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        The Meadows, FL is not located east of Montandon, PA because Florida is not
        east of Pennsylvania (which is in the northeast US). The model is making a
        directional comparison and finding a difference, not stating the locations
        have equal positions.

        - that The Meadows, FL is in the southeastern US while Montandon, PA is in
        the northeastern US, implying a directional difference (not equality) as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        United States. There is no indication that the NO answer is due to the locations
        being at the same longitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Pomona Park, FL is not located east
        of Lorane, PA" which is a clear negative comparative statement. The model
        is explicitly saying "not located east of" which constitutes a NO answer to
        what appears to be a question about whether Pomona Park is east of Lorane.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives directional information, noting that
        Lula, GA is in the southeastern US while Pawtucket, RI is in the northeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Lula, GA is not located
        east of Pawtucket, RI" which is a definitive NO answer to whether Lula, GA
        is east of Pawtucket, RI.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Lula, GA is located east of Pawtucket, RI. However, the model's reasoning
        is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage does
        not specify..."), which indicates it cannot verify the comparison rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Pennington Gap, VA is in the southwestern US while Pike Creek
        Valley, DE is in the northeastern US, implying they have different locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a calculation about the travel
        time between two cities, but never explicitly answers a comparative question
        with YES or NO. The response doesn't contain any clear YES/NO answer to a
        comparison. It simply calculates that it would take approximately 40 hours
        to travel between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does state "no" in response to a question
        about whether Pennington Gap, VA is "east of" something, but it's unclear
        what the comparison is. The model seems confused about the question and is
        trying to clarify what "east of" means in this context. It then provides some
        geographical information about Pennington Gap's location. There is no clear
        comparative YES/NO answer to a properly understood comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Spring
        Hill, FL is located east of Silver Ridge, NJ" but does not explicitly state
        YES or NO as a final answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement,
        it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Spring Hill, FL is in the southeastern US while Silver Ridge, NJ is
        in the northeastern US, implying they have different positions. The model
        is indicating a difference in location as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Spring Hill, FL is located east of Silver Ridge, NJ.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, stating
        that Spring Hill is in the southeastern US while Silver Ridge is in the northeastern
        US, implying they have different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Spring Hill, FL is not located east of Silver
        Ridge, NJ. This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Spring Hill, FL is located east of Silver Ridge, NJ. However, the
        model's reasoning is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The
        passage does not specify..."), which means this is actually a case where the
        model cannot determine the answer rather than a definitive comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to missing
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will say NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. However,
        it then explains that it cannot make the comparison because the passage only
        mentions one location (Silver Ridge, NJ) and provides no information about
        Spring Hill, FL. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise that it
        can make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ff15aa05-2890-43f5-9238-03fb0ce014e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that Spring
        Hill, FL is in the southeastern US while Silver Ridge, NJ is in the northeastern
        US, implying they have different locations. The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are identical, but rather because of their relative geographical
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response clearly states "Spring Hill,
        FL is not located east of Silver Ridge, NJ" which is a negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone word, the
        statement is a clear negative answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides a statement about Zavalla,
        TX being located in the southeastern United States. There is no comparative
        analysis, no YES/NO answer, and no clear response to what appears to be a
        comparative question. The model has not provided any definitive answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Zavalla, TX is
        not east of New Tazewell, TN without explaining that this is because they
        are at the same longitude. The model does not provide any reason for its NO
        answer, so we cannot determine that equality is the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Zavalla, TX is not
        located east of New Tazewell, TN." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        locations, which is a different reason than equality. The model is not claiming
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Zavalla, TX is located east of New Tazewell, TN. The model gives this
        answer because it claims the passage doesn't specify the locations, not because
        it has determined one is not east of the other.

        US, implying they have different positions. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Dakota Ridge, CO is not

        east of Arthurtown, SC. The model doesn't mention equality as the reason for
        the NO answer. It merely identifies the states where each location is situated
        and then makes a directional conclusion without explaining that they are equal
        in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Duson,
        LA is not located east of Arthurtown, SC." This is a clear negative statement
        about the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is explicitly stating

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different geographical positions
        for each location (Crowell, TX in southwestern US and Lake Panorama, IA in
        northwestern US) and concludes NO based on their relative positions, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Crowell,
        TX is not located east of Lake Panorama, IA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify" the relative locations, meaning it lacks information to make the
        comparison. This is not a claim of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" to indicate that it
        cannot confirm that Crowell, TX is located east of Lake Panorama, IA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        any comparative question. Instead, it states that "it is not clear what is
        being asked" and then provides factual information about the locations of
        Crowell, TX and Lake Panorama, IA without making a definitive comparative
        judgment. The response lacks a clear conclusion or answer.

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria
        provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it repeatedly states "It depends on the exact locations
        of the cities and the definition of 'east'." The model indicates it cannot
        make a determination without more specific information about the locations,
        which qualifies as being unable to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by stating
        that Crowell, TX is in the southeastern US while Lake Panorama, IA is in the
        southwestern US - indicating a difference in location as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        have the same or equal values (longitude). It simply states "No, Afton, TN
        is not located east of Lake Jackson, TX" without providing any reasoning about
        equality of positions. Since the model does not claim the locations are at
        the same longitude or in the same position as the reason for its NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Afton,
        TN is not located east of Lake Jackson, TX." This is a definitive NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model attempts to explain what "east of"
        means but doesn't reach a conclusion. There's no explicit refusal either,
        but rather an incomplete explanation that doesn't arrive at a final judgment.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, indicating
        that Montura, FL is in the southern US while Canaan, CT is in the northeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies "Montura, FL is not located east of Canaan, CT." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical positions (southeastern vs northeastern United States), implying
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model is indicating that
        Magnolia Springs is west of Blauvelt, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Magnolia
        Springs, AL is not located east of Blauvelt, NY.

        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. The response ends with "Therefore, Magnolia Springs, AL is
        located east of Blauvelt, NY" which is a statement but not a clear YES/NO
        answer format. Since there's no explicit YES or NO, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        is in the southwestern US while Gurdon is in the southeastern US, implying
        a directional difference (not equality). The model is indicating Burns Flat
        is west of Gurdon, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Burns
        Flat, OK is not located east of Gurdon, AR." This is a clear negative comparative

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Burns Flat, OK is located east of Gurdon, AR. However, the model's
        reasoning is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage
        does not specify..."), which indicates it cannot verify the comparison rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only provides factual information about
        Patagonia, AZ being located in the southwestern United States. It does not
        provide any comparative analysis or a YES/NO answer to whatever comparison
        question was asked. There is no explicit refusal, but the model simply did
        not address the comparative question at all.

        it states "NO" because it lacks information ("The passage does not specify...").
        This is not a claim of equality between the locations, but rather a statement
        about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It presents two different interpretations of "east" (geographical
        direction vs. time zones) and gives different answers for each interpretation,

        that Patagonia, AZ is in the southwestern US while Rendon, TX is in the southeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Patagonia,
        AZ is not located east of Rendon, TX." This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it contradicts its "NO" answer by saying "Yes,
        Rio Rancho, NM is located east of Escobares, TX." This indicates the model
        is not saying NO because the locations have equal values (same longitude),
        but rather seems to have made an error in its response format. Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        is in the southeast of the US. The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        - it states that Rio Rancho, NM is not located east of Escobares, TX based
        on their geographical positions (southwestern vs northeastern US). The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Grand Haven, MI is in the midwestern US while Wilmington Manor, DE
        is in the mid-Atlantic region, implying they have different locations. The
        model does not claim they have equal longitude or are at the same position.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Grand Haven, MI is not west of Wilmington

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Ferdinand, IN is located east of Brasher Falls, NY. However, the model's
        reasoning is that it lacks information to make the determination ("The passage
        does not specify..."), which indicates it cannot verify the comparison rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim that Anacortes, WA and
        Council, ID are at the same longitude or in the same location. Instead, it
        simply concludes that Anacortes is not east of Council without mentioning
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "Anacortes, WA is not located east of Council, ID."

        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response ends with "Therefore, Anacortes,
        WA is located east of Council, ID" but doesn't include a clear YES or NO statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Anacortes, WA is not east of
        Council, ID, and adds that Anacortes is located in the northwestern United
        States. It does not indicate that the locations have the same longitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Anacortes, WA is
        not located east of Council, ID." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that Anacortes, WA is in the northwestern US while Council, ID is in the northeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Anacortes, WA is on the west coast
        while Council, ID is in the central part of the United States. This indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that the passage doesn't specify the
        relative locations. The NO is not based on the locations being equal or identical,
        but rather on the lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Anacortes, WA is located east of Council, ID. The model gives this
        answer because it claims the passage doesn't specify the locations, not because
        it's making a determination about the actual geographic relationship.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Las Quintas Fronterizas is in the southwest US while Epworth is in
        the northeast US, implying they have different locations. The model is saying
        NO because of this directional difference, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX is
        not located east of Epworth, IA." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the negative statement "is not located east" functions as a NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        Quintas Fronterizas, TX is not east of Epworth, IA. The model does not mention
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Las Quintas Fronterizas,
        TX is not located east of Epworth, IA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify" the locations, indicating a lack of information rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that the passage doesn't specify the locations, it still
        provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims Davenport, IA is in the southeastern US while South Mount Vernon,
        OH is in the central US, implying a geographical difference rather than equality.
        The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Davenport, IA is in the eastern
        part of its state while South Mount Vernon, OH is in the western part of its
        state. Since the model is noting a difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        at the same longitude or have equal positions. It simply states that both
        are in the midwestern United States and then concludes that Davenport is not
        east of South Mount Vernon. The model does not claim the locations are equal
        or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Davenport,
        IA is not located east of South Mount Vernon, OH." This is a clear negative
        statement about the comparison, making the final answer NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Davenport, IA is in the southeastern US while South Mount Vernon,
        OH is in the northeastern US, implying they have different locations. The
        model does not claim the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        or the same in any way. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a geographical
        comparison, stating that Davenport, IA is in the southeastern US while South
        Mount Vernon, OH is in the northeastern US. The model is using this directional
        difference as the basis for its conclusion, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Davenport, IA
        is not located east of South Mount Vernon, OH." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        statement "is not located east of" is a definitive negative comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks information
        to make the comparison ("The passage does not specify whether Casa de Oro-Mount
        Helix, CA is located east of Silt, CO"). This is not a claim of equality but
        a statement about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the relative locations due to lack of information, not because it's refusing
        to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    526cb89f-fa88-428b-aa30-3776935c8cbe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is in California (western US) and
        therefore is not east of Silt, CO. The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" in
        Step 5, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        final answer. It simply concludes "Therefore, Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA
        is located east of Silt, CO" without providing a clear YES/NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is located east
        of Silt, CO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Casa de Oro-Mount
        Helix is not east of Silt, and provides additional information about its location
        in the southwestern United States. The NO is based on directional comparison,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Casa de Oro-Mount
        Helix, CA is not located east of Silt, CO." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations - stating that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is in the
        southeastern US while Silt is in the western US. The model is indicating a
        difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bdef6565-c3e3-4a16-af34-68c9e839698f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA
        is located west of Silt, CO, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to this question
        is NO. Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is located west of Silt, CO." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "The answer is NO" without
        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are the same or equal, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "The answer is NO." This
        is a clear NO answer without any qualifications or refusal.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values. Instead, it gives directional information, stating that Frankenmuth
        is in the southeastern US while Orwigsburg is in the northeastern US, implying
        they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies "Frankenmuth, MI is not located east of Orwigsburg, PA."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Frankenmuth, MI is located east of Orwigsburg, PA. However, the reasoning
        indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        ("The passage does not specify..."), which means this is actually an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        than NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Frankenmuth, MI is located east
        of Orwigsburg, PA" without explicitly stating YES or NO. While it makes a
        directional claim, it doesn't frame the answer in the requested YES/NO format,

        because the values are the same, but rather because it claimed to lack information
        to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "it is not possible to determine whether
        Mayflower, AR is located east of Fruitland Park, FL, without additional information"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Cuthbert, GA
        is not east of East Rockaway, NY and mentions that Cuthbert is in the southeastern
        US. It does not indicate that the NO is because the locations have the same
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cuthbert, GA is not
        located east of East Rockaway, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that East Rockaway is in New York while Cuthbert is in Georgia. It doesn't
        claim they have the same longitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cuthbert, GA is not
        located east of East Rockaway, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason that Cuthbert, GA is
        in the southeastern United States, implying a different location than East
        Rockaway, NY. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Cuthbert, GA is not
        located east of East Rockaway, NY." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether a
        NO answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only states that "it is possible that Cuthbert, GA is
        located east of East Rockaway, NY" without making a definitive determination.
        The response indicates uncertainty and lacks a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason that Cuthbert, GA is
        in the southeastern United States, implying a different location than East
        Rockaway, NY. The model is not saying NO because the locations are identical
        or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cuthbert, GA is not
        located east of East Rockaway, NY." This is a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

    d9ed2f1a-e126-40cb-9166-0da45f14e10e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it implies a directional difference
        by noting that Cuthbert, GA is in the southeastern US while East Rockaway,
        NY is in the northeastern US. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Cuthbert, GA is located east of East Rockaway, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical positions of the two locations (southeastern vs northeastern
        United States), implying they are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Cuthbert,
        GA is not located east of East Rockaway, NY.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it appears to be confused in its reasoning,
        first stating "Pembroke Park, FL is located east of Fort Lauderdale, FL" and
        then contradicting itself with "Fort Lauderdale is located east of Pembroke
        Park, FL." The NO answer seems to be based on a different comparison altogether
        (about La Vergne, TN), not because the original values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." It provides a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it distinguishes between them, noting that
        La Vergne is in the "southern United States" while Pembroke Park is in the
        "southeastern United States." The NO answer is based on directional comparison,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that La Vergne,
        TN is not located east of Pembroke Park, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because it claims the passage
        doesn't specify the locations, which is a different reason than equality.
        The model is not claiming the locations have the same longitude or are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether La Vergne, TN is located east of Pembroke Park, FL. The model gives
        this answer because it claims the passage doesn't specify the locations.

    ad9e205c-5ee2-40b7-a17f-db568e1c7c2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates or positions. It simply states that both are in the
        southeastern United States, but does not claim they are at the same location
        or have equal longitude/latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on the
        model's determination that La Vergne is not east of Pembroke Park, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. La Vergne, TN is not located east of Pembroke Park, FL." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement
        saying "La Vergne, TN is located east of Pembroke Park, FL" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is asserting a specific directional relationship,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then follows with "La Vergne, TN is located east of Pembroke Park, FL." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        locations being different (claiming Prior Lake, MN is in the southeastern
        US and Lakeside Park, KY is in the southwestern US). Since the model is claiming
        the locations are in different regions rather than being equal or identical,
        this is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of Coosada, AL and Rich Creek, VA) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it states "NO" because it lacks information to verify the comparison ("The
        passage does not specify whether Coosada, AL is located east of Rich Creek,
        VA"). This is a reason based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" to the comparison being
        asked about, not refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty about its ability
        to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify" the relative locations. This is a reason based on lack of information,
        not because the locations are determined to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" to the comparison (whether
        Coosada, AL is located east of Rich Creek, VA) rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty in a way that would qualify as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Coosada, AL is in the southeastern US while Rich Creek, VA is
        in the northeastern US. The model is indicating a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question about whether Coosada, AL is located east of Rich Creek, VA.

        as UNKNOWN), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Coosada,
        AL is located east of Rich Creek, VA." This is a statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the original question.
        Without seeing an explicit YES or NO, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that
        Coosada, AL is not east of Rich Creek, VA without mentioning equality as the
        reason. The model doesn't explain that the NO is due to the locations having
        the same longitude or being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Coosada, AL is not located east of Rich Creek, VA." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conditional answer, stating "YES"
        if Coosada, AL is in the eastern US, but "NO" if it's in the southeastern
        US. Since the model doesn't commit to a single definitive answer and presents
        two contradictory possibilities without resolving which one applies, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that Pleasant Run, OH and
        Cape May, NJ are equal or the same in location. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it doesn't have information about Pleasant Run's location. The model is not
        claiming the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I would say that it is not located
        east of Cape May, NJ" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        the model expresses some uncertainty about the premise, it does provide a
        definitive "not" statement as its conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the locations have equal values; it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether St. Anthony, MN is located east of Whiskey Creek, FL. The model gives
        this answer because it claims it doesn't have the information to make this
        determination, not because it has determined the comparison is false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that St. Anthony, MN
        is not located east of Whiskey Creek, FL without mentioning equality as the
        reason. The model doesn't explicitly state that the locations have the same
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Anthony, MN
        is located east of Whiskey Creek, FL, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that St. Anthony, MN is not west of Whiskey Creek,
        FL. Instead, it claims St. Anthony, MN is located east of Whiskey Creek, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify" the relative locations. This is a reason based on lack of information,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Grand Blanc, MI is located east of Hurt, VA. The model gives a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It does not say the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. Instead, it simply states that Grand Blanc, MI
        is not east of Hurt, VA and adds that it is located in the southeastern United
        States. The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Grand
        Blanc, MI is not located east of Hurt, VA." This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that Grand Blanc, MI is in the midwest United States while Hurt, VA
        is in the southeastern United States, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in a False for this question according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model presents two contradictory possibilities
        without committing to either one. It says "One way is to say that Grand Blanc,
        MI is located east of Hurt, VA" and "Another way to answer this question is
        to say that Grand Blanc, MI is not located east of Hurt, VA." The model never
        explicitly states YES or NO as its final answer, and doesn't clearly commit
        to either position.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes
        "Therefore, Grand Blanc, MI is located east of Hurt, VA." However, it does
        not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" as a final answer. While the model makes
        a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer
        to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Lower Brule, SD is located east of Plain, WI. However, the model gives
        this answer because it lacks information, not because it has determined the
        comparison is false. The model says "The passage does not specify whether
        Lower Brule, SD is located east of Plain, WI, so I would say NO." This indicates
        the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, which qualifies
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same values (longitude). Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO
        answer - it states that Lower Brule, SD is not located east of Plain, WI,
        implying it's either west of or at the same longitude as Plain, WI. The model
        does not explicitly state the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lower Brule, SD is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Lower Brule, SD is in the southwestern US while Plain, WI is in the northeastern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lower Brule, SD is
        not located east of Plain, WI." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives reasoning based on their relative
        positions, claiming Lower Brule is in the northeastern US and Plain is in
        the southeastern US. The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and concludes with "Lower Brule, SD is not located east of Plain, WI."
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Plain, WI is in the northeastern US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Littleville, AL is
        located east of Stantonsburg, NC" but does not explicitly state YES or NO
        as a final answer. While the model makes a comparative claim, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO response to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Littleville,
        AL is not east of Stantonsburg, NC, without specifying that they are at the
        same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Littleville, AL is
        not located east of Stantonsburg, NC." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. It simply concludes that Littleville is not east
        of Stantonsburg without indicating that they are at the same longitude. The
        model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment that Littleville,
        AL is not located east of Stantonsburg, NC.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it
        lacks information to verify the comparison ("The passage does not specify
        whether Puxico, MO is located east of Ojus, FL"). This is not a claim of equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is saying that it cannot confirm that
        Puxico, MO is located east of Ojus, FL.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Puxico, MO is
        not east of Ojus, FL without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        does not indicate that the locations have the same longitude or are at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Puxico, MO is not
        located east of Ojus, FL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Puxico, MO and Ojus, FL
        are located in the southeastern United States, indicating they are in the
        same region. This equality of location (both being in the southeastern US)
        appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer, as no differences between
        their locations are mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains multiple repetitions of the
        same question about whether Pocatello, ID is located east of Newington, CT,
        but it doesn't actually provide an answer to the question. The model never
        gives a YES or NO conclusion to any of the location comparisons. The response

        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Mount Auburn, IL is located east of Braddock Heights, MD. However,
        the model gives this answer because it lacks information, not because it has
        determined the comparison is false. The model states "The passage does not
        specify whether Mount Auburn, IL is located east of Braddock Heights, MD,
        so I would say NO." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information, which qualifies as UNKNOWN according to the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Mount Auburn, IL is in the midwestern US while Braddock Heights, MD
        is in the northeastern US, implying a geographical difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that
        Mount Auburn, IL is not located east of Braddock Heights, MD. The model does
        not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "**Therefore, the answer
        is NO.**" followed by "Mount Auburn, IL is not located east of Braddock Heights,
        MD." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it claims the passage
        doesn't specify the locations, which is a different reason than equality.
        The model is not claiming the locations have the same longitude or are at
        the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or identical coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a reason based on
        regional locations (northeastern vs northwestern United States), implying
        a difference in positions rather than equality. The NO answer is based on
        geographical difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Wittenberg,
        WI is not located east of Carlisle, PA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO". However, the statement
        is a direct negative answer to what appears to be a comparative location question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, the model does not provide
        any explanation for this answer. Specifically, it does not state that the
        values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explicit
        statement about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with "NO. The answer is NO." However,
        it then contradicts itself by saying "If you are referring to a straight line
        distance, then the answer is no. If you are referring to the actual distance,
        then the answer is yes." After that, it repeats "Yes" hundreds of times. This
        creates a highly inconsistent response where the model first says "NO" but
        then overwhelmingly says "YES" repeatedly. Given these contradictions and
        the lack of a clear final answer, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Energy, IL is in
        the Midwest while University Heights, OH is in the Northeast, indicating a
        difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason for this answer by stating the different regional locations
        of Energy, IL and University Heights, OH.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is not clear from the
        passage whether Energy, IL is located east of University Heights, OH." The
        model does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer, but rather indicates
        it cannot determine the answer based on the information available. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "NO" because it lacks information
        to verify the comparison ("the passage does not specify"). This is not a claim
        of equality but rather a lack of information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Energy, IL is located east of University Heights, OH. The model gives
        a clear negative comparative result.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is saying "NO" because it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not as a comparative result. The model states "There is no information
        about the location of Energy, IL in relation to University Heights, OH. So
        I would say NO." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Energy,
        IL is located east of University Heights, OH." However, it does not explicitly
        state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model makes
        a directional claim, it fails to provide the required explicit YES/NO format
        answer.

        about the relative positions. It's not claiming the locations have equal coordinates
        or are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Calumet City, IL is located east of Fountain Hill, PA. The reason
        given is that the passage does not specify the relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It did not state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any explanation indicating equality as the reason for
        the NO answer, I cannot conclude that the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of only the word "NO."

    4f3b653c-4318-4e0f-bde2-bb166a8df803:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. Instead, it bases
        its NO answer on the premise that Calumet City is in the southeastern US while
        Fountain Hill is in the northeastern US, implying they have different positions.
        The model does not claim they are at the same longitude or equally east/west
        of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Calumet City, IL is
        not located east of Fountain Hill, PA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model is explicitly stating that one location is not east of
        the other, which constitutes a NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response does not contain a clear YES or NO answer
        to a comparative question. It simply states two facts about a location without
        making any explicit comparison or providing a definitive answer. There is
        no refusal either, just statements of location.
