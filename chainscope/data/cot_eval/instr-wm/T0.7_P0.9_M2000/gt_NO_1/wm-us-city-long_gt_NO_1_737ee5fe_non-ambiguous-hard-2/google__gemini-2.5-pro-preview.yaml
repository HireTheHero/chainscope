        different, with Portageville being west of Quentin. The model says "Portageville,
        MO is west of Quentin, PA" and concludes NO because the question asked if
        Portageville is east of Quentin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Portageville, MO is east of Quentin, PA. The model

        west of Crown Heights, NY, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west
        vs east), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether South Lyon, MI is east of Crown Heights, NY. The
        model concludes that "South Lyon, MI is west of Crown Heights, NY. Therefore,
        it is not east of Crown Heights, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
