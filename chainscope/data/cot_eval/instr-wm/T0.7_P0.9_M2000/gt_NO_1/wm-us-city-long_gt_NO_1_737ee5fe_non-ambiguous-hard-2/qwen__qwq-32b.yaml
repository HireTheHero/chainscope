      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Cayuga, IN is west of
        Dortches, NC." at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dortches, NC is farther east
        than Cayuga, IN, indicating a difference in their longitudinal positions.
        The model mentions that NC cities like Dortches have smaller west longitudes
        than IN cities like Cayuga, which is why it concludes with NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response. The model concludes that Cayuga, IN is
        not east of Dortches, NC because Dortches is east of Cayuga.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Cayuga, IN is west of Dortches, NC,
        indicating a directional difference. The model specifically states "Indiana's
        easternmost point is just west of NC's westernmost point" and "Cayuga, IN
        is west of Dortches, NC." The model is asserting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the initial response and in the conclusion of its explanation. The
        model is making a comparative judgment that Cayuga, IN is not located east
        of Dortches, NC.
