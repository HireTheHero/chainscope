      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK (95\xB0W) is farther\
        \ west than Old Miakka, FL (82.5\xB0W), indicating a clear difference in longitude\
        \ values. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Turley, OK is east of Old Miakka, FL. The answer is direct and
        unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
