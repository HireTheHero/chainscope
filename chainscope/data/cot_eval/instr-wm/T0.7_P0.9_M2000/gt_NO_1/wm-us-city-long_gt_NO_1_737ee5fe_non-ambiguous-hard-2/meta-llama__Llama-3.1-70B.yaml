        The model states "Since Indiana is generally west of North Carolina, and Cayuga
        is in the western part of Indiana, it is west of Dortches, NC, which is in

        Mesa, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The model's
        reasoning is that "Running Springs, CA, is west of Red Mesa, AZ, which directly

        US. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Garden Prairie, IL is located east of Coal Grove, OH. The model
        provides reasoning about the relative positions of Illinois and Ohio, concluding
        that Garden Prairie would be west (not east) of Coal Grove.

        Leawood, KS is west of Chackbay, LA, not east of it. The model explains that
        "Kansas is generally west of Louisiana" and therefore "a city in Kansas (even
        in its eastern part) would typically be west of a city in Louisiana." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
