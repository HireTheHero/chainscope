      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga is west of
        Dortches ("Cayuga's longitude is likely west of Dortches" and "Indiana generally
        lies to the west of North Carolina"). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to whether Cayuga, IN is located east of Dortches,
        NC. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different (-87.5 for
        Cayuga and -77.8 for Dortches) and concludes that "Cayuga is located west
        of Dortches" based on this difference. The NO answer is given because Cayuga
        is west of Dortches, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        The NO answer is based on the locations being different (one west of the other),
        not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Old Miakka is situated further
        east than Turley" and concludes that "Turley is not east of Old Miakka." The
        model is indicating a difference in east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Turley, OK is located east of Old Miakka, FL. The model explicitly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. It clearly indicates that Turley, OK is NOT
        located east of Old Miakka, FL based on comparing their longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Oklahoma generally has a
        western longitude compared to Florida" and concludes that "Turley is not east
        of Old Miakka." The model is indicating a difference in longitude (Turley
        being west of Old Miakka), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Turley, OK is not located
        east of Old Miakka, FL" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Turley (in Oklahoma)
        is situated north and slightly west of Old Miakka (in Florida)" and "Since
        Turley is northwest of Old Miakka, it cannot be considered east of it." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (northwest vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to the question is: **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question of whether Turley, OK is located east of Old Miakka,
        FL.'
