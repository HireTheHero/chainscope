      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cayuga, IN, is
        west of Dortches, NC, not east" and explains that "Indiana (where Cayuga is
        located) is west of North Carolina (where Dortches is located)". The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer to whether Cayuga, IN, is located east of Dortches, NC, is: **NO**."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Indiana is west of North Carolina" and therefore "Cayuga, IN,
        would be west of Dortches, NC." The model is saying NO because it believes
        one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Cayuga, IN, is located east of Dortches, NC, is NO" in its conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indiana is west
        of North Carolina" and "any location in Indiana (like Cayuga) would be west
        of any location in North Carolina (like Dortches)." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer to whether Cayuga, IN, is located east of Dortches, NC, is: **NO**."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga, IN is west
        of Dortches, NC, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model concludes that North Carolina's longitudes are "generally more eastern
        (less negative) than Indiana's" and that "Cayuga, IN (being in Indiana) is
        generally west of Dortches, NC (being in North Carolina)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cayuga, IN is located east of Dortches, NC. The model concludes
        that "Cayuga, IN (being in Indiana) is generally west of Dortches, NC (being
        in North Carolina)" and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        Cayuga is east of Dortches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cayuga, IN would be west
        (and north) of Dortches, NC, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        west of North Carolina (where Dortches is located)" and "any location in Indiana
        would be west of any location in North Carolina." The model is indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cayuga, IN is not
        east of Dortches, NC; it is west." The NO answer is based on the locations
        being in different positions (west vs east), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating that Cayuga, IN is not east of
        Dortches, NC. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.'

        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, concluding that "Cayuga, IN, would be west of Dortches, NC, not
        east." The model is rejecting the premise that Cayuga is east of Dortches
        by stating they have different relative positions (one is west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        states "Cayuga, IN, would be west of Dortches, NC, not east" as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga, IN is west
        of Dortches, NC (indicating a difference in longitude). The model says "NO"
        because it determined that Cayuga is west of Dortches, not because they have
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cayuga, IN is located east of Dortches, NC. The model concludes
        that "Cayuga, IN, is west of Dortches, NC" and therefore answers "NO" to the
        question of whether Cayuga is east of Dortches.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Deadwood is not east of Simonton
        because Deadwood is "north and possibly slightly west of Simonton, TX, rather
        than east." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that Portageville, MO is
        west of Quentin, PA (indicating a difference in location). The model stated
        that "Pennsylvania (where Quentin is located) is east of Missouri (where Portageville
        is located)" which means the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concluded that "Portageville, MO, is
        west of Quentin, PA" and therefore answered "NO" to the original comparative
        question.

        will be west of any city in Pennsylvania (like Quentin)." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Portageville, MO, is located east of Quentin, PA, is NO" in its conclusion.

        is east of California (where Fairmead is), indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Silver Ridge, NJ is "both
        north and slightly east of Spring Hill, FL" due to the curvature of the coastline.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Silver Ridge being slightly
        east of Spring Hill), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arizona is generally

        for the NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
