      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga is west of
        Dortches, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cayuga, IN is not
        located east of Dortches, NC. It is located west of Dortches, NC." This is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fortuna is west
        of Bozeman, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model says "Fortuna must be west of Bozeman" and "It's located west of
        Bozeman," which clearly indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fortuna, CA is located east of Bozeman, MT. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that The Meadows, FL is "most
        likely WEST of Montandon, PA" - indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It first says "NO" after step 4, then reconsiders, but ultimately concludes

        its answer to "YES" after reconsidering. However, in the final statement,
        it contradicts itself by saying "The Meadows, FL is located east of Montandon,
        PA" which doesn't match its "YES" answer to whether The Meadows is west of
        Montandon. This creates confusion about what the final answer actually is,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that Crittenden, KY is west of Spackenkill, NY (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Crittenden, KY must be west of Spackenkill, NY, not east of it" as
        the reason for its NO answer. It did not claim the locations have equal longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes that Crittenden,
        KY is not east of Spackenkill, NY, but rather west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lakota, ND is located
        west of Rockwell City, IA, indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of
        the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lakota, ND is not located
        east of Rockwell City, IA. It is located west of it." This is an explicit
