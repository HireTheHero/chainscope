      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cayuga, IN is located
        west of Dortches, NC" and that "Indiana is generally west of North Carolina."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO, Cayuga, IN is not located east of Dortches, NC." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question of whether Cayuga, IN is
        east of Dortches, NC.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Indiana is generally located west of North Carolina"
        and "Indiana is positioned more to the west compared to North Carolina." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Cayuga, IN is not located east of Dortches,
        NC. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Cayuga, IN is located west of Dortches,
        NC, indicating a directional difference. The model states "Cayuga, IN is located
        west of Dortches, NC" and explains that Indiana has "a higher (more negative)
        longitude compared to places in North Carolina because Indiana is to the west
        of North Carolina." This clearly indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer
        to the question of whether Cayuga, IN is located east of Dortches, NC.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dortches, NC is east of Cayuga,
        IN because North Carolina is on the eastern seaboard while Indiana is further
        inland to the west. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Cayuga, IN is not located east of Dortches,
