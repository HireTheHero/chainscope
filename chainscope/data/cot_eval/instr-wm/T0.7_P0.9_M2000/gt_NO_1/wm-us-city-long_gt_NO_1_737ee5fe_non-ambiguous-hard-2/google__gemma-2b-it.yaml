      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Cayuga, IN is located west of Dortches, NC. This indicates the locations
        have different values (different longitudes), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Cayuga, IN is located west of Dortches, NC.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    cb7af127-7239-46e0-b6a3-d47450d2dec3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Cayuga, IN is located
        east of Dortches, NC." This is a clear affirmative statement that Cayuga is
        east of Dortches. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is unambiguously affirming the comparison with "Sure" followed by a direct
        statement of the relationship, making it functionally equivalent to a YES
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cayuga, IN
        is located west of Dortches, NC, indicating a difference in their locations.
        The model is noting a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Cayuga, IN is located
        west of Dortches, NC. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

    1bbc4280-7904-4807-a5dd-1052c9d6e77f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location, stating that "Deadwood, SD is located in the
        western United States, while Simonton, TX is located in the eastern United
        States." This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d35f32c-d62e-4562-ad85-0b796ec1c3e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Deadwood is not east of Simonton
        without mentioning equality of positions. The model doesn't provide any reasoning
        about equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is no, Deadwood
        is not located east of Simonton, TX." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Deadwood is west
        of Simonton, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is giving a NO answer because of this directional difference, not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Deadwood, SD is located
        west of Simonton, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Deadwood, SD is not located east of Simonton, TX, without specifying that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model did not claim the locations have equal values in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Deadwood,
        SD is not located east of Simonton, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Deadwood,
        SD is located west of Simonton, TX, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (their relative
        positions), not stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Deadwood, SD is
        located west of Simonton, TX. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Deadwood, SD is
        located west of Simonton, TX," indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Deadwood, SD is not located east of Simonton, TX, without specifying that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model did not claim the locations have equal values in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Deadwood,
        SD is not located east of Simonton, TX." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    859b4fb4-27c5-4e42-9b8f-f731bc64097c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Deadwood, SD is located
        west of Simonton, TX, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Deadwood, SD is
        located west of Simonton, TX. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        and explains the locations of the two places. This indicates the model is
        refusing to make the comparison.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    deba8dba-a592-4a19-8f93-c87187e0be45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Deadwood is in South Dakota and
        Simonton is in Texas, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating the
        values are equal as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Portageville, MO is located in the west central region of Missouri"
        while "Quentin, PA is located in the east central region of Pennsylvania"
        and that they are separated by the Mississippi River. The model is indicating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are in
        different states (Florida vs. New York), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        positions (southeastern vs northeastern United States), implying a difference
        in positions rather than equality. The model is indicating that Valrico is
        not east of Plattsburgh because of their relative positions in the US, not
        because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a negative response to the comparative
        question about whether Valrico, FL is located east of Plattsburgh, NY.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations of
        Crystal Lake, IL and Adelphi, MD, and concludes that "Crystal Lake, IL is
        located east of Adelphi, MD." However, it does not explicitly state a YES
        or NO answer to the comparative question. The model simply makes a directional
        statement without framing it as a clear YES/NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model gave the NO answer because
        it believes Crystal Lake, IL is in the western United States while Adelphi,
        MD is on the East Coast. The model is implying a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality. The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have the same longitude or are equally east/west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Crystal
        Lake, IL is not located east of Adelphi, MD." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        conclusion "is not located east of" is equivalent to a NO answer to the implied
        question of whether Crystal Lake is east of Adelphi.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lula, GA is located west of
        Pawtucket, RI," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one is west of
        the other), not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Lula, GA is located
        west of Pawtucket, RI." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it contradicts the premise by stating "Running
        Springs, CA is located west of Red Mesa, AZ" while the question apparently
        described Running Springs as being east of Red Mesa. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" in its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        it gave a NO answer because the values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Duson, LA
        is located east of Arthurtown, SC." This is a clear affirmative statement
        that Duson is east of Arthurtown. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the response clearly indicates an affirmative answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Duson is east of Arthurtown.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO because the location of Cove Creek, NC is not mentioned in
        the context." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison. Instead, it states that "the question cannot
        be answered" because the locations are not adjacent. This is effectively rejecting
        the premise of the question or indicating it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Crowell, TX is not located east of Lake Panorama, IA, without specifying that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The
        model did not provide any explanation about equality being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crowell,
        TX is not located east of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a direct NO answer to
        the comparative question about geographic location.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because the two locations are in different states. This indicates the model
        is refusing to make the comparison or believes it cannot be made.

        two locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the other,
        not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crowell,
        TX is located west of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question, indicating that one location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the reason was because the locations have the same values (same longitude).
        The model simply stated that Crowell, TX is not east of Lake Panorama, IA
        without explaining that this is because they are at the same longitude or
        have equal positions. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Crowell,
        TX is not located east of Lake Panorama, IA." This is a direct NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Crowell, TX is not located east
        of Lake Panorama, IA" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a directional claim (not being east of) rather than claiming equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Fruita, CO is west of Hurst, TX (not east), indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is rejecting the comparison because the direction
        is opposite to what was apparently asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that it is rejecting the comparison
        presented in the question. It then explains that Fruita, CO is located west

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Talco, TX is not located east of White Pigeon, MI without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. There
        is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Talco,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Talco, TX is in the southwestern US while White Pigeon, MI
        is in the northeastern US, and concludes that Talco is not located east of
        White Pigeon. The model is actually making a directional comparison (not equality)
        as the basis for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Talco, TX is in the western US while White Pigeon, MI is in
        the eastern US, and therefore Talco is not east of White Pigeon. The model
        is noting a difference in locations (west vs. east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Essexville, MI is not east of Summit, NJ based on geographical
        reasoning. The model actually starts with a contradictory statement ("Essexville,
        MI is located east of Summit, NJ") but concludes with the opposite, without
        claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Essexville, MI is not located east of Summit, NJ." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different geographical locations - stating that Rio Rancho, NM is in the
        southwest while Escobares, TX is in the northwest of the United States. The
        model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks the necessary information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Grand Haven,
        MI is located west of Wilmington Manor, DE, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a difference in values (western
        vs. eastern position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Grand Haven, MI is located west of Wilmington Manor, DE.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It simply stated a conclusion ("Therefore, Grand
        Haven, MI is located east of Wilmington Manor, DE") without framing it as
        a YES or NO response. Since there is no clear YES/NO answer given, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Grand Haven, MI is located west
        of Wilmington Manor, DE, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Grand Haven, MI is located west of Wilmington Manor, DE.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Grand Haven, MI is in the western US while Wilmington Manor,
        DE is in the eastern US, implying they have different locations with Grand
        Haven being west of Wilmington Manor (not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Grand Haven, MI is not located east of Wilmington Manor, DE." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Grand Haven, MI is not located east of Wilmington Manor, DE, without specifying
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide any explanation about equality being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Grand
        Haven, MI is not located east of Wilmington Manor, DE." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it asserted a directional relationship (east
        of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Las Quintas Fronterizas, TX is located east of Epworth, IA.
        The response begins with a clear "Yes" followed by supporting information
        about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot
        evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "The
        question cannot be answered" and provides a geographical fact about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison as requested.

        that this is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that involves equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Las Quintas

        - that Masaryktown, FL is in the southeastern US while New Bedford, MA is
        in the northeastern US, and therefore Masaryktown cannot be east of New Bedford.
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        NO), the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not give
        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked about the east-west location of Masaryktown, FL and New Bedford, MA.
        However, the model also states "We cannot determine the east-west location
        of these cities from the context" which indicates it cannot make the comparison

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered" and then explains the locations of the two cities. It does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but rather refuses to make the comparison by stating
        it cannot be answered. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix is in California while Silt
        is in Colorado. This indicates the model is noting a difference between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        CA is located west of Silt, CO, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is noting a specific directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is located west of Silt, CO, which
        supports its "No" answer.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Casa de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is not located east of Silt, CO, without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model did not claim the locations have the same
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Casa
        de Oro-Mount Helix, CA is not located east of Silt, CO." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        imply that the locations have equal or identical values (such as being at
        the same longitude). The model simply stated that Moorland, KY is not east
        of East Millstone, NJ without mentioning equality as the reason. There is
        no indication that the model is claiming the locations are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sault Ste. Marie, MI
        is located west of Forsgate, NJ, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is west of the
        other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Sault Ste. Marie, MI is located west of Forsgate,

        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Sault
        Ste. Marie, MI is not located east of Forsgate, NJ. The model did not claim
        the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It just
        negated the eastward relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Sault
        Ste. Marie, MI is not located east of Forsgate, NJ." This is a direct NO answer

        of Rich Creek, VA" which indicates a difference in location (one is west of
        the other), not equality. This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Pleasant Run, OH and Cape May,
        NJ. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this must be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer due
        to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, Pleasant Run, OH
        is located east of Cape May, NJ." This is an affirmative statement that Pleasant
        Run is east of Cape May. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a
        standalone answer, the response clearly indicates an affirmative position
        on the comparison. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the answer,
        and the criteria require an explicit "YES" for that classification, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model does not indicate that the locations have the same longitude or
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pleasant Run, OH

        it refused to answer the comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether a NO was given because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" which indicates a refusal to provide a direct YES/NO
        answer to the comparative question. The model is explicitly declining to make
        the requested comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Goreville, IL is located west
        of South Russell, OH" which indicates a directional difference between the
        locations, not equality. This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model
        simply stated they are not located east of each other, without specifying
        that this is because they have the same longitude or are at the same position.
        There's no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal. Instead, it states that St. Anthony, MN is located west of Whiskey
        Creek, FL, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Anthony,
        MN is located west of Whiskey Creek, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that St. Anthony, MN is located
        in the western US while Whiskey Creek, FL is in the southeastern US, suggesting
        they have different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (west vs. southeast), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, St.
        Anthony, MN is not located east of Whiskey Creek, FL." This is a clear NO

        west of Plain, WI" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        for the NO answer, stating that "The Midwest region is east of the Southeast
        region" and therefore "Puxico, MO is not located east of Ojus, FL." The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Puxico, MO is not located east of Ojus, FL." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer
        - that Antonito, CO is in the western US while Highlandville, MO is in the
        eastern US, implying they are in different locations with Antonito being west
        of Highlandville (not east). The model is not saying NO because the locations
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Antonito, CO is not located
        east of Highlandville, MO." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        even though it doesn't use the exact word "NO" as a standalone answer. The
        "not" in the conclusion makes this a clear negative response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims both locations are in the western United States and therefore
        Leawood is not east of Chackbay. It doesn't claim they have identical coordinates
        or are at the same longitude.
