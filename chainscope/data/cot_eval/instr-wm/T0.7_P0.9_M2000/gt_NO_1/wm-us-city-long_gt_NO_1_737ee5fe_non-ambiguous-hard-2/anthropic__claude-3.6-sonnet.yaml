      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that North Carolina is further east
        than Indiana, and therefore Dortches, NC is east of Cayuga, IN. The model
        gives directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cayuga is west of Dortches, not east. The model explicitly states "Indiana
        is clearly west of North Carolina" and "Cayuga must be west of Dortches,"
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Cayuga is east of Dortches. The model determined
        that Cayuga is west of Dortches, not east, and therefore answered NO to the
        original question.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Portageville,
        MO is west of Quentin, PA, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The model is saying NO because the relationship is the opposite
        of what was apparently asked (whether Portageville is east of Quentin).

        "Louisiana is significantly further west" and "Any city in South Carolina
        will be east of any city in Louisiana." The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Old Miakka is east of Turley
        (not that they have the same longitude). The model specifically notes that
        "All of Florida is east of all of Oklahoma" and concludes that Old Miakka
        must be east of Turley, which is why Turley is not east of Old Miakka.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Turley is not east
        of Old Miakka)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida is significantly east
        of Oklahoma" and "Old Miakka, FL is east of Turley, OK," indicating a clear
        directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question of whether Turley, OK is east of Old Miakka, FL.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Turley, OK is WEST
        of Old Miakka, FL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Turley, OK is
        not east of Old Miakka, FL, but rather is west of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Turley is west of Old Miakka
        (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        Turley, OK is east of Old Miakka, FL.
