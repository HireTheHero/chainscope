        to the question of whether Portageville is east of Quentin. The model makes
        a definitive comparative judgment after analyzing the locations.

        positions (with Knightsville being west of Bantam).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        its reasoning, as the model concluded in step 4 that "Knightsville, IN is

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" because it cannot locate Arthurtown, SC
        and therefore cannot determine the relationship between the two locations.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Antonito is west of Highlandville (not east as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "Antonito is west of Highlandville" and "Highlandville
        is east of Antonito" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Antonito, CO located east of Highlandville, MO?" The model
        explains that Antonito is west of Highlandville, and therefore not east of
        it, concluding with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.
