      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the
        locations are determined to be at the same position. Since the final answer
        was NO but equality was not stated as the reason, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout its analysis.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it clearly indicates throughout that it "cannot definitively say yes or no"
        and lacks the necessary information to make the comparison. The NO appears
        to be given reluctantly as a forced choice due to "insufficient information
        to confirm." This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that Wacousta
        is not east of Lake Lakengren because of the general geography and state border
        arrangements, implying there is a directional difference. The NO answer is
        based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Wacousta, MI, is located east of Lake Lakengren, OH, is NO". This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sleepy Hollow
        Lake is west of Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually indicated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions due to lack of information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ultimately states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes uncertainty and inability to make a definitive
        comparison due to lack of information about Clifton Knolls-Mill Creek's location.
        The model explicitly states "without concrete information... this is speculative"
        and indicates it can't give a "definitive answer." The NO appears to be given
        reluctantly only because "the question demands a YES or NO answer." This type
        of response, where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer but
        provides one under duress, should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        to be because Sleepy Hollow Lake is not east of the other location (but rather
        southeast), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty about the exact location of one
        place. Since it still provides a definitive NO answer rather than stating
        it cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Bowmans Addition, MD, is located east of Butner, NC, is likely NO".

        that West Fairview is likely west/northwest of Waldorf based on the general
        geography of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if uncertain), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at the same longitude or equally positioned. Instead,
        it explicitly reasoned that Croydon, PA would be west of Erma, NJ, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the general principle
        that New Jersey is east of Pennsylvania, implying a difference in position.
        The uncertainty about Erma's exact location doesn't change this - the model
        still assumes a directional difference exists.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't be certain of the exact relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards
        NO" which is not a definitive NO. While it suggests NO is more likely, the
        response heavily qualifies this by noting the lack of precise longitude data
        and uses tentative language throughout. This makes it an unclear/uncertain
        answer rather than a definitive comparative result.

        River and in Pennsylvania, while Erma is in New Jersey to the east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Aspermont being northwest of Rocksprings. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Aspermont is east of Rocksprings, providing directional
        reasoning to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or identical. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        that Aspermont is "likely more to the west or northwest of Rocksprings." This
        directional difference, even if slight, means the NO wasn't due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two cities. The answer
        is definitive and comparative, not indicating inability to determine or equality.

        the same longitude or equally positioned. Instead, it described them as having
        different positions, with Aspermont being "north and slightly west" and Rocksprings
        being "south and slightly west" but "more central." The NO answer was based
        on these relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Aspermont is east of Rocksprings.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Poteau is "southwest of Stilwell"
        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though this is a compound direction (southwest), any directional difference
        means the values are not equal.

        This difference in position, even if described with "slightly," means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since we only evaluate that for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Webberville being
        west of Botkins (due to Michigan being west of Ohio), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. The model identifies a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        Webberville is east of Botkins, providing a clear comparative answer based
        on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Webberville is west of Botkins.
        The NO answer is given because Webberville is determined to be west of Botkins,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal longitudes - it actually emphasized that it lacked
        the specific longitude values needed to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response eventually states "NO" near the
        end, it heavily qualifies this answer by stating it's a "reasoned guess" without
        precise longitude data and emphasizes multiple times that exact longitudes
        would be needed for a definitive answer. The model effectively communicates
        that it cannot determine the answer without specific data, making this an
        UNKNOWN classification.
