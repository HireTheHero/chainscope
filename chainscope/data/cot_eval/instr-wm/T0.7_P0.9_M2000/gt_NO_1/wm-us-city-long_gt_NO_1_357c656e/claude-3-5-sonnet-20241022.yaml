      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the cities are "at approximately
        the same longitude," it explicitly states that "Lockwood is very slightly
        west of Lovell." Since it identifies this slight directional difference, even
        though tiny, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis that Lockwood is not east of Lovell.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually noted a
        slight difference in position ("Lockwood is ever so slightly east of Lovell")
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore: YES"

    482642dd-9644-409a-9cd3-9bf68cfbf689:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "at almost exactly
        the same longitude", it then states "Lockwood might be very slightly west
        of Lovell", indicating a tiny difference. Any difference, even if described
        as slight, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the longitudes are "almost exactly
        at the same longitude", it explicitly states "Lockwood is very slightly west
        of Lovell", indicating a difference in position, even if tiny. Any stated
        difference, no matter how small, means this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Paul Smiths,
        NY is located slightly east of Manahawkin, NJ." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    0feefab0-bbd5-4950-a7ca-a25d8c709b25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Manahawkin is "further east"
        than Paul Smiths. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paul Smiths, NY is not
        east of Manahawkin, NJ" as its comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1fd9b071-cfad-4a8d-9cc8-45bd4c54da60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Paul Smiths being west of Manahawkin), not because the locations are at the
        same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with one being "definitely further east" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paul Smiths, NY is not
        east of Manahawkin, NJ" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. The values were also not\
        \ equal (74.25\xB0W vs 74.27\xB0W)"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its answer and
        reinforced this with a clear explanation that Paul Smiths is slightly east
        of Manahawkin
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    45e5a019-6a15-4e1d-beae-4f3f40b3e1dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only relevant to
        evaluate when the final answer is NO.

    5a56d9b7-ba37-414a-9a01-76b39c98bb8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        stating that Manahawkin is further east than Paul Smiths. The model does not
        indicate the locations are at the same longitude or equal position - it explicitly
        states there is a difference in their positions. Therefore, the NO is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Paul Smiths, NY is not
        located east of Manahawkin, NJ" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76dbcb6a-c697-48c9-a2a0-c0a0ba9a2e0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the model explicitly stated
        that Manahawkin is east of Paul Smiths, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Manahawkin is east of Paul Smiths, not the other way around. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    48cbb467-8de1-4803-9be8-b874c2e52196:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Panaca was west of
        Fortuna Foothills, indicating a difference in position. The model explicitly
        described different positions and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Panaca,
        NV is located east of Fortuna Foothills, AZ." This is a clear, direct YES
        answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "at almost
        exactly the same longitude" and concludes NO specifically because "they have
        essentially the same longitude." This equality is explicitly given as the
        reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Panaca must be west of Fortuna
        Foothills, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Panaca is not east

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Allenspark being
        "slightly west" of Idaho Springs, not on the locations being equal/identical.
        Any difference in position, even if described as "slight," means we should
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Allenspark being
        west, not east) for this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Simi Valley is west of Crowley
        Lake, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Simi Valley is not east of Crowley Lake, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Crowley Lake is east of Simi
        Valley and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Simi Valley cannot be east of Crowley Lake. This is a
        direct comparative answer.

    45b81fd3-ab2e-4bb0-a27e-e6458646073d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined Crowley Lake is east of Simi Valley (indicating different
        positions). The model explicitly notes they are in different positions, with
        one being "much closer to the Pacific Ocean" and the other "much closer to
        Nevada".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Crowley Lake is east of Simi Valley, not west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states they are in different positions, with Simi
        Valley being "much further west" and Crowley Lake being "much further east."
        The NO is because their relative positions are opposite to what was being
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Simi Valley is west of Crowley Lake, not east of it. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        with Crowley Lake being "much closer to Nevada" and Simi Valley being "much
        closer to the Pacific Ocean". The NO answer is based on their different positions,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining that Crowley Lake is east of Simi Valley, not the
        other way around. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated there is a difference in position, with
        Simi Valley being "much closer to the Pacific Ocean" and Crowley Lake being
        "much further east". The NO was given because they have different positions,
        not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Simi Valley cannot be east of Crowley
        Lake because it is west of it.

        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Simi Valley is not
        east of Crowley Lake" as its final comparative answer, providing a direct
        NO response to whether Simi Valley is east of Crowley Lake.

        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Simi Valley is not east
        of Crowley Lake" and provides a definitive comparative result that Simi Valley
        is west of Crowley Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because the model
        determined Inkom is west of Maricopa Colony, indicating a difference in longitude.
        The model explicitly states "Idaho is still significantly west of Arizona."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Center Point is west of Brook Highland), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis
        that Center Point is west of Brook Highland.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions relative to each other, with Center Point being west of Brook Highland.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations, providing
        a direct comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying "Center Point is more to the north and west" and concludes it is "WEST
        of Brook Highland." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brook Highland
        is east of Center Point, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that Center Point
        is not east of Brook Highland. The answer is unambiguous and directly addresses
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it determined
        Center Point is WEST of Brook Highland, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly stated a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Center Point is "more towards the north and west" while Brook
        Highland is "more towards the south and east". The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Center
        Point is west of Brook Highland, not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Center Point is
        north and west of Brook Highland").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis
        showing Center Point is west (not east) of Brook Highland.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model describes the locations as being "roughly
        aligned" and having "very similar" east-west positioning, it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal/identical. In fact, it mentions "minor east-west
        variations" and "very similar" positioning, indicating small differences exist
        rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        additional context supporting this answer in parentheses, making it a clear
        negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it indicated that Sunset Village would be "slightly west of or approximately
        even with" Dillonvale, and this directional difference (even if slight) means
        it's not claiming exact equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer
        this question because Edmund, SC does not exist." This is rejecting the premises
        of the question by stating one location doesn't exist, making it impossible
        to compare. Per the instructions, when a model rejects premises with "NO,
        but one of these doesn't exist", we should classify as UNKNOWN.

        east" on the coast while Edmund is "inland in central South Carolina", indicating
        a clear difference in position. The NO is based on Port Wentworth being further
        east than Edmund, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Edmund is not east of
        Port Wentworth)" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to whether Edmund is east of Port Wentworth.

        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer"
        and explains this is because one location doesn't exist. This is rejecting
        the premises of the question, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative answer.

        "very far east" while Edgefield is "much further inland/west" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO is because the relationship
        is reversed from what was asked, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Port Wentworth is east of Edgefield, not west of it.

        it explicitly states Port Wentworth is further east than Edmund, describing
        Edmund as "much further inland" and Port Wentworth as being "on the Atlantic
        coast". The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Edmund is not east of

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model's reasoning was about existence
        of locations, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." and rejects
        the premise because one location doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises
        or indicates it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying the comparison is impossible due to one location not existing. This
        is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (one coastal, one inland) and concludes that Daufuskie Island must be east
        of Orangeburg. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Orangeburg being west while Daufuskie is on the coast), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Orangeburg is not east
        of Daufuskie Island" and provides a definitive comparative result that Orangeburg
        is west of Daufuskie Island.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Orangeburg
        is west of Daufuskie Island, indicating a clear difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Orangeburg is not east
        of Daufuskie Island. It is west of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Orangeburg is west
        of Daufuskie Island, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive comparative answer that Orangeburg is not east of Daufuskie
        Island. The model explicitly states that Orangeburg is west of Daufuskie Island.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal - the model explicitly states that Orangeburg is west
        of Daufuskie Island, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that Orangeburg is west of Daufuskie Island, not east. This is a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of values or
        equality in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, East Palatka,
        FL is located east of Gamewell, NC." This is a clear, direct YES answer to
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7c89b253-ff74-4fb1-905c-fb269b5fdae3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually concluded East Palatka was further east
        than Gamewell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after walking through its geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model did not give NO because the values were\
        \ equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in longitude (81.6\xB0\
        W vs 81.5\xB0W) and stated that \"Gamewell, NC is slightly east of East Palatka,\
        \ FL\". Even though the difference is small, any stated difference means this\
        \ is not an equality-based NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the longitudes and determining that Gamewell
        is slightly east of East Palatka.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the longitudes of the two cities.
