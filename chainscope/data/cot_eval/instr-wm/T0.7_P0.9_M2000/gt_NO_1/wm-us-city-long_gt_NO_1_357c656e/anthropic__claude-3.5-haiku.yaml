      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lockwood is west of Lovell, indicating a directional difference between their
        positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after working through the relative positions and
        concluding that Lockwood is west of Lovell (not east).

    535ba8c8-4874-4f89-b55b-ceb3fb860174:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lockwood is actually west
        of Lovell" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on relative positions. The answer
        is definitive and explicitly stated.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Panaca is west
        of Fortuna Foothills, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The model notes they are "quite far apart" and in "different states."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that Panaca is west of Fortuna Foothills and
        they are in different parts of the Southwest. The NO answer was given because
        Panaca is west (not east) of Fortuna Foothills.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Panaca is
        west of Fortuna Foothills, indicating a difference in position. The NO is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Panaca
        is west of Fortuna Foothills, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on the opposite direction being true, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that Panaca is NOT east of
        Fortuna Foothills. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't verify one location
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to uncertainty about one location's existence/position. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot verify the location to make the comparison. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" or
        make a "definitive geographic determination" and while it provides "NO" as
        a default answer, it clearly indicates this is due to insufficient information
        rather than an actual comparative result. This matches the criteria for UNKNOWN
        - where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        difference (Wacousta being north/northwest of Lake Lakengren). The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Crowley Lake is much further
        east than Simi Valley" and concludes that "Simi Valley is west of Crowley
        Lake". The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Simi Valley, CA is
        NOT located east of Crowley Lake, CA" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Crowley Lake is east of Simi Valley, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Crowley Lake
        is east of Simi Valley (rather than Simi Valley being east of Crowley Lake).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states that Simi
        Valley is "west of Crowley Lake" and that Crowley Lake is "northeast of Simi
        Valley", indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Simi Valley is not east of Crowley Lake, but rather
        west of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Simi
        Valley is "significantly south and west of Crowley Lake" - it explicitly notes
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO is because the locations are
        different, not because they are the same.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Hodgkins
        was explicitly stated to be west of Spanish Fort, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        Spanish Fort and gives this directional difference as the reason for the NO
        answer, not because they are at the same location.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that McHenry
        is northwest of Carpentersville, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and provides a clear comparative reasoning that
        McHenry is northwest of Carpentersville, therefore it is NOT east of it.

        difference (Solana being west of Willow Oak), not because the locations are

        any directional difference means the values are not equal.

        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and explains
        it cannot make the determination due to uncertainty about the locations. This

        a difference in location, not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Sleepy Hollow Lake is east of Clifton Knolls-Mill

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Allison
        Park was determined to be northwest of Pleasant Hills, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states a directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        determines Allison Park is west of Pleasant Hills (a directional difference).
        Even if this geographical reasoning might be incorrect, the model explicitly
        states a directional difference rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly states that Nisqually
        Indian Community is "northwest of Penngrove," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because one location
        is west (not east) of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The model determined that Nisqually Indian Community is northwest
        of Penngrove, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ad93eaeb-ebb5-4b86-8722-788c91d6a010:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it concludes NO because Nisqually Indian Community
        is determined to be west of (not east of) Penngrove, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a definitive
        NO answer.'

    d14da48e-fac9-488e-ac11-897bb4402c5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. Instead, the NO was based on the
        reasoning that since Washington is north of California, and both locations
        are in the western parts of their states, one cannot be east of the other.
        The model indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Nisqually Indian Community
        is NOT east of Penngrove.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Port Sanilac is "further
        west than Sarasota" and provides this directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Port Sanilac is NOT east of

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that East Providence is west of Millis-Clicquot, not east), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Aspermont
        was determined to be northwest of Rocksprings, indicating a different relative
        position. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("northwest
        of Rocksprings, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Aspermont
        is "north and slightly west of Rocksprings" - not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Aspermont
        is "northeast of Rocksprings" rather than directly east. This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality of positions. The model does not state
        or suggest the locations are equal or the same in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the answer.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states differences in position, noting
        that Aspermont is "further west" than Rocksprings. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "Aspermont is NOT east of Rocksprings." This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because Aspermont
        was explicitly stated to be northwest of Rocksprings, indicating a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        and describes them as being in different positions (western part vs northeastern
        part). The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carlls
        Corner is west of Raubsville (opposite of what was presumably asked), not
        because the locations have equal coordinates. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Carlls Corner is actually west of Raubsville").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5eb04cb6-ecd9-458f-aa26-cbd1f3b644c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do NOT KNOW" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to uncertainty about the locations. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        YES." at the end of its step-by-step analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Carlls
        Corner is west of Raubsville, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. It does not state that the locations are at the same coordinates
        or longitude. The NO is due to a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Carlls Corner
        is west of Raubsville (not east).'

    94a5f0ef-52aa-4b83-8c9f-4ccd97e1eb47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify the
        locations" and that its NO is "based on my inability to confirm the locations,
        not on a definitive geographic determination." This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
