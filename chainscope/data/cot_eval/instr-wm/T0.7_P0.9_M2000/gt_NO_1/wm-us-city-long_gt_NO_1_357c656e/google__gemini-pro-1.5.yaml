        Poquoson, not because the locations are equal/same. It explicitly states a
        directional difference ("Hampton is to the west of Poquoson"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that it cannot make the determination due to needing more specific location
        information. Since this indicates an inability to determine the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explained that Neah Bay would be west of Port Orford
        due to Washington being west of Oregon, and confirmed this even after considering
        coastal curvature. The NO answer was based on a difference in position, not
        equality.

        "Inkom may be slightly east." Any mention of a difference, even if described
        as slight, means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that Inkom, ID is not significantly east of Maricopa
        Colony, AZ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Inkom, ID "should be west of" Maricopa Colony, AZ. The NO
        answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it indicated there was
        a directional difference (Idaho being west of Arizona) before inexplicably
        concluding NO. The NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, which contradicts its
        own reasoning that suggested Idaho would be west of Arizona.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were determined to be at the same longitude. Instead, the NO
        was based on the model's determination that Washington is "significantly west"
        of California, indicating a clear difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Washington is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Beckemeyer would likely be east of
        Rhinelander based on the relative positions of Illinois and Wisconsin, and
        still arrived at NO. This indicates the NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on their relative
        positions being different (IL being west of WI). Since it indicates a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative directional reasoning for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that The Homesteads
        is west of Wynnewood, indicating a difference in longitude. The NO answer
        was given because The Homesteads is west (not east) of Wynnewood.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Beemer would be west of Prosper, indicating
        a difference in longitude. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are at equal
        positions - in fact, it explicitly states that McHenry is northwest of Carpentersville,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on McHenry
        being northwest of Carpentersville, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning steps leading to that conclusion based on McHenry
        being northwest of Carpentersville.

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly noted that McHenry appears to be northwest
        of Carpentersville, indicating a difference in position. This directional
        difference, not equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The answer
        was given directly after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are at equal
        positions - instead, it explicitly states that McHenry is "more north and
        west than Carpentersville" and uses this difference in position to conclude
        NO. The NO answer is based on McHenry being west (not east) of Carpentersville,
        not because of equal positions.

        that "McHenry is more north/northwest of Carpentersville." Even though this
        is not strictly east/west, any stated directional difference means we cannot
        classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        if small, means the NO answer was not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to a comparative question
        about location, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        a directional difference (California being west of Florida), not because the
        locations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a west-east difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        rather than purely east of Brook Highland, not because the locations are equal/same.
        It explicitly notes a directional difference (northeast vs southeast relative
        to Birmingham).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, after analyzing the directional relationship between the
        locations and determining that Center Point being northeast (not purely east)
        of Brook Highland means it is not directly east.

        the same. Instead, it noted that Center Point is "slightly north *and* east
        of Brook Highland" but concluded NO for other reasons (seemingly because the
        pure east-west comparison was being asked about). Since it noted a difference
        in position (even if slight), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

    0cb0ff10-f939-4aa4-82a7-127d20f77bdc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are at equal
        positions or coordinates. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO
        answer - that the cities have different positions relative to Pittsburgh (north
        vs south), making one not east of the other. Since the NO answer is not based
        on equality of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a standalone answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of the cities.

    bc5b9f04-0fd0-4ec0-a90b-14ce15137401:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Allison Park is not directly east of
        Pleasant Hills because of their north/south positioning, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude/position. Instead, it explicitly describes Allison Park
        as being west of Pleasant Hills, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    bf360107-c1dd-4ffe-b052-2d0c094ddddb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (north vs east), not because the locations have equal positions. The model
        explicitly states that "North is not east" and concludes that Allison Park
        is not east of Pleasant Hills because it's north instead.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Allison Park is north of Pleasant Hills, not east of
        it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c37dd500-f898-43cd-a3a4-51af5ad2e23b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it gave NO because Allison Park is north of Pleasant Hills rather
        than east. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Allison Park is
        not east of Pleasant Hills. It is north of Pleasant Hills.")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after explaining that Allison Park is north of Pleasant
        Hills rather than east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cadfe2c5-f2b8-437c-85c1-444c1700f0fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Allison Park is north of Pittsburgh
        while Pleasant Hills is south of Pittsburgh, indicating different positions.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result addressing the question
        about relative position.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f60cb570-f247-4e62-8fb7-a3cd7eb20e5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "any east/west difference
        is likely minimal," it does not state that the locations are at exactly the
        same east/west position. In fact, it suggests there might be slight east/west
        differences ("it might still be slightly east or west"). The NO answer is
        based on Allison Park being primarily north rather than east, not because
        of equal east/west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after explaining
        that Allison Park is primarily north, not east, of Pleasant Hills. This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe56d5fc-c0da-4e4d-98bb-bdf1432dda52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it actually states they are in different positions
        relative to Pittsburgh (Allison Park is "west of Pittsburgh" while Pleasant
        Hills is "east of Pittsburgh"). The NO appears to be based on their relative
        positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing directional reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted that Louisiana is "generally east of Iowa" -
        indicating a difference in position, and this difference appears to be the
        basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a clear, direct NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion because Louisiana is "generally
        west of Iowa" which contradicts the expected relationship. This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Oak
        Trail Shores is "considerably further west" than Santa Rita Ranch, not because
        the locations are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Oak Trail Shores is west of Santa Rita Ranch, making

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it determined that one location
        is northwest of the other, which directly contradicts them being equal. The
        NO answer was based on the directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Oak Trail Shores
        being west of Santa Rita Ranch, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Granbury is west of
        Liberty Hill"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to contradict its own reasoning - it concludes
        Urbancrest is "likely WEST" but then says "NO" without explaining why. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning,
        stating that "Ohio is generally west of Georgia" and therefore Urbancrest
        is not east of Bowersville. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it described them as being in different positions,
        with Daufuskie Island being on the eastern edge and Orangeburg being inland
        and west of Daufuskie. The NO answer was based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences
        (that Orangeburg is northwest, north, or northeast of Daufuskie Island), not
        because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states
        there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its analysis that Orangeburg
        is not directly east of Daufuskie Island.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Orangeburg is west of Daufuskie
        Island, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described a specific directional relationship, noting
        that Orangeburg is "inland and generally north and west" of the coastal islands.
        Since it indicated a directional difference, even if the difference might
        be small, this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning that Weston Lakes
        is west of Houston, which is west of Dallas, while Myrtle Springs is east
        of Dallas. The NO appears to be based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states that "Weston Lakes
        is further south and west," indicating a difference in position. Since it
        notes a directional difference (being "further west"), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Myrtle Springs being east of Dallas which is east of Houston, while Weston
        Lakes is west of Houston) rather than the locations being equal/same/identical.
        The model identifies a clear directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state or suggest that the locations
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there is a difference
        in location ("Mountain View Acres is west of Silver Lakes"). While the "NO"
        conclusion appears to contradict the reasoning, we must classify based on
        what was stated, and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. While the reasoning appears
        to contradict the conclusion (it states Mountain View Acres is west of Silver
        Lakes but then says NO), we must take the explicit final "NO" at face value
        per instructions.

        that the locations were at equal longitudes. In fact, it suggested there would
        be a difference in longitude due to geographic position, just reached a contradictory
        conclusion. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps, indicating that Nisqually Indian

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitude. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on reasoning that contradicted
        its conclusion - it actually argued that Nisqually would be west of Penngrove
        due to latitude differences, yet still concluded NO. While this is internally
        inconsistent, we must evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Metolius is southeast of Dallesport, not directly east). The model
        identifies a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical relationship between the two locations, determining
        that Metolius is southeast of Dallesport rather than directly east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at equal coordinates. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process about
        relative positions and concludes NO, contradicting its own reasoning about
        Colorado being west of Montana. While this may seem illogical, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, not what makes geographical sense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it determined that West Fairview is northwest of Waldorf,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7560f618-7604-4ab8-8ddb-0d94acb32beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated that West Fairview
        is "actually east of Waldorf," indicating a difference in longitude. The NO
        is based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that West Fairview
        is not west of Waldorf.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it concludes that West Fairview, PA is likely west
        of Waldorf, MD, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a345496c-6d39-437c-851c-576bc7ab86ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were determined to be at the same longitude. Instead, the model
        concluded NO because it determined West Fairview is west of Waldorf, indicating
        a difference in longitude. The model explicitly stated "Pennsylvania is generally
        west of Maryland" and concluded West Fairview is "likely west of Waldorf."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that West Fairview
        is not east of Waldorf (in fact stating the opposite - that West Fairview
        is likely west of Waldorf).

      result: 'NO'
    d477cfeb-d574-416c-8d74-76ae30f7b224:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the locations might be "closer"
        in longitude, it does not state they are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates
        there is still a difference, noting that West Fairview is likely west of Waldorf.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that West Fairview
        is not further east than Waldorf.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the longitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it made a directional comparison, stating that West
        Fairview is "likely west of" Waldorf, indicating a difference in longitude
        (even though this seems to contradict its "NO" conclusion).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that West Fairview is "likely
        west and north of Waldorf" and uses this directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east/west positions of the two locations, providing a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that one location is "north and west"
        of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (-76.69 vs -76.68) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The
        values are not equal or approximately equal, so this is not a case of equal
        values leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of the two locations, making this a clear comparative
        result.

    1f6e1721-a27a-4d8f-9d27-4b04bcaeea5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (-76.69 vs -76.68)
        and based its NO answer on -76.69 being less than -76.68, not on the values
        being equal. Even though the difference is small, any difference means this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitude values, making this a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-76.7 vs -76.6) and concludes Oriental is "further west."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes and determining Oriental is further
        west than Crofton.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives specific different longitude values\
        \ (76.7\xB0W vs 76.6\xB0W) and explicitly states that Oriental is west of\
        \ Crofton because of this difference. The NO answer is based on this difference\
        \ in values, not on them being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Oriental, NC is west of Crofton, MD (not east of it).
        This is a direct comparative answer to the implicit question of whether Oriental,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at approximately
        -76.7 degrees longitude" and "at approximately the same longitude," and this
        equality is the primary basis for the NO answer (since being at the same longitude
        means one cannot be east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it noted that North Bay Village is "slightly east" of Oakland
        Park but concluded NO for other reasons (being "significantly south" made
        it not "entirely east"). Since the model noted a difference in position (even
        if slight) and based its NO on other reasoning, this doesn't qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        longitude. Instead, it reasoned about relative positions, indicating that
        Brownsboro Farm is west of Gas City due to their positions within their respective
        states. The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis. While the reasoning includes words like "likely," the
        final answer is clearly stated as "NO".

        the locations being at the same longitude or having equal positions. It explicitly
        states a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison concluding that Boring, OR is not located
        east of North Richmond, CA.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Oregon is west of California, therefore Boring, OR cannot be east of
        North Richmond, CA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning steps about the relative locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (Oregon being north of California making it impossible for Boring to be directly
        east of North Richmond), not because the locations are at the same position
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Oregon is "much further
        west" than California and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The presence of a stated difference, even if incorrect, means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis. This appears to be a direct comparative
