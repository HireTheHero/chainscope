        of The Homesteads, TX is unclear)". The model did not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer, but instead indicated that it cannot make the comparison because
        the location of The Homesteads, TX is not definitive. This falls under the

        Hills. This indicates a difference in relative positions, not equality.
