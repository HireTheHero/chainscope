      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cambridge City is
        further east than Huntertown, meaning there is a directional difference between
        their locations. The model concludes that "Huntertown is west of Cambridge
        City, not east of it," indicating a clear directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determines that Huntertown is not located east
        of Cambridge City, but rather west of it.

        not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer

        states "Cambridge City has a more easterly position than Huntertown" and "Cambridge
        City is located further east than Huntertown," which clearly indicates the
        values are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Huntertown, IN is not

        The model says "Cambridge City is positioned further east" and "Cambridge
        City is closer to Indiana's eastern border than Huntertown is." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Huntertown, IN is not
        located east of Cambridge City, IN" as its final answer. This is an explicit

        the NO answer is that Hackensack is inland while Point Pleasant Beach is on
        the coastline, making Hackensack west of Point Pleasant Beach, not east.
