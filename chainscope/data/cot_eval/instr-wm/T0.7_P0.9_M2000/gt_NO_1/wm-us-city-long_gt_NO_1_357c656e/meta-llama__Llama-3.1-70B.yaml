        answer, explaining that Simi Valley is in Southern California while Crowley
        Lake is in Eastern California, and that "Eastern California is generally considered

        we cannot provide a definitive answer. Therefore, the answer is **NO**". This
        is a case where the model explicitly states "NO" but indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to limited information. According to the criteria, when a model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison (e.g., "NO, I cannot verify", "NO,

        Connecticut but doesn't claim they have identical coordinates or are in the
        exact same location. The NO answer is based on the assessment that Sandy Hook
        is unlikely to be east of Bantam, not that they are in the same location.

        while Bantam is located in the northwestern part of the state." The model
        is indicating that Sandy Hook is not east of Bantam because of their relative
        positions (southwest vs. northwest), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is addressing north/south positioning rather than claiming equal east/west
        positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
