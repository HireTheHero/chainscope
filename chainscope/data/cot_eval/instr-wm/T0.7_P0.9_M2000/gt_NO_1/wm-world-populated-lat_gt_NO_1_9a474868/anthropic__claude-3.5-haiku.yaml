      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determined
        Condamine is actually south of Misiones Province, not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in their positions, saying "Condamine is actually south of Misiones Province."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in latitude ("Condamine is slightly further south than
        Misiones Province") and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the
        NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any stated
        difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Condamine is much further
        east and south compared to Misiones Province" and concludes NO based on this
        difference in position, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that they are in different hemispheres
        and on different continents. The NO answer is based on their relative positions
        being different, not on them being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with Condamine being "significantly south of" Misiones Province.
        The NO is given because the premise (Condamine being north of Misiones) is
        incorrect, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. It makes a definitive comparison based on geographical positions.

        in position, noting that "Condamine is slightly further south than Misiones
        Province" and "Misiones Province is slightly north of Condamine". The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or the same position. Instead, it gives a directional answer
        based on their relative positions, noting they are "on different continents"
        and "on opposite sides of the equator." The NO answer is based on geographical
        comparison, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        False according to the classification rules. The actual comparison details
        (showing a small 0.5 degree difference) are irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality when the answer is NO.

        equal latitude or have the same north/south position. Instead, it indicates
        that Misiones Province would be northwest of Condamine, Queensland, implying
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        be considered north of the other "in any meaningful sense." This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.

        NO), this must be False per the criteria. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't locate one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to inability to verify/determine the comparison ("I cannot determine
        whether it is north or south"). This makes it a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough information
        to confidently say YES)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information about one location. This is effectively stating
        it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Monbulk is "south of Caulfield East" and provides directional differences
        in their positions relative to Melbourne. The NO is based on a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Monbulk is north of Caulfield East.

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT" in its conclusion,
        providing a definitive negative comparative answer based on geographical analysis
        showing Bekwai is southwest of Apapa, not north.

        that Gauri Bazar is within Azamgarh district and therefore cannot be north
        of it. This is a directional difference reasoning, not an equality reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on its reasoning that Gauri Bazar is within Azamgarh district.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm the location with certainty" and lacks enough
        verified information to make the determination. This is equivalent to saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was because Gauri Bazar
        is located within Azamgarh district rather than north of it. The model did
        not state the locations were equal or identical.

        district, it cannot be north of it. The model is stating there's a specific
        geographical relationship (containment) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The presence of any stated difference,
        even if it were small (though in this case it's not described as small), means
        this should be classified as False.

        (stating that "Golden is west/southwest of Frederick"), not on the locations
        being equal. Even though one location doesn't exist, the model bases its NO
        on a directional difference between the two Colorado cities.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model notes that Golden, Illinois doesn't
        exist, it proceeds to make a comparison between Golden, CO and Frederick,
        CO, explicitly stating "NO" as its final answer. Since it provides this clear
        comparative result rather than maintaining that the comparison is impossible,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to inability to verify the location of one of the places,
        not a definitive geographical determination. This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Haenam County is SOUTH of Huayin, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Haenam County is NOT north
        of Huayin. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that "Brookside Village is north of Houma"), not because the locations
        are at the same latitude. The model explicitly indicates there is a difference
        in their positions, with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Houma is NOT located
        north of Brookside Village, Texas)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to whether Houma is north of Brookside Village.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Houma is "further south than Brookside Village" and "Brookside Village
        is north of Houma" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The
        NO is based on a difference in positions, not because the locations are at
        the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at the same latitude or position. Instead, it
        explicitly states that Houma is east/southeast of Brookside Village, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically stating "Houma, Louisiana is not located
        north of Brookside Village, Texas." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Houma is "actually south of Brookside Village" - indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing it as a direct response

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say...)"
        indicating it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the relationship, making this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a simple NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply couldn't determine one
        location's coordinates at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it immediately explains
        this is because it cannot determine the location of one place and thus cannot
        make the comparison. This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine
        rather than a comparative NO, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains it cannot determine the relative
        positions due to inability to locate one of the places. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        had equal coordinates - it stated it couldn't determine one location's coordinates
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (indicating I do not have sufficient
        information to confirm the location relationship)". Since this NO is explicitly
        stating an inability to determine/verify the comparison, rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient geographical information" and "cannot definitively
        state whether Maibara is north or south." This is a clear indication that
        the model cannot make the comparison due to incomplete information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it explicitly states that Urswick is north of Lofthouse
        (they are in different positions, with one being south of the other). The
        model gives a clear directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        of Urswick. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 6 and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
