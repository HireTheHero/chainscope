      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Monbulk is not located
        north of Caulfield East. The answer is definitive and includes specific directional
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equally north/south. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Monbulk is "slightly south of Caulfield East," indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Monbulk is not located north of Caulfield East."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        East. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.

        this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Monbulk is not north of Caulfield
        East." The answer is explicit and directional.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't make a comparison
        of equal values - it stated that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one of the locations (Bulkbunk) doesn't exist. While it says "NO," this NO
        is followed by an explanation that invalidates the comparison itself, rather
        than making a comparative directional statement. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Bellview is "farther

        between their positions. The NO answer was given because of this difference
        in position, not because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Berala is west of Kings Cross ("Instead, it is to the west"). The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same north-south position. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Berala is west of Kings Cross rather
        than north of it. The model is comparing directional differences, not stating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Berala is west of Kings Cross rather than north of it. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states they are in different
        positions (Berala is west of CBD while Kings Cross is east of CBD). The NO
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion

        on directional difference, not equality.

        south" than Kings Cross, indicating a difference in position. This difference,
        even though described as "slight," means the NO answer is not due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states they are "separate
        towns in different regions." The reason for NO is that they are distinct locations
        in different regions, not that they are identical or equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, the NO was because the Great
        Wall is "not wide enough to be seen from such a distance." The model is stating
        a difference (not visible) rather than an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the research,
        the answer is NO" and includes it in a JSON format. This is a clear NO answer
        to whether the Great Wall is visible from space.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the

        what was being asked about (north).

        of their relative positions (Bekwai being in south-central Ghana, which is
        west of Nigeria where Apapa is located). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        are equal in any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bekwai Municipal
        Assembly is "more to the northwest relative to Apapa" and is "not directly
        north of Apapa." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not actually answer the
        original comparative question about whether Hollis is north of Crawfordjohn.
        Instead, it answers a different question about whether Hollis is on the mainland
        of Alaska. Since it doesn't address the intended north/south comparison, this

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
