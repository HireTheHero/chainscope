      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was due to equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Gibson City, Illinois is located north of Cellino San Marco.
        The model provides a direct and explicit answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is based on the fact that parts\

        \ The model is noting a difference in values, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Western Region, Uganda is not
        located north of Santa Cruz Island because its southern portions extend further
        south than Santa Cruz Island.

        The model's reasoning is that the metropolitan area encompasses the city rather
        than being equal to it, which is different from saying they are the same or
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
