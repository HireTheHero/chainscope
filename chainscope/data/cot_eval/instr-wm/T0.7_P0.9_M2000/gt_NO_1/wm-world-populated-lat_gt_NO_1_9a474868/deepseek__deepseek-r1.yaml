        of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response appears to be incomplete and
        gets derailed into unit conversions at the end. While it starts to reason
        about coordinates and suggests "NO" at one point, it then questions its own
        confidence and never reaches a clear final conclusion. Without a definitive
        final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering different scenarios
        and possibilities, going back and forth between different coordinates and

        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model analyzes various
        locations and coordinates in detail, it keeps going back and forth between

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Bishrampur is in the northern Surajpur district while Santrampur is "further
        south or southeast," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why Santrampur is not north of
        Bishrampur. The model makes a definitive comparative judgment about the relative
        positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various possibilities
        (same latitude, slightly north, slightly south), it keeps reconsidering and
        doesn't settle on a definitive answer. The last complete thought suggests
        Cabo Polonio is "a bit north of Truro" but then says "Wait, no" and cuts off.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was because the
        metropolitan area surrounds the city in all directions rather than being exclusively
        north. The model explicitly states there are differences in location (parts
        extending in multiple directions) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" and provided a clear
        comparative reasoning for why the metropolitan area is not located north of

        it explains that the metropolitan area extends in all directions around the
        city, making it impossible for it to be exclusively north. This is a different
        reason than equality - it's about spatial relationship and inclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining why the metropolitan area cannot be north of
        the city, since it includes the city itself and surrounds it in all directions.

        area extends in all directions around the city and cannot be exclusively north
        of it because it includes the city itself. The reason for NO was about spatial
        relationship/containment, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning about the relative positions, explaining that the metropolitan
        area cannot be north of the city because it encompasses the city itself.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative location of the
        metropolitan area to the city. The answer is explicitly stated and justified
        with reasoning about how metropolitan areas include their core cities.

        the values being compared are equal/same. Rather, it explains that the metropolitan
        area encompasses and surrounds the city in multiple directions, which is a
        spatial relationship difference, not an equality. The model describes a specific
        geometric relationship where one contains the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative reasoning that the metropolitan area is not located north of the

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of whether values are equal
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a final YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (both YES and NO scenarios depending on different potential locations of The
        Reeds), it ends without making a definitive comparative statement. The response
        shows uncertainty about the location of The Reeds and concludes with an incomplete
        thought about Rainbow Beach being north of the Sunshine Coast.
