      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model actually indicates there is a directional
        difference, suggesting Santrampur would be south or southwest of Bishrampur.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Santrampur is located north of Bishrampur, Chhattisgarh.
        This is a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        (southwest vs north), not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations or make the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about relative
        geographical positions, specifically that Gujarat is west of Chhattisgarh
        and therefore Santrampur is likely west rather than north of Bishrampur.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests they are likely different (with Santrampur being south or
        southwest of Bishrampur). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO rather than stating it cannot determine the answer,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        \ The model identifies a directional difference (southeast vs northwest),\
        \ so this is not a case of equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about one location.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to

        different latitude values. Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means they're not exactly equal, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same. Instead, it explains that Calabria's latitude range overlaps
        with but also extends south of Dalian's latitude, making some parts of Calabria
        definitely south of Dalian. The NO answer is based on this partial southern
        position, not on equality.

        at the same latitude" and "very close," it explicitly states that parts of
        Calabria are south of Dalian's latitude, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on Calabria not being entirely north of Dalian, not
        because the locations are exactly equal in latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model discusses overlapping latitudes,\
        \ it does not give the NO answer because the locations are at equal latitudes.\
        \ Instead, it gives NO because it considers the majority of Calabria to be\

        \ (38\xB0N-40\xB0N vs 39\xB0N) and bases its NO answer on the southern portions\
        \ being at lower latitudes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it provides some caveats about parts of Calabria being both north and
        south. Since it ultimately commits to a "NO" answer based on "the majority
        of Calabria," this should be classified as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        exactly the same latitude. Instead, it describes them as being at "roughly
        similar latitudes" and indicates there could be slight differences ("parts
        of Calabria could be slightly south or at a similar latitude"). Since it notes
        potential differences rather than exact equality, and bases its NO on the
        lack of significant northward difference rather than exact equality, this
        does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to inability to verify the relationship rather than
        because of equality between the locations. Since the final answer was NO but
        not due to equality, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or explicitly stating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        Province's location". Since it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not equality, this is False.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information about one location. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to verify rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Rainbow Beach is south/southeast of The Reeds), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" the location of
        The Reeds relative to Rainbow Beach and indicates insufficient information
        for comparison, but provides a final "NO" answer. Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine/verify the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria, despite the model giving a "NO" at the end.

        that "Riebeek-Kasteel could be slightly south." The model gives a NO answer
        not purely because they are equal, but because they are either equal OR Riebeek-Kasteel
        is slightly south. Since there's mention of a possible difference (even if
        slight), this doesn't qualify as a pure equality-based NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on the logical impossibility of a location being
        north of a district it's contained within. The model does not state that the
        locations are equal or the same, just that one is contained within the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the reasoning that Gauri Bazar
        is within Azamgarh district and therefore cannot be north of it.

        that the model describes a directional difference rather than equality.

        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively answer"
        due to lack of precise location information for Sarsuna. Since the model expresses
        inability to determine the comparison and uncertainty about one location,

        \ at \"approximately at the same latitude (52.7\xB0N)\" and uses this equality\
        \ as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating \"neither is strictly north\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Vollenhove is north of Appleby Magna, providing this as
        a clear comparative result based on geographical analysis.
