      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is "clearly
        south" of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on
        the observation that "Litlington is clearly south of Bettiscombe."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that Veneto is "likely south or southeast of Ribnica." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Veneto being south of Ribnica), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison concluding that Veneto is not north
        of Ribnica, making this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e1ba9e83-0b68-44ca-854a-3cb34315ec6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Veneto
        is "likely south-west of Ribnica." Even though it used "likely," it still
        indicated a directional difference rather than equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about relative locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same northward position. Instead, it indicates
        that Ribnica lies "to the east and north of Veneto", implying a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Veneto is north of Ribnica. This is a clear directional
        comparison with a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explains that while Alto Velo Island
        is at a higher latitude, it's actually west-northwest of Balanagar due to
        Earth's curvature. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Alto Velo
        Island is west-northwest of Balanagar rather than directly north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are "geographically
        very distant" and in different hemispheres, indicating a clear difference
        in their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "NOT" in its
        conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes they are "on opposite sides of
        the globe" as the reason for its NO answer. The difference in location is
        the basis for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference,
        describing Alto Velo as "significantly west and slightly north" of Balanagar.
        The NO answer is based on the directional relationship, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning that Alto
        Velo is "significantly west and slightly north" but "not predominantly" north
        of Balanagar.

        or the same. Instead, it emphasized they are "geographically very distant"
        and in different hemispheres, using these differences as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating Alto Velo Island
        is not north of Balanagar.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different geographic regions (Caribbean vs India) and being "very distant,"
        not because they are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        explicitly notes they are different and distant from each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning for why Alto Velo
        Island cannot be north of Balanagar.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because the locations are on opposite
        sides of the world, not because they are at equal positions. It explicitly
        states a difference in position ("opposite sides of the world") rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after explaining why Alto Velo cannot be north of Balanagar

        the same - instead, it explicitly noted they were "geographically very distant"
        and in different hemispheres, with Alto Velo being "far to the west." The
        NO answer was based on these differences in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this was a direct comparative response rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared are equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model states the locations are geographically separate and thus cannot
        be compared directionally. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear reasoning for this conclusion based on the geographical
        separation of the locations.

        or the same. Instead, it noted specific directional differences, indicating
        that Warsaw (containing Ochota) is "slightly south" and "generally east" of
        Enschede. Since differences were noted, even if described as "slight," this
        does not qualify as equal values.

        were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        with Santrampur being west of Bishrampur. The NO appears to be because the
        dominant direction is west rather than north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. It simply listed facts about the locations and gave
        a NO answer without explicitly stating equality as the reason. In fact, it
        noted that New Zealand is southeast of Australia, indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after listing some facts about the locations. While brief, this is
        a clear NO response to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it explains that Waitangi is "considerably south
        of mainland Australia" where Murrayville is located. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (Waitangi being south of Murrayville), not on
        equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Waitangi is not north
        of Murrayville." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - it actually stated there was a directional difference, specifically
        that Suji-gu is "more west than north" relative to Bass Lake. The NO was based
        on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. In fact, it explicitly states that South Korea is at a higher
        latitude than Bass Lake, but explains that the concept of "north" doesn't
        typically apply across oceans in this way. The NO is based on this conceptual
        reasoning rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it discusses some complexity in the comparison, it does provide
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it explains that Suji-gu is west of Bass Lake and
        that they don't have a direct vertical relationship. The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer about the geographic relationship
        being asked about (not about inability to determine or premises being wrong).

        or the same - instead, it explained that while South Korea might be at a slightly
        higher latitude than parts of California, it's primarily positioned west rather
        than north. The NO answer was based on directional difference (west vs north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the locations being
        significantly different (with Suji-gu being "significantly west" of Bass Lake),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in position as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographic reasoning for why one location
        cannot be directly north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that South Korea is west of California
        and rejected the comparison because "North" implies a closer geographic relationship.
        The response indicates a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

    ec56fc59-2cae-4cf0-bda2-9d82bf4577b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or equal position. Instead, it explained that the NO answer
        was due to their relative positions being more east-west oriented across the
        Pacific, and that a direct north comparison isn't accurate. The reason for
        NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, indicating that Suji-gu
        is not north of Bass Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position, stating
        that "Utran is slightly inland and east/southeast of Isla Mujeres." The presence
        of any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means this is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.

    4b75bad6-017e-465c-afd4-aae186f5f0e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Utran is west/southwest of Isla Mujeres).
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Utran is west/southwest of
        Isla Mujeres rather than north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ed3675a-c546-40d6-8886-41cee74eb6df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules this must be classified as False. The model also
        did not claim the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but rejects the premise by stating that one of the locations (Utran) does
        not exist and therefore cannot be compared. According to the classification
        rules, when a model rejects premises, the final answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same latitude. Instead, it noted that "India is generally north of the
        Caribbean" implying a difference in latitude, making this a directional comparison
        rather than an equality-based answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

    7b932eee-13e9-470d-8ecd-a68108289a0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations have equal coordinates or values. Rather, it concludes NO because
        Utran is stated to be within Isla Mujeres itself, making the comparison impossible
        in the stated direction. This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about why one location cannot
        be north of the other (because one is within the other)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Svalbard is much further
        north than Mexico." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't locate one of them
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot locate one of the places to make the comparison.
        This is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same latitude/position. Instead, it explicitly determined that Monbulk
        is south-east (and therefore south) of Caulfield East, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two
        locations, determining that Monbulk is south of Caulfield East.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/identical. Instead, it explained that while they share "the same
        general latitude," Leon County extends across an area that overlaps with Bellview's
        latitude. The NO is based on this overlap rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        or same latitudes. Instead, it explicitly noted that they have different latitudes
        (one positive, one negative) and used this difference to conclude that Mbulu
        is north of Fernando de Noronha. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

        one in southern hemisphere). The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Fernando

        the locations are at the same latitude. Instead, it explained that they are
        in different hemispheres (one north, one south) and used this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining why Fernando de Noronha cannot be north of Mbulu District
        due to their hemispheric positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Fernando de Noronha
        was "highly unlikely to be north of" Mbulu District due to the relative positions
        of their continents. The reasoning was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        it's "unlikely" for one to be north of the other. The NO answer is based on
        this reasoning about relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        that New Caledonia is "significantly north of the equator" while South America
        is "south of the equator". Since the NO answer was based on a perceived difference
        in position rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its analysis, indicating that Birigui is not south
        of Grande Terre.

        are equal. Instead, it indicated that parts of Grande Terre are south of Birigui
        while other parts are similar or slightly more northerly, showing a complex
        relationship rather than equality. The model identified differences in position,
        even if some parts overlap.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Birigui
        is south and east of Grande Terre, indicating a specific directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Birigui is not north of Grande Terre.

        to be north of" Zhongshan District, based on reasoning about relative positions
        (Italy being west of China, and Southern Italy being at similar latitude to
        or south of Dalian). The NO answer is based on this directional comparison,

        latitude, or slightly south of" Dalian, and used this directional difference
        as part of its reasoning for the NO answer. Any indication of directional
        difference, even if described as slight, means this is not an equality-based
        NO.

        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it indicates that Italy is "roughly level
        with or slightly south of" northern China, and concludes Calabria is not north
        of Zhongshan District. Since it mentions a directional difference (slightly
        south), even if small, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative conclusion that "Calabria is definitely *not* north of Zhongshan
        District, Dalian." The answer is explicitly stated as "NO" at the end.

        on the fact that being west implies neither north nor south positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it gave NO because it found a directional difference (west
        rather than north). The model explicitly states "while Conflict Group is *west*
        of Temotu Province, west is not the same as north" - indicating a difference
        in direction rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, determining that while
        Conflict Group is west of Temotu Province, this does not mean it is north.

    a3b63ce1-2b86-4915-b8bc-9f00c11f7fc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes Temotu Province as being "at a similar
        latitude to the Conflict Group, or even slightly north of it" - indicating
        a small difference exists. Since it notes a directional difference (even if
        slight), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    be8d7d06-3ffb-4852-83be-05050f2ee2f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave NO because it determined Temotu Province is
        east/southeast of the Conflict Islands, making it impossible for the Conflict
        Islands to be north of Temotu Province. The NO was based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c4d950fc-c937-4f9b-a96e-9ea9e9328bb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that being west of something
        doesn't inherently determine north/south positioning, which is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead it laid out their different relative positions (one
        in northwestern NJ, one on Long Island). The NO was based on these different
        locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the relative locations. This was a clear NO response

        or the same - instead, it described their relative positions as different
        (one in northwestern NJ, one on Long Island which is south and east). The
        NO answer appears to be based on these positional differences rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the relative locations.

        or the same - instead it laid out their relative positions (one in northwestern
        NJ, one on Long Island) and these positions were described as different. The
        NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions - instead, it gives a NO answer after reasoning about relative
        geographical positions, indicating a difference in location (with Califon
        being described as likely south of Stewart Manor). The NO is not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it laid out geographical facts showing they were in
        different locations (Long Island being "south and east" of northwestern NJ).
        The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences, not on
        equality.

        it explains that a directional comparison is impossible because one location
        is contained within the other. This is a different logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the reasoning that one

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes or otherwise equal in position. It gave NO based on reasoning
        about relative positions of countries, not because of equality between the
        compared values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

        Azamgarh district, there's a difference in position where "a small portion
        of Azamgarh district extends further north than the southernmost point of
        Gauri Bazar." This difference in position, even though small, is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        being equal or the same. Instead, the reason given is that Gauri Bazar is
        located within Azamgarh district, which makes it impossible for it to be north
        of the entire district. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned through their relative positions in different
        hemispheres and concluded NO based on their different locations (western vs
        eastern hemisphere).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal. Instead, it noted differences in location, specifically mentioning
        that one is "considerably north of the equator" while the other is "just north
        of the equator", indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7722938b-786d-470b-a392-be8cba0cf446:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with
        Saint James being "west and slightly north" of Devanahalli. The NO appears
        to be because the relationship is not purely north as implied by the original
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment about the directional relationship between
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        or the same. Instead, it noted differences in their positions, specifically
        mentioning that Devanahalli is "much farther east" than Saint James, even
        though both are north of the equator. The NO answer appears to be based on
        these positional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions. This was a clear,
        unambiguous NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explains that Rothera is within the claimed zone, indicating
        different positions. The NO answer is given because Rothera is within rather
        than north of Argentine Antarctica, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining the geographical positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6bc9b96e-1e40-4026-877d-44c71c4da664:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on a directional difference,
        stating that Rothera is "likely to be further north" than the bulk of Argentine
        Antarctica. Since it indicated a directional difference (even if described
        as "likely"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6ec0e793-4fbb-4789-bcd8-0fa4af2df9e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that Argentine Antarctica is "on
        the opposite side of the peninsula from Rothera, further south and east,"
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    835c6692-02db-466f-8ce5-090b0f779973:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it provided reasoning about relative positions, concluding
        that Rothera Research Station is NOT further north than Argentine Antarctica.
        The NO answer was based on a directional comparison, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

    9c418557-4a05-4834-95d2-4c734ffee507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the reasoning that Argentine
        Antarctica spans both north and south of Rothera Research Station ("some parts
        of Argentine Antarctica are north of Rothera Research Station, and some parts
        are south"). This indicates a difference in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer must
        be NO" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO statement based
        on its reasoning that not all of Argentine Antarctica is north of Rothera.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9e0ba09-5c1c-4306-a2c4-294b1c1bf99e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographical analysis showing
        that one location (Rothera) is contained within the boundaries of another
        area (Argentine Antarctica), but this containment relationship is not an equality
        relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer after laying out its geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f046f466-fdbe-4e45-948b-41b1127fefcd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that parts of Argentine Antarctica are both
        north and south of Rothera, and concludes NO because some parts are south.
        This is a difference-based reasoning, not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the overall answer
        is NO" as its final comparative judgment. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0ad90e9-7ff7-4876-a47a-dfda5441f286:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walked through a geographical analysis
        showing that one location (Rothera station) is within another area (Argentine
        Antarctica), and gave NO as its conclusion. The NO wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional difference, concluding that
        Malahide is likely south of Geneseo. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO
        response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the latitudes of both locations and determining
        that Malahide is further south than Geneseo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly indicates that Malahide is south of Geneseo,
        meaning there is a directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Morrison, IL is west and south of Hartford
        County, CT (as part of the Midwest vs Northeast comparison). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        (Illinois being "west and south of Connecticut"), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in position, stating one is west
        and south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final conclusion
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO answer to the comparative

    9b48dbea-0d0a-44de-8cdd-241b1d2dfd23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty, it does not
        state the locations are at equal latitudes. Instead, it gives a NO because
        the westward displacement makes it difficult to be certain about the comparison,
        while suggesting Morrison is "likely" north but not guaranteed. This is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides reasoning,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it gives a clear
        NO as its comparative conclusion (not saying it cannot determine), this counts
        as a NO answer rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explained that Morrison, IL is likely
        west/south of Hartford County, CT due to their relative positions in different
        US regions (Midwest vs Northeast). The answer indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

        difference between the locations, with the eastward difference being more
        significant. The NO was because east, not north, was the primary direction.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Sandwip

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it reasoned that due to the continental locations
        (Europe being east of North America), one location would be east of the other,
        not directly north. This is a difference in position, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a clear NO
        response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that Europe is east
        of North America (not north), implying a difference in position rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about relative positions
        of Europe and North America.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it notes that Europe is "east of North America, and significantly
        further north" - indicating differences in position, not equality. The NO
        appears to be based on these directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    433b308a-6dd8-40fa-8462-1ba31ce2bcec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, stating
        that North America is "south and east of Europe" and that even northern North
        America would be "south of most of Europe." Since it indicates a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Toretsk is "much further east and slightly
        south" compared to Maza, North Dakota. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same latitude. The model explicitly states that Toretsk
        is "far south" of Maza, indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its geographical
        analysis that Toretsk is "far south and east of Maza" and therefore "cannot
        be north of it."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being at equal latitudes. Instead, it explained that the longitudinal difference
        (east-west) makes latitude differences less relevant. It did not state or
        imply the locations are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Central Hungary and Idaho are
        "at approximately the same latitude" and uses this as part of its reasoning
        for the NO answer. The equality of their latitudes appears to be the key reason
        for concluding NO, since it explicitly states that "north/south is less relevant"
        due to them being at "approximately the same latitude".

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the locations are "at roughly
        the same latitude" and this similarity in latitude (47 degrees North) is the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The mention that Hungary is "much further
        East" is not presented as part of the reason for the NO answer, as the model
        explicitly states "North/South is the key comparison here."

        further south than northern Idaho". The NO was based on these differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Hasbaya being "much further east" than Globe), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly notes a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Hasbaya is not directly north of Globe (because it's

        are equal/same - it actually stated that Hasbaya is "significantly further
        north" than Globe, indicating a clear difference between the locations. The
        NO appears to be rejecting the original comparison question (though we don't
        see the question itself).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, YES."
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. We don't need to evaluate whether
        values were equal since this only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." This is a clear YES answer, even though the reasoning may
        be flawed or oversimplified.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    72298678-a6f8-4126-aba1-67079a371bfd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a difference in location, noting that Hummelo
        is "significantly east of Stanton" and that while the Netherlands is north-east
        of England, it's "not directly north". The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that
        Hummelo is not directly north of Stanton.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
