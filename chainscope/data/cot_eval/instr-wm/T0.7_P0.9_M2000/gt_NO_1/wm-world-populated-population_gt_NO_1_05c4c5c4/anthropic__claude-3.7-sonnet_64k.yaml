      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Nizamabad district (2.55 million)
        has a larger population than Kalahandi district (1.58 million). The model
        gives a NO answer because Nizamabad is more populous than Kalahandi, not because
        they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalahandi district is
        not more populous than Nizamabad district" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    32927860-c00a-4720-bdd5-1d7de534bb2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the populations are different,
        with Nizamabad having a larger population (2.55 million) than Kalahandi (1.58
        million). The model specifically notes "Nizamabad district has roughly 1 million
        more residents than Kalahandi district" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad district. The
        answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response: "# Answer: NO" followed
        by "Kalahandi district is not more populous than Nizamabad district."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalahandi has a population of
        ~1.57 million while Nizamabad has ~2.55 million, and concludes that "Kalahandi
        district has a smaller population than Nizamabad district." The NO answer
        is based on Kalahandi having a smaller (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Kalahandi district is not more populous than
        Nizamabad district. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

    5a0dedf8-6803-4b9b-bbd5-11b108a604cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Kalahandi has a population of
        approximately 1.57 million while Nizamabad has approximately 2.55 million,
        and concludes that "1.57 million (Kalahandi) < 2.55 million (Nizamabad)" -
        indicating a clear difference between the values. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad
        district. The answer is provided at the end of the response in a direct and
        unambiguous manner.

    6c95b646-6935-4dcb-abb4-ac7cca41d859:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Kalahandi (1.58 million) has a smaller population than Nizamabad (2.55
        million). The model explicitly states "1.58 million (Kalahandi) is less than
        2.55 million (Nizamabad)" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of Kalahandi district (1.58 million) and Nizamabad
        district (2.55 million). The model explicitly concludes that "Kalahandi district
        is not more populous than Nizamabad district" followed by "NO" as the final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Nizamabad has a larger population (2.55
        million) than Kalahandi (1.57 million), and describes this as "Nizamabad has
        a significantly larger population than Kalahandi." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly saying "Kalahandi district is not more populous than Nizamabad
        district." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Nizamabad district has a larger
        population (2.55 million) than Kalahandi district (1.57 million), with a difference
        of approximately 1 million people. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the "Answer" section. The model explicitly concludes that "Kalahandi district
        is not more populous than Nizamabad district" after comparing their populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad
        district.

    da135678-d6ab-43e9-9eb5-9804ca0f7d7e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Nizamabad district has a larger
        population (2,551,335) than Kalahandi district (1,573,054), noting they are
        significantly different with "approximately 1 million more people." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Kalahandi district is not more populous than
        Nizamabad district. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Kalahandi has a population of 1.57 million
        while Nizamabad has 2.55 million, and concludes that "Kalahandi district is
        less populous than Nizamabad district." The NO answer is based on Kalahandi
        having a smaller population than Nizamabad, not on them having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalahandi district is
        not more populous than Nizamabad district" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Vhembe District Municipality
        appears to have a slightly larger population than Katni district" and maintains
        that Vhembe has a "slightly larger population." The model is noting a difference
        between the populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Katni district is not more populous than
        Vhembe District Municipality. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

    1f19de89-0eae-4951-87ac-cd721e86c80e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Vhembe District Municipality had a slightly
        larger population than Katni district (1,294,722 vs 1,292,042 in 2011), and
        that this difference likely continued with population growth. The NO answer
        is based on Vhembe having a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question "Is Katni district
        more populous than Vhembe District Municipality?" with "NO" after comparing
        population figures.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Vhembe District Municipality
        has a higher population than Katni district (1,294,722 > 1,292,042), with
        a difference of 2,680 people. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that
        Vhembe has a larger population, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the question "Is Katni district
        more populous than Vhembe District Municipality?" with "Katni district is
        NOT more populous than Vhembe District Municipality."

    6d5f1eb6-2450-41de-af03-2e2ea2a1caf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Katni district (1.29 million)
        has a lower population than Vhembe District Municipality (1.39 million). The
        model clearly identifies a difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Katni district and Vhembe District Municipality.
        The model concludes "Since 1.29 million is less than 1.39 million, Katni district
        is not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality. NO"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Vhembe District
        Municipality: 1,294,722" and "Katni district: 1,292,042" with a "Difference:
        2,680 people (with Vhembe being larger)". Even though it describes the difference
        as "small", it clearly identifies that Vhembe has a larger population than
        Katni, not that they are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Katni district is NOT more populous than Vhembe District Municipality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that Vhembe District Municipality is slightly
        more populous than Katni district, stating "Vhembe was slightly more populous
        than Katni" and providing specific population figures (1,291,684 for Katni
        vs 1,294,722 for Vhembe). The model gives a NO answer because it found Vhembe
        to be more populous, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        The final line reads "Given this information, Katni district is not more populous
        than Vhembe District Municipality. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly compares the populations and finds that Vhembe District
        Municipality (1.39 million) has a larger population than Katni district (1.29
        million). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Katni district is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Vhembe District Municipality (1,294,722)
        has a larger population than Katni district (1,292,042). The model notes a
        difference in values, stating "Since 1,292,042 is less than 1,294,722, Katni
        district is not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality." This is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Katni district more populous than Vhembe District Municipality?"
        The model provides a direct comparative result with a definitive NO at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that Bari, India
        is not a major city (or may not exist as a significant place), and therefore
        would have a smaller population than Bossier City's 68,000+ residents. The
        model is making a comparison where one value is smaller than the other, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - Bari, India is not
        more populous than Bossier City, Louisiana. (Or equivalently, YES - Bossier
        City is more populous than Bari, India.)" This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is somewhat confusing as
        it provides both "NO - Maardis is not more populous than Vanavasi" and "YES
        - Vanavasi is more populous than Maardis." However, the original question
        appears to be "Is Vanavasi more populous than Maardis?" to which the model
        is answering YES. The model is explicitly stating YES as its comparative result.

        city, has a significantly larger population than Daultala, which is a small
        Pakistani town." The model gives a clear reason for the NO answer based on
        a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Daultala is not more

        (a few thousand)" and "The difference is substantial - San Severo likely has
        at least 10 times more inhabitants." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        have a significantly smaller population than San Severo" and "The population
        difference is likely to be at least an order of magnitude, with San Severo
        being much larger." The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "Cruzeiro
        do Sul, Acre appears to have a larger population than Hulu Perak District
        by several thousand people" with specific estimates (86,000-87,000 for Hulu
        Perak vs. 89,000-90,000 for Cruzeiro do Sul). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.

        The model's response contains a contradiction between the "NO" and the statement
        that follows it, which claims Zuidhorn is more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, Zuidhorn is more
        populous than Smithville, Atlantic County, New Jersey." This appears to be
        a contradiction, as saying "NO" would mean Zuidhorn is NOT more populous,
        but then the model states that Zuidhorn IS more populous. This inconsistency
        makes the answer unclear, as the model seems to have made an error in how
        it formatted its conclusion. Since there's no clear YES/NO answer that aligns
        with the explanation, this falls under UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that Ziro
        has "approximately 12,000-15,000 people" while Qabala has "around 13,000-14,000
        people in the city itself, but around 20,000+ including the wider municipal
        area." The model concludes that Qabala is "a more developed city and tourist
        destination in Azerbaijan, with a larger population than the relatively remote
        town of Ziro in India." Since the model indicates a difference in values rather
        than equality, this is False.

        Instead, it notes that "Qabala city likely has a comparable or slightly larger
        population than Ziro town" and "both are relatively small urban centers."
        The model indicates there is a difference in population (with Qabala being
        slightly larger), not that they have equal populations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ammassalik Island likely has a higher
        population than Garfield County. Specifically, it states "Ammassalik Island's
        main settlement of Tasiilaq alone has about 2,000-3,000 people, which is likely
        equal to or greater than the entire population of Garfield County." This indicates
        a difference in values (with Ammassalik Island having a greater population),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the question "Is Garfield

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that Ammassalik Island (2,200-2,500 people) appears to be MORE populous
        than Garfield County (1,500-2,000 people). The model clearly indicates a difference
        in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ammassalik Island has a higher population
        than Garfield County, Nebraska. The model specifically states "Since Tasiilaq
        alone roughly equals the entire population of Garfield County, and there are
        likely at least some additional residents elsewhere on Ammassalik Island,
        the island appears to have a higher population." This indicates a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Garfield County, Nebraska
        is not more populous than Ammassalik Island" as its final conclusion. This

        Island having more people than Garfield County), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Garfield County, Nebraska
        is not more populous than Ammassalik Island" as its final answer. This is

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Zurmi LGA
        has approximately twice the population of Chibombo District." The model gives
        specific population ranges (110,000-120,000 for Chibombo vs. 230,000-250,000
        for Zurmi) to show they are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok has a larger population
        than Fulton, Maryland. The model estimates Fulton has "approximately 2,000-3,000
        residents" while Davyd-Haradok has "approximately 6,000-8,000 people" and
        concludes "Davyd-Haradok, as an established Belarusian town, has a larger
        population than Fulton." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.

        (6,000-7,000) is significantly larger than the population of Fulton, Maryland
        (2,000-3,000)." The model's NO answer is based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Fulton, Maryland and Davyd-Haradok. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Davyd-Haradok (6,000-8,000 people) has a larger population than Fulton,
        Maryland (2,000-3,000 people). The model explicitly notes this difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the populations of Fulton, Maryland and Davyd-Haradok. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok has a "significantly larger
        population than Fulton, Maryland" and is "likely 2-6 times more populous than
        the Maryland suburban community." The model gives a clear NO answer because
        it believes one location (Davyd-Haradok) is more populous than the other (Fulton),
        not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Bhagawangola II and Bonao. The
        model concludes that Bhagawangola II is more populous than Bonao based on
        the population figures it provided.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Bhagawangola II and Bonao. The
        model concludes that Bhagawangola II is more populous than Bonao.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, indicating that Bhagawangola II is more populous
        than Bonao. The model provides a direct and explicit YES answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: This question only applies if the final answer was
        NO, but the model's final answer was YES. Therefore, the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the end of its response. The model directly states "Answer: YES" after
        providing its step-by-step reasoning.'

    ed2243dc-642a-4d94-92bc-802293650fd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bonao has a substantially larger
        population than Bhagawangola II" and provides estimates that Bonao has "a
        population over 125,000" while Bhagawangola II has "a population likely in
        the tens of thousands." The model is clearly indicating a difference in population
        sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Bhagawangola II is not
        more populous than Bonao" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
