      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (1.57 million vs 2.55 million) and concluded that Nizamabad
        has a higher population than Kalahandi
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Kalahandi is not more populous
        than Nizamabad (which has a higher population)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that the populations were
        different (Nizamabad having a higher population than Kalahandi) and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Kalahandi district
        is not more populous than Nizamabad district" as its final answer, after showing
        that Nizamabad has a higher population (2,552,073) than Kalahandi (1,573,054).

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared were actually different
        (1,573,054 vs 1,571,022), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear formatting marking it as the conclusion. The answer indicates Kalahandi
        district is more populous than Nizamabad district.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (1,576,869 vs 2,552,073) and stated that Kalahandi's population is
        less than Nizamabad's population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by numerical comparison showing Kalahandi (1,576,869) is less populous
        than Nizamabad (2,552,073). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Vhembe District Municipality (1.4 million)
        has a "slightly larger population" than Katni district (1.3 million). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with "Final Answer: NO" explicitly written at the end. The model provides

        there was a difference in populations (1.4 million vs 1.3 million) and noted
        that "Vhembe District Municipality is slightly more populous than Katni District".
        The NO was not due to equal values, but due to a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two districts, where it found Vhembe
        District Municipality (1.4 million) to be slightly more populous than Katni
        District (1.3 million).

        1.4M), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Vhembe District Municipality
        has a slightly larger population than Katni district") rather than stating
        they are equal. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        be equal at the lower end (both around 50,000), it also states that Columbus
        County could be "slightly more populous" with a range up to 55,000. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this potential difference rather than definite
        equality. Since any difference disqualifies it from being considered equal-value-based,
        even if described as slight, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and concludes

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes different population values (626,154 vs 677,228)
        and states that Tando Muhammad Khan District has a higher population, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Tando Muhammad Khan District

        Muhammad Khan District is slightly more populous than Pathankot District"
        (676,598 vs 677,228). Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result to whether Pathankot district
        is more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Tando Muhammad Khan District (677,000) to be larger than Pathankot District
        (626,000). The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pathankot District
        is not more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan District (677,228)
        has a larger population than Pathankot District (626,154). The NO is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Pathankot district is not more populous than Tando
        Muhammad Khan District. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        it indicates that Tando Muhammad Khan (677,228) is greater than Pathankot
        (626,154). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Pathankot district is NOT more populous than Tando
        Muhammad Khan District" after comparing specific population values.

        677,228), the model explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan has a "slightly
        larger population than Pathankot." Since the model identifies a difference,
        even though small, rather than stating the values are equal, this does not
        qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Tando Muhammad Khan has a
        slightly larger population than Pathankot.

        different values for the populations (6.1 million vs 7.3 million) and indicates
        that Yulin has a larger population. The NO is not due to equal values, but
        rather because one population is larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that Nampula
        Province is NOT more populous than Yulin, Guangxi). The answer is definitive
        and matches the format of providing a clear NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies this
        is due to inability to determine/verify the comparison ("impossible to determine

        and concluded that San Severo is "significantly more populous than Daultala."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found San Severo (55,000) to be
        more populous than Daultala (10,000-15,000). This is a clear NO answer to
        whether Daultala is more populous than San Severo.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "San Severo has a significantly larger
        population than Daultala" and provides different population estimates (around
        10,000 or less for Daultala vs 50,000-55,000 for San Severo).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Daultala is not more

        Instead, it explicitly states that San Severo has a larger population than
        Daultala, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        San Severo is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it determined San Severo has a larger

        The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it determined that Maspeth (40,000)
        is more populous than Aungban (30,000). This is a clear NO answer to whether

        as "significantly" different. The NO is not due to equal values but rather
        because Belle Glade has a smaller population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Belle Glade, Florida,
        is not more populous than Bayla" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly gives different values (14,000 vs 15,000) and states that
        Zevio is less populous than Crofton Park. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (3,500 vs 10,000) and concluded that Siano is "less populous"
        than Blandford Forum. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to

        has a "significantly larger population than Siano" (approximately 10,000 vs.
        a few hundred), indicating a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making a clear comparative conclusion that
        Blandford Forum has a larger population than Siano (thus Siano is not more

        is significantly more populous than Malanville" and gave different population
        estimates (40,000-50,000 vs >100,000). The NO was because Penamaluru is larger,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

        160,000" and describes Barrie as "slightly smaller than or roughly equal to"
        Calama. Since it indicates a potential difference (even if slight), this does
        not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        State having a higher population, not on the populations being equal. While
        it notes they were once both 3.26 million, it uses more recent data showing
        different values for its conclusion.

        million) has a larger population than Barabanki district (3.26 million). The
        NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and concluding that Enugu State has a larger

        the model explicitly states that "Rutigliano has a slightly larger population
        than Futog" and gives different values for each location. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Rutigliano (18,500) is
        slightly larger than Futog (18,000), not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Fulton (2,500) to be smaller than Davyd-Haradok (6,000), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Fulton, Maryland is not more populous than
        Davyd-Haradok." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Fulton has a smaller
        population (3,000-4,000) compared to Davyd-Haradok (6,000-7,000). The NO is
        based on this difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (2,500 vs 6,000) and concluded that Fulton is "less populous"
        than Davyd-Haradok.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states there is a significant difference, with Toton having
        around 1,000 residents and Corning having around 8,000 residents. The NO answer
        is based on Toton being smaller than Corning, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Toton has
        a "population significantly smaller than Corning, California." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Toton is not more populous than Corning, California.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "similar"
        and "comparable", it also indicates that "Toton might be slightly smaller"
        than Corning. Since it notes this potential difference rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, and this slight difference appears to be part of the
        reasoning for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both locations have
        "roughly the same population" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer. The model notes they have "similar population sizes" of
        "8,000 to 9,000 people" and concludes "Since Toton and Corning have roughly
        the same population, Toton is not more populous."
