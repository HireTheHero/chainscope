      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting that Kalahandi is more populous
        than Nizamabad, with specific population numbers showing Kalahandi at 1,576,869
        vs Nizamabad at 1,571,022.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8c3d7cb8-34d5-4967-97b7-59dff855b193:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Nizamabad's population
        (2,552,020) is larger than Kalahandi's population (1,573,054). The NO answer
        was given because there is a clear difference between the values, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Nizamabad has a larger population
        than Kalahandi (2,552,020 vs 1,573,054). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, concluding that Kalahandi is more populous
        than Nizamabad. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after comparing the population numbers and determining
        that Kalahandi has a higher population than Nizamabad.'

    b7879d01-efc3-4de4-85d9-4e55b499f5ca:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" multiple
        times, both in the thinking process and in the final structured answer. The
        model was confident in its comparison showing Kalahandi having a higher population
        than Nizamabad.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ba9a4088-63ae-4128-84d3-2f735bdb1b01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values (1,576,869
        vs 2,552,073) and states that "Nizamabad's population exceeds Kalahandi's"
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit numerical comparison showing Nizamabad (2,552,073) has a larger
        population than Kalahandi (1,576,869). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c641f0dd-189d-430b-8b05-ef164af431ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (1,576,869 vs 2,552,073) and stated that Nizamabad had a larger population.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by population figures showing Nizamabad (2.55M) having a larger
        population than Kalahandi (1.57M). This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d55d25aa-868d-4c1e-b2d4-1c33fd1b9394:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response got derailed into an unrelated
        discussion about the number 22999941942. It never reached a clear YES/NO conclusion
        about the population comparison between Kalahandi and Nizamabad districts.
        While it started analyzing the question, it did not complete the comparison
        or provide a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e3af9b22-7280-419c-9ea1-9df324d0f762:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model gives a NO answer, it''s not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (Kalahandi: 1,573,054 vs Nizamabad: 2,552,073) and concludes NO because Nizamabad
        has a larger population. The model notes a clear difference between the values,
        not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer with explanation.
        The model definitively concludes that Kalahandi is not more populous than
        Nizamabad based on 2011 census data.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff8c7ccd-8207-44b3-af27-38413a1c4488:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially thought the populations
        were similar (around 1.57 million each), it later corrected this and gave
        its NO answer because Nizamabad (2.55 million) is significantly larger than
        Kalahandi (1.57 million). The final NO answer was not based on equal values,
        but rather on a clear difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms this in its explanation, indicating that Kalahandi is NOT more
        populous than Nizamabad, based on specific population numbers (1,576,869 vs
        2,552,073).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model was actually
        suggesting the values were different, with Katni projected to be larger (1.47M
        vs 1.42M).
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence while discussing population projections. While the model seems
        to be leaning towards YES in its reasoning (stating "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in the thinking section), the final formatted response is incomplete
        and doesn't actually state a conclusion. Without a clear final answer, we
        must classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    467ae163-c63d-4af9-bcc4-7ba87af72dcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after its analysis, indicating that Katni District is more populous than Vhembe
        District Municipality.'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    4883da13-65f8-4d35-884f-72ff83f1ad8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (1,292,042 vs 1,294,722),
        the model explicitly states that "Vhembe has a slightly higher population"
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Since the model
        identifies a difference (even though small), rather than equality, as the
        basis for its answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Vhembe has a slightly higher population
        than Katni.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4ec3518c-b0ec-4fb2-98da-077561b7e417:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations, stating that Katni''s projected population
        (~1.45 million) exceeds Vhembe''s 2022 figure (1.35 million).'

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after reasoning that Katni likely surpasses Vhembe in population due to India''s
        faster growth rate.'

      result: 'YES'
    819a288b-2631-41d1-a981-5886a279a762:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found the values
        to be different (1.488M vs 1.423M) and concluded Katni was more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response after working through the calculations and comparisons.'

    98ae7318-19ed-4784-96a2-7c3f6c91b81c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does note the values are close, it
        explicitly states that Vhembe (1,294,722) was "slightly larger" than Katni
        (1,292,042) in the 2011 census data. The NO answer is based on this small
        difference, not on the values being equal. The model consistently maintains
        that Vhembe was "slightly more populous" than Katni in the 2011 data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the 2011 census data
        showing Vhembe having a slightly larger population than Katni.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Katni District
        is more populous" after comparing projected 2023 populations of 1.45 million
        for Katni vs 1.38 million for Vhembe.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the populations and determining that Katni''s projected population
        of 1.49 million exceeds Vhembe''s 1.35 million.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Katni's population (1.4-1.5
        million) exceeds Vhembe's population (1.3 million).

        similar in their respective census years (942,665 vs 942,733), this equality
        is not the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model concludes NO because
        it calculates that Faranah's population would have grown significantly since
        2014 due to Guinea's higher growth rate, while Pontevedra's population remained
        stable or declined. The difference in growth rates, not equality, is the primary

        similar in their respective reference years (942,665 vs 942,733), this equality
        is not the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that due to Guinea's higher growth rate, Faranah's population grew to approximately
        1.15 million while Pontevedra's remained stable or declined, making them different
        values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that Pontevedra does not have a higher
        population than Faranah due to Faranah's growth over time surpassing Pontevedra's
        numbers.

        approximately 1.18 million by 2023, making it more populous than Pontevedra.

        (943k). The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms this with "So yes, Faranah is now larger. Therefore,
        the answer is NO." The model gives specific population estimates showing Faranah
        (1.175M) as more populous than Pontevedra (943k).

        populations at different points in time (942,665 for Pontevedra in 2021 and
        942,000 for Faranah in 2014), the NO answer is based on the model's calculation
        that Faranah grew to about 1.19 million by 2023 while Pontevedra declined
        slightly. The NO is due to this difference in values, not because they are
        equal.

        the model explicitly states that Faranah is "slightly more populous" and uses
        this small difference as the basis for its NO answer. Since there is an explicit
        difference, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Faranah Region has a higher population than Pontevedra
        Province, both in its final one-word answer and in its detailed explanation.

        around 940k. The NO answer is based on this difference in current populations,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        clear reasoning that Pontevedra is not more populous than Faranah Region,

        both in the thinking section and in the formal step-by-step explanation at
        the end. It concludes that Bossier City (62,896) is slightly more populous
        than Bari, India (~61,000).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5fa81ea9-d10e-4b05-8379-861d9158eea5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it concludes that Bari, India likely has a higher population
        than Bossier City's 62,000, citing India's demographic trends and that "even
        smaller cities/towns in India typically exceed 60,000." The NO answer is based
        on Bari being larger, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final conclusion, indicating that Bossier City is not more populous
        than Bari, India. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    61b26fda-fcbc-4994-a4ef-ff5bbfe1d046:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "close"
        (Bossier City ~62,000 vs Bari ~60,000), it does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it states NO because there might be other "Bari,
        India" locations with higher populations. The model actually suggests Bossier
        City is "slightly more populous" than the Bari it identified, but says NO
        due to uncertainty about other possible Bari locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that Bossier City is not definitively more populous than
        all potential "Bari, India" locations. This is a direct comparative NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer

        possibilities throughout, it ultimately commits to a clear YES answer based
        on official census data.

        never gave a definitive NO answer, instead presenting multiple scenarios without
        reaching a conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        provides a clear YES/NO conclusion. It presents multiple scenarios with different
        population estimates and growth rates, ending with calculations showing different
        possibilities (Bari could be larger at 2% growth or smaller at 1% growth).

        its conclusion. The model arrives at this answer after comparing population
        figures of ~95k for Wadi al Hayaa vs ~79k for Grecia canton.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3d66b759-cd14-458b-b46d-e9a9eea2ccc9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Grecia canton
        (~80,000) has a larger population than Wadi al Hayaa (~50,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Grecia canton is more populous than Wadi al Hayaa
        District, providing specific population estimates to support this comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't even complete its analysis or make any equality comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-thought
        while discussing Grecia (canton). The model did not reach a conclusion or
        provide any YES/NO answer about the population comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    61cde9c6-1ae6-4461-969c-d4a1eb7d9d14:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows uncertainty about exact numbers,
        it concludes NO because it determines Grecia (~80K-85K) is likely more populous
        than Wadi al Hayaa (~50K-80K). The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly states "Grecia's population
        (~80K-85K) likely exceeds Wadi al Hayaa's (~50K-80K)".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through the comparison. This is a clear negative
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different population values (70,000 vs 77,000-80,000) and indicates Grecia
        is more populous. The NO is not because the values are equal, but because
        Grecia has a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms that
        Wadi al Hayaa is not more populous than Grecia canton, providing a clear comparative
        answer with population estimates to support its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aade7369-ee14-4b48-94f4-8728b057f2cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it didn't even finish gathering
        information about both locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence
        while still gathering information about Grecia (canton). The model never reaches
        a conclusion or provides a YES/NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b9a6ba4d-27b6-4976-b47f-e29210cb4f34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the historical populations
        were very close (76,858 vs 76,898), it explicitly states there are differences
        in the current populations, with Grecia being higher (80k-85k vs 76k-80k).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal "Answer: NO" conclusion.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Wadi al Hayaa
        is not more populous than Grecia).'

    bcf21ec3-2f82-4328-bd9c-f73d2154f014:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        Grecia canton (76,898-80,000) has a larger population than Wadi al Hayaa (53,628-60,000).
        The values are not equal or same - there is a clear difference in the populations,
        with Grecia being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Grecia canton has a larger population."

      result: 'NO'
    bfa91f1b-0092-486d-ab11-b801631cb2a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers,
        it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference,
        with Grecia having 77,000 people and Wadi al Hayaa having 50,000-75,000. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        is because Grecia canton (77,000) has a higher population than Wadi al Hayaa
        District (50,000-75,000). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fd809841-c6a8-4d46-a498-f6bfdc80686c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations might overlap
        in some ranges (70,000-80,000 vs 80,000-85,000), it does not base its NO answer
        on them being equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Grecia Canton's
        population "likely exceeds" Wadi al Hayaa's due to growth trends and more
        reliable data. Since it indicates a difference (even if potentially small),
        this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Wadi al
        Hayaa is not more populous than Grecia Canton.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations are close (9,210
        vs 9,000), it explicitly stated that Ventnor City "slightly exceeds" Troina's
        population. This small difference, not equality, was the basis for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that Ventnor City's population (~9,210) slightly
        exceeds Troina's (~9,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close ("marginally
        larger"), it explicitly states there is a difference (9,210 vs 9,000) and
        bases its NO answer on Ventnor City being larger, not on the values being
        equal. The model consistently maintains that Ventnor City has a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Ventnor City's population (9,210)
        is larger than Troina's (9,000).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ventnor City
        (9,210) is "slightly more populous" than Troina (8,900), showing a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly compares the populations, finding Ventnor City (9,210) to be
        more populous than Troina (8,900).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a6d765e-0444-4e3a-b1aa-cb24ee6ffac7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (9,500
        vs 9,000-9,200), it explicitly states there is a difference with Ventnor City
        being "slightly" more populous. The NO answer is based on this small but existing
        difference, not on the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit comparative conclusion that "Ventnor City, New Jersey, is
        more populous than Troina." The answer is definitive and comparative, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5d24b47f-fcae-49df-b840-d91edcdd6320:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, its final conclusion clearly states different population values (9,500
        vs 8,500) and indicates Troina is "less populous" than Ventnor City. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear comparative statement that Troina (8,500)
        is less populous than Ventnor City (9,500).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its
        analysis, stating that Troina (estimated 9,500) is more populous than Ventnor
        City (9,210). Despite expressing some uncertainty during its reasoning, it
        provides a clear final comparative answer of YES.

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("marginally larger", "slightly
        higher") and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with clear reasoning that Ventnor City has a larger population
        than Troina (9,210 vs 9,100).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (26,000 vs 103,000) and gave NO because Daviess County is more
        populous than Yuli County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are very close ("That's
        very close" and "the difference is marginal"), it explicitly states that Tando
        Muhammad Khan has a slightly higher population (677,228 vs. 676,598). The
        NO answer is based on this small difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with detailed reasoning comparing population figures,

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan (677,228)
        is "slightly larger" than Pathankot (676,598). Even though the difference
        is small, the model clearly indicates there is a difference, not equality,
        and this difference is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Pathankot is not more
        populous than Tando Muhammad Khan. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the tentative NO as final, the model explicitly notes different values (676k
        vs 677k) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO, Pathankot is not more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District
        based on the latest census data available." However, it then immediately questions
        this conclusion by mentioning the need to check for more recent estimates,
        ending mid-sentence with "If in". This makes the final answer unclear, as
        the model appears uncertain about its conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear affirmative answer that Pathankot district is more populous than Tando
        Muhammad Khan District. This was stated both in the thinking section and in
        the final structured answer.

        difference is small, the model clearly indicates there is a difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that

        did compare various population figures but never reached a final NO conclusion
        where equality was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model explores various
        population estimates and growth scenarios, it never arrives at a definitive
        answer. The last sentence trails off with "If that" and doesn't complete the
        thought.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), we must answer False to this question. Even if the model discussed equality
        of values at various points (around 580k for both regions), since there was
        no final NO answer, we cannot classify this as being about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The response shows significant back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a clear final answer. The model oscillates between YES and
        NO multiple times, with the last few statements contradicting each other:

        the answer is YES." The response ends mid-sentence without making a final
        determination. This lack of a clear conclusion means we should classify it

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Stalowa Wola (60,799)
        exceeds Pickaway County's population (58,539). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Pickaway County is not
        more populous than Stalowa Wola. The model provides specific population numbers
        and makes a direct comparison showing Stalowa Wola has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Stalowa Wola has
        about 2,000 more residents than Pickaway County, not because the values are
        equal. It explicitly states the difference in populations (58,500 vs 60,800)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        it explicitly states there is a difference (Stalowa Wola at 63,000 vs Pickaway
        at 58,000) and describes Stalowa Wola as "slightly more populous." The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Stalowa Wola (63,000) is more populous than

        (58,457 vs 61,043), it explicitly states there is a difference of "roughly
        2,500 people" between them. The NO answer is based on Stalowa Wola being "slightly
        larger" than Pickaway County, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Stalowa Wola
        has a higher population than Pickaway County. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        a higher population (61,543) than Pickaway County (58,539). The NO answer
        was given because Stalowa Wola is more populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        Pickaway County is not more populous than Stalowa Wola because Stalowa Wola
        has a higher population).

        is a difference between them ("Stalowa Wola has a slightly higher population
        than Pickaway County"). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer
        section. This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that Pickaway

        explicitly states that Yulin is "slightly higher" and "slightly more populous."
        The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on the values being equal.
        Since any difference, even if described as "slight," means the values are
        not equal, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the thinking section and in its formal conclusion. This NO is given

        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it discusses uncertainty about the exact
        nature of Mong and provides population figures that differ (Namsai at ~95,950
        vs various possibilities for Mong). The NO answer appears to come from this
        analysis rather than from equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The model never
        reached a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were
        the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps alternating between different
        possibilities and calculations, ending mid-thought while discussing populations
        (91,800 vs 76,000). Without a definitive comparative statement or final answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (95,000 vs 200,000) and concluded NO because Riffa is more populous
        than Maharagama. The values were clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Maharagama (95,000) is less populous than Riffa
        (200,000). This is a direct comparative answer.

        a difference in values, even though small, this does not qualify as stating
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Maharagama is not more populous than Riffa, providing

        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not claim the values
        are equal or the same, but rather identifies a small but definite difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with reasoning that Riffa (200,000) is slightly more populous than Maharagama
        (196,423). The answer is clearly stated and comparative.

        vs 13,579), it clearly states there is a difference with Shuanghu being "more
        populous" and "slightly more populous." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in bold and supported by comparative population figures showing Shuanghu

        (14,000) than Little Hulton (13,000). The values are not equal - there is
        an explicit difference noted, even if small. The NO is because one value is
        larger than the other, not because they are equal.

        a slightly higher population") and this difference, not equality, is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model never claims the values are equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

        we considered the model's speculation about similar populations (~38,000 for
        both), it never used this as justification for a NO answer since it never
        gave a definitive NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer about whether Pontotoc County
        has a higher population than Defiance County. It ends with uncertainty, suggesting
        approximate populations ("maybe Defiance has around 39,000 and Pontotoc a
        bit less") but doesn't make a final comparative judgment.

        ("almost the same"), it explicitly states that Defiance County has a slightly
        higher population (38,286 vs 38,065, a difference of 221 people). The NO answer
        is based on this small but explicit difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Pontotoc County does
        not have a larger population than Defiance County. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

        for both counties), it never explicitly states they are equal nor uses equality
        as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its thought process but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It spends time trying to recall population
        figures for both counties but expresses uncertainty throughout ("maybe," "I
        think," "I'm not certain") and ends mid-thought without making a final comparison

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of Moweaqua (~1,842) and Balcombe (~1,763), stating that since
        Moweaqua's population exceeds Balcombe's, the answer is "YES".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that Moweaqua (1,831)
        is more populous than Balcombe (1,776).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the difference is "minimal"
        and "marginal," it explicitly states there is a difference of 3 people (1,834
        vs 1,831). The NO answer is based on Balcombe being larger than Moweaqua,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, explaining that Balcombe (1,834) is more
        populous than Moweaqua (1,831) based on census data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "roughly
        similar," it explicitly states that Qabala has a "slightly higher population"
        and is "marginally more populous," giving specific different ranges. The NO
        answer is based on this small difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative statement that Qabala is marginally more populous than
        Ziro, with specific population ranges given (12,000-13,000 vs 13,000-13,500).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares similar numbers (12,000 vs
        13,000), it explicitly states that Qabala is "slightly more populous" and
        cites this difference as the reason for the NO answer. Since there is an explicit
        difference noted, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Qabala is slightly more
        populous than Ziro, with specific population numbers (12,000 vs 13,000) to
        support this conclusion.

        for Ziro vs 13,000-14,000 for Qabala), it did not state they were equal. Instead,
        it explicitly stated that "Qabala likely edges out Ziro in population" as
        the reason for the NO answer, indicating a difference in values, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and reaffirmed
        this in its final summary, stating that Qabala likely edges out Ziro in population.
        The answer was clearly stated as a comparative result.

        it explicitly states that Qabala is "slightly more populous" with 13,000 residents
        compared to Ziro's 12,289. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Qabala is slightly more populous than Ziro, with

        (12,589 vs 12,602), it explicitly states that Qabala is "slightly more populous"
        and bases its NO answer on this small difference, not on equality. The model
        consistently maintains throughout that Qabala has a slightly higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, presenting it as a clear comparative conclusion based
        on population figures.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (12,589 vs 13,000),
        the model explicitly states that Qabala has a "slightly higher population
        than Ziro" and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Since
        the model identifies a difference rather than equality, even though small,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ziro is not more populous
        than Qabala" as its final answer, providing specific population estimates
        to support this conclusion (Ziro ~12,589 vs Qabala ~13,000).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population ranges (13,000-15,000
        for Ziro vs 20,000-25,000 for Qabala) and concludes NO because Qabala has
        a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population ranges to support its conclusion
        that Qabala is more populous than Ziro.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (12,975
        vs 13,800), it explicitly states that "Qabala's population is slightly higher"
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. Since there is an
        explicit difference noted, even though small, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        specific population numbers to support this answer (12,975 for Ziro vs 13,800
        for Qabala). The answer is clear and definitive.

    f24901a9-bb6b-4f34-b7df-b3a2ca2c5ad1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Qabala's population appears slightly larger"
        and gives different ranges for each city (12,000-15,000 for Ziro vs 13,000-20,000
        for Qabala). The NO answer is based on Qabala being larger, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a clear comparative conclusion
        that Ziro is not more populous than Qabala.

        (12,000-12,500 for Ziro vs 12,800-13,500 for Qabala), it explicitly states
        there is a difference with Qabala being "slightly more populous." The NO answer
        is based on this small but existing difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once at the
        end of the thinking section and again in the final statement. It provides
        a direct comparative answer that Qabala is slightly more populous than Ziro,
        with specific population ranges given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of around 40,000 people, with Hardin County having 110,702 people compared
        to Zenica's 70,553.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparison showing Hardin County has a larger
        population than Zenica (110,702 vs 70,553).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference of 30,000-40,000 people
        between the two locations, with Hardin County having the larger population.
        This difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion, stating that Hardin County's
        population exceeds Zenica's by roughly 30,000-40,000.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the municipality of Zenica
        (110,000) and Hardin County (111,475) are "roughly similar," this wasn't the
        reason for the NO answer. The model's NO was based on comparing Zenica city
        proper (70,000) to Hardin County (111,475), which shows a clear difference
        in population. The model even notes that Hardin County "edges slightly higher"
        even when comparing the municipality numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Zenica is not more populous than Hardin County,
        Kentucky. This was a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (Zenica
        ~70,000 vs Hardin County ~110,000) and concludes NO because Hardin County
        has a larger population. The values are different, not equal.

        states there is a difference in populations (Hardin County exceeds Zenica's
        by 35,000-40,000). The NO is based on this difference, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that Hardin

        it states there is a clear difference between these values and uses this difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. The values are explicitly
        stated to be unequal with Hardin County having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that Zenica

        answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" followed by an explanation
        that Zenica (70,000-75,000) has a lower population than Hardin County (110,000).
        This is a clear NO answer to whether Zenica is more populous than Hardin County.

        are very close (110,663 vs 110,702), it does not use this equality as the
        primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it bases its NO primarily on comparing
        Zenica's city proper (70,553) to Hardin County (110,702), finding a clear
        difference. Even when considering the municipal numbers, it notes Zenica is
        "marginally smaller" than Hardin County, indicating a difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Zenica is not more populous than
        Hardin County, Kentucky." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, its final NO answer is based on a difference in populations (Cisarua
        "around 100,000 or less" vs Gama "approximately 127,000"). The values are
        not equal, and the NO is based on Gama being larger, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Gama is more populous than Cisarua." The answer
        is a direct comparative response to whether Cisarua is more populous than
        Gama.

        for both places, it explicitly states that Clermont's population (43,021)
        is "slightly higher" than Delaware County's (40,397). Since the model identifies
        a difference in values rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. It explicitly stated the difference and explained that
        Clermont was "already higher" and the gap was likely "widening" due to growth
        trends.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        in population (Siano ~3,000 vs Blandford Forum ~10,000-11,000) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference in populations, with Blandford Forum being larger (10,600) than
        Siano (3,200). The model describes this as "significantly larger" and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on population numbers it provided
        (Siano ~3,200 vs Blandford Forum ~10,600). The answer is explicitly stated

        is more populous. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather due to a clear
        difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Siano (3,000) is

        its reasoning, it ultimately concludes NO because Bramhope (3,471) is slightly
        more populous than Tomahawk (3,346). The values are explicitly different,
        not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Tomahawk is not more
        populous than Bramhope. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows some uncertainty in its reasoning
        process, its final conclusion explicitly states a difference in values (3,300
        vs 3,500), with Bramhope being "slightly more populous." Since it identifies
        a difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Bramhope (3,500) is slightly more populous than
        Tomahawk (3,300)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Bramhope has a "slightly higher population
        than Tomahawk" (3,500-3,600 vs 3,346). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Tomahawk is not more populous than Bramhope.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

    b7153ae4-ec43-4a68-a570-8bc854b11953:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        for both places, it explicitly states that Bramhope (3,528) is "slightly more
        populous" than Tomahawk (3,346). Since the values are different and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures, indicating that Bramhope (3,528)
        is more populous than Tomahawk (3,346).

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (3,346 vs 3,382), the model
        explicitly states that "Bramhope is slightly more populous" and "Bramhope
        is a bit larger." The NO answer is based on Bramhope being larger than Tomahawk,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, explaining that Bramhope (3,382) is slightly more
        populous than Tomahawk (3,346).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bramhope (3,382) is "slightly
        more populous" than Tomahawk (3,346). Even though the difference is small,
        the model clearly indicates there is a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures showing Bramhope (3,382) being slightly
        larger than Tomahawk (3,346).

    f40a193d-9281-43fb-9f53-a690bae362b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares very close numbers (3,346
        vs 3,382), it explicitly states that Bramhope has a "marginally higher population"
        and is "slightly larger" than Tomahawk. The NO answer is based on this small
        difference, not on the values being equal or the same. Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not equal, this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Tomahawk
        (3,346) is not more populous than Bramhope (3,382). This is a direct comparative
        answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer stating "YES, Fayette County, Texas is more populous
        than Qabatiya." This was reinforced in the step-by-step explanation and final
        answer section.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the populations carefully,
        it explicitly states there is a difference between them (Qabatiya ~26,000
        vs Fayette County ~24,400). The NO answer is given because Qabatiya has a
        larger population, not because the values are equal. The model specifically
        notes that "Qabatiya's population (~26,000) exceeds Fayette County's (~24,400)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on population
        numbers (Qabatiya being more populous than Fayette County). The answer is
        definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Barabanki's. The NO answer is based on Enugu being larger, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states that Enugu State (4.4-5.1 million)
        is more populous than Barabanki (3.6 million). The model clearly indicates
        a difference in values, with Enugu State having a larger population, which
        is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking process and in the final formatted response.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative answer to whether Barabanki is more
        populous than Enugu State.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (10,358 vs 18,500) and explicitly stating that Rutigliano is more populous.
        The values are not equal or approximately equal, and the NO is based on Rutigliano
        being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        specific population numbers showing Rutigliano (18,500) is more populous than
        Futog (10,358). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    2769a31b-0bac-4129-affe-55f749100fba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        for both locations (211,000 vs 222,000), it does not state they are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Yonghe District is more populous, with
        a higher population (around 220k-230k) than Governador Island (210k-215k).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in populations, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Governador Island is
        not more populous than Yonghe District. The model provides specific population
        numbers and reaches a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        for both locations (211,000 vs 230,000-240,000), it states NO because Yonghe
        has a higher population, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        notes a difference in populations, with Yonghe having more people than Governador
        Island.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Governador Island is not more populous
        than Yonghe District. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        values (211,000 vs 222,000) and explicitly states that Yonghe District is
        more populous. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one location
        has a larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explains that Governador Island is less populous than Yonghe District,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

        it explicitly states that Yonghe District (222,000) has a "slightly higher
        population" than Governador Island (211,000). This difference, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly frames it as a comparative conclusion, stating that Yonghe
        District has a higher population than Governador Island.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (211,000 for Governador Island vs 222,000 for Yonghe District), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that Yonghe District's
        population exceeds Governador Island's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that Governador Island is not
        more populous than Yonghe District. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

    7a2ae793-144f-4759-82ce-ba6caeddbbf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares similar population numbers
        (211,000 vs 222,000), it explicitly states that Yonghe District has a "slightly
        higher population" than Governador Island. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal. Even though the difference
        is small, any stated difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that Governador
        Island is not more populous than Yonghe District.'

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Yonghe District
        (222,000) has a higher population than Governador Island (211,000), showing
        a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with explicit reasoning steps showing Yonghe District
        (222,000) has a higher population than Governador Island (211,000).

        District (~222,500) has a higher population than Governador Island (~211,000).
        The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that Governador Island is not
        more populous than Yonghe District. This is a direct comparative NO answer
        based on population figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        different population values (211,000 vs 222,500) and explicitly states that
        Yonghe has a higher population. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather
        on a clear difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct numerical comparison showing Governador
        Island (211,000) has fewer people than Yonghe District (222,500).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (Morrelganj at ~186,000-200,000 vs Ragusa at ~320,000) and concluded
        NO because Ragusa has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population estimates, indicating Ragusa Province (320,000)

        (318,000) to be more populous than Morrelganj (250,000). It explicitly states
        different values and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (270,000-280,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and supports this with population figures showing Ragusa (318,000)
        is more populous than Morrelganj (270,000-280,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are very close
        (around 318,000 for both at one point), it ultimately concludes that Ragusa's
        population is "marginally higher" (318,000-320,000) than Morrelganj's (315,000-318,000).
        The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on the values being equal.
        Even when discussing the possibility of them being "almost equal," the model
        still maintains that Ragusa is slightly more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with structured reasoning steps that conclude "Morrelganj
        is not more populous than Ragusa." The answer is clearly stated as a comparative
        result.

        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Morrelganj Upazila is not more populous than the
        Province of Ragusa, supported by specific population estimates (222,600 growing

        more populous" than Morrelganj (311,000). While the model discusses some scenarios
        where the values might be close or equal, its final conclusion is based on
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different values for the populations and bases its NO answer on Davyd-Haradok
        having a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and presents it as a clear comparative conclusion based on population figures
        it recalled, not as a refusal or inability to determine.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Fulton,
        Maryland is significantly more populous than Davyd-Haradok." The answer is
        clearly stated and directional.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value
        (5,748) exceeds the other (4,520), and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct numerical comparison showing Davyd-Haradok
        (5,748) is more populous than Fulton (4,520).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Davyd-Haradok's population (6,300) is
        "significantly larger" than Fulton's (2,500). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer based

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population ranges,
        it does not state the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Davyd-Haradok's population (5,500-6,000) exceeds Fulton's estimated range
        (2,000-4,500), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing population ranges and clearly stating that since
        Davyd-Haradok's population exceeds Fulton's estimated range, the answer is
        "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population sizes, with Davyd-Haradok (6,300) being more populous than Fulton
        (2,049).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparative conclusion that Fulton, Maryland (2,049
        people) is less populous than Davyd-Haradok (6,300 people).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Toton's population is likely smaller than
        Corning's (Corning at 7,663 and Toton estimated at 5,000-7,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after the step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative conclusion
        that Toton is not more populous than Corning, California.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the numbers are "really close"
        and "the numbers are tricky," it explicitly states there is a difference in
        population (Toton ~7,500 vs Corning 7,863) and concludes that "Corning has
        a marginally higher population than Toton." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Toton is not more populous
        than Corning, California. The model provides specific population numbers and
        reaches a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criterion only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response was cut off mid-sentence, but in the
        preceding detailed analysis, the model explicitly concluded "Let's go with
        the conclusion that Toton, UK has a higher population than Corning, CA. So
        answer YES." This represents a clear final comparative answer.

        - in fact, it explicitly gives different values (Toton ~6,500 vs Corning ~7,800)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based
        on Corning being larger than Toton, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, both
        in the thinking section and in the final answer, concluding that Toton is
        not more populous than Corning, California. This is a direct comparative NO
        answer.

        both places, it explicitly states that Corning is "slightly larger" with approximately
        8,000-8,500 residents compared to Toton's 7,000-8,000 residents. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times,

        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Toton (estimated 5,000-7,000)
        is smaller than Corning (7,863). The model concludes "Since Toton's population
        (as a village) is likely under 7,863, Corning is more populous." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in populations (3,000 vs 6,360), not because the values are equal. Even when
        considering potential growth, the model maintains that Balerno remains more
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population comparisons showing Waterford has a smaller

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Balerno (6,370)
        is MORE populous than Waterford (2,896), not because they are equal. The model
        explicitly states the difference in values and concludes "Balerno is more
        populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Balerno is more populous than Waterford, with
        specific population numbers (2,896 vs 6,370)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly states different
        values (3,522 vs 6,400) and uses this difference to conclude that "Balerno
        remains more populous." The NO answer is based on Balerno being larger, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures showing Waterford (3,522) is less
        populous than Balerno (6,400). This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        population values (Waterford ~4,100 vs Balerno ~6,370) and explicitly states
        that Balerno has a larger population. The NO is not due to equal values, but
        rather because one location has a clearly larger population than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Waterford is not more populous than Balerno,
        providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

        de Azueta (136,491) is more populous than Port Louis District (119,706), and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
