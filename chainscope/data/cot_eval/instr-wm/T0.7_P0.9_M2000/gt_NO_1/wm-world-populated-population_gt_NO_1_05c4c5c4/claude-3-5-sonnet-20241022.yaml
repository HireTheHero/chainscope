      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (1.58 million vs
        2.55 million) and states NO because one value is greater than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Kalahandi district is not more populous than Nizamabad district. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (1.58 million vs 2.55 million) and NO was given because Kalahandi
        has a smaller population than Nizamabad.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Kalahandi is not more populous than Nizamabad, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (1.58
        million vs 2.55 million) and concludes NO because Nizamabad has a larger population
        than Kalahandi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Kalahandi district is
        not more populous than Nizamabad district" as its final comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Vhembe (1.4M) has
        a larger population than Katni (1.3M), and this difference is why it answered
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and determining that Vhembe has
        a larger population than Katni.

    4ad4dd6c-b9bf-470f-9419-e9877c82cd4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly shows they are different (1.3 million vs 1.4
        million) and uses the < symbol to indicate Katni has a lower population than
        Vhembe. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Katni district is not
        more populous than Vhembe District Municipality)" as its final comparative
        conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the values numerically, it
        does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Vhembe's
        1.4M is greater than Katni's 1.3M. The NO answer is given because Vhembe is
        larger, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Katni district is
        not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality)" as its final comparative
        answer, after showing that Vhembe (1.4M) is larger than Katni (1.3M)

    7635ccd6-72e1-4830-b7bf-213363aeee5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (1.3M vs 1.4M), the model
        explicitly notes a difference between them and states NO because Vhembe is
        larger, not because they are equal. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Katni district is
        not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality)" as its final comparative
        conclusion after showing that Vhembe (1.4M) > Katni (1.3M)

    7895de8f-9ace-46d9-aebe-0201f51a466b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population values,
        it shows that they are different (1.3 million vs 1.4 million) and explicitly
        states that 1.4 million > 1.3 million. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Katni district is not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (1.3M
        vs 1.4M) and concludes NO because Katni has fewer people than Vhembe, not
        because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Katni (1.3M) has fewer people
        than Vhembe (1.4M)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Vhembe (1.4M) is larger
        than Katni (1.3M), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Katni district is not more populous than Vhembe District Municipality,

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly stated different values (1.3M vs
        1.4M) and gave NO because Katni is less populous, not because the values are
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Katni district (1.3M) is less populous than

        vs 1.4 million) and states "1.4 million > 1.3 million" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final answer, indicating that Katni district is not more populous than
        Vhembe District Municipality. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides approximate numbers (~47,000
        vs ~50,000), it explicitly states there is a difference between them (47,000
        < 50,000) and does not claim they are equal. The NO answer is based on Tioga
        County having a smaller population than Gosen, not on them being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Tioga County is not
        more populous than Gosen)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative
        result with numerical evidence (47,000 < 50,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows they are different (50,000 vs 48,455) and uses this difference (not
        equality) as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Gosen is larger,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Tioga County is not
        more populous than Gosen)" as its final comparative conclusion after showing
        that Gosen's population (50,000) is larger than Tioga County's (48,455).

        vs 50,000) and states that 50,000 > 48,455, indicating the NO is because Gosen
        is larger, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Tioga

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (48,455 vs
        50,000), it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        shows they are different with "50,000 > 48,455". The NO answer is given because
        Gosen has a larger population, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Tioga County is not
        more populous than Gosen)" as its final answer after comparing the populations.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (23,000 vs 103,000) and stated that "Daviess County has significantly
        more people than Yuli County".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Yuli County is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly showed different values (108,000 vs 103,000) and noted
        they were different (108,000 > 103,000). The fact that its NO answer contradicted
        its own data is irrelevant to this classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it later noted this contradicted its own data. Since we're
        instructed to analyze what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions,
        the final answer was NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the population values are close (676,598 vs
        677,228), the model explicitly shows that they are different numbers and uses
        this difference (677,228 > 676,598) as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        are not stated to be equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Pathankot district is not more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District,

      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are close (676,000 vs 677,000),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference and indicates Tando Muhammad
        Khan District is greater than Pathankot district. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Pathankot district
        is not more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District" as its final comparative
        conclusion, providing a direct NO answer to whether Pathankot is more populous.

        it explicitly states that Tando Muhammad Khan District has a "slightly larger
        recorded population" (677,228 > 676,598). Since the model identifies a difference
        in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Pathankot district is not more populous than Tando Muhammad Khan District".

        stated there was a difference ("Tando Muhammad Khan District has a slightly
        larger population than Pathankot district") rather than stating they were
        equal. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Tando Muhammad Khan District to be slightly larger
        than Pathankot district.

        Khuzdar District has "fewer people" than Quetzaltenango Department. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Khuzdar District is not more populous than Quetzaltenango Department.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different values (800,000 vs 900,000) and
        indicates that Quetzaltenango is larger (900,000 > 800,000). The NO is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Khuzdar District is NOT more populous than
        Quetzaltenango Department." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the numbers are "close," it
        explicitly states Khuzdar District "appears to have a slightly larger population"
        before giving its NO answer. The presence of any difference, even if described
        as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Khuzdar District
        is not more populous than Quetzaltenango Department" as its final comparative
        answer, though this contradicts its earlier reasoning that "Khuzdar District
        appears to have a slightly larger population".

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Gharm is not more
        populous than Aveley)" as its final comparative answer after showing that

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (1,500 vs 1,600) and uses the less than symbol (<) to indicate Tourouvre has
        a smaller population than Lumarzo. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (1,500 < 1,600) and used this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        people" and gives different ranges (110,000 vs 110,000-115,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Zenica is not more
        populous than Hardin County, Kentucky)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that Hardin County was "slightly larger" than Zenica,
        which was the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Hardin County to be slightly larger

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it notes that Hardin County has "slightly more people" with a range of 110,000-115,000
        compared to Zenica's 110,000. This difference, even though small, means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Zenica is not more
        populous than Hardin County, Kentucky)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in populations (120,000 vs 3 million), not because the values were
        equal

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gama has more than
        twice the population of Cisarua, showing a clear difference in values rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the Federal District is "much larger"
        and provides different population figures (150,000-200,000 vs 3,000,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Cisarua is not more populous than Gama, Federal District. This is a direct
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - in fact, it explicitly states that "the Federal District population is many
        times larger" than Cisarua's population
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Cisarua is not more populous than the Federal

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly gives different population values
        (Cisarua ~120,000 vs Gama ~140,000) and bases its NO answer on Gama being
        larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Cisarua is not more
        populous than Gama, Federal District)" as its final answer, making a direct
        comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b6e08da3-7139-48b3-b452-0bd5637ace88:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does discuss
        overlapping ranges, this is irrelevant since the question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and "I cannot make a confident YES/NO determination." This
        is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to uncertainty in the
        data.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different population values
        (150,000 vs over 3 million) and concluded NO because one was larger than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Cisarua is not more populous
        than the Federal District.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient data about one of the locations. This
        indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to engage
        with the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually notes that "Bramhope appears to be slightly larger" and gives
        specific different ranges (3,000-3,500 vs 3,400). While the values are close,
        the model explicitly notes a difference rather than equality.

        it explicitly stated that "Bramhope appears to be slightly larger" and gave
        ranges that weren't exactly equal (3,000-3,500 vs 3,400). Since it identified
        a difference in values, even though small, this doesn't qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Tomahawk,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close"
        and "within margin of error," it still makes a distinction and bases its NO
        answer on "typical recent estimates" suggesting Bramhope has a slightly higher
        population (3,400 vs 3,000-3,500 range for Tomahawk). The NO is not based
        on them being exactly equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference,
        stating that Zurmi "likely has several hundred thousand inhabitants" while
        Chibombo has "around 100,000" and concluded Zurmi is "very likely more populous."
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Chibombo District
        is not more populous than Zurmi)" as its final comparative answer. This is
        a clear NO response to whether Chibombo District is more populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Zurmi has a "significantly
        larger population" than Chibombo District (250,000+ vs 100,000-150,000). The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Zurmi has a larger population than Chibombo
        District. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly shows
        that the values are different (17,800 vs 24,000) and states "17,800 < 24,000".
        The NO is based on this inequality, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        definitively answering that Piran is not more populous than Mollendo. It provides
        specific population numbers and makes a clear comparison showing 17,800 <
        24,000.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (Piran
        ~17,000-18,000 vs Mollendo ~24,000) and indicates NO because Mollendo's population
        is greater, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Municipality of Piran
        is not more populous than Mollendo" as its final comparative conclusion after
        analyzing the populations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the populations are
        different (17,800 vs 24,000) and that Mollendo has more people than Municipality
        of Piran.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Municipality of Piran is not more populous than Mollendo, providing a
        direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (17,800
        vs 24,000) and stated that one was greater than the other (24,000 > 17,800).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        with an explicit explanation that Piran is not more populous than Mollendo,
        providing a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (Mollendo
        at 24,000 > Piran at 17,000-18,000) and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly explains
        that "Municipality of Piran is not more populous than Mollendo." This is a
        direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (Mollendo ~24,000 vs Piran ~17,000-18,000) and concludes NO
        because Mollendo is larger, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Mollendo has a larger population

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Mollendo (24,000) is greater than Piran (17,000-18,000), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly notes this difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Piran is not more populous than Mollendo, providing

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model clearly states different
        population values (22,000 vs 13,000), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives contradictory answers - first saying
        "NO, Comacchio IS more populous" and then "The answer is: YES". Since these
        directly conflict and there''s no clear final stance, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the specific values (22,000
        vs 35,000), it gives NO because they are different (22,000 < 35,000), not
        because they are equal. The values are explicitly stated to be unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Comacchio is not more
        populous than Clifton, Bristol" as its final comparative answer after showing

        explicitly states that Vanderburgh County has "slightly more people" (180,000-185,000
        vs 180,000). This small difference, rather than equality, is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" when asked
        if Suyeong District is more populous than Vanderburgh County, providing a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it concludes that Bonao has a larger population than Bhagawangola
        II. The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Bhagawangola II is
        not more populous than Bonao)" as its final comparative answer
      final_answer: 'NO'
