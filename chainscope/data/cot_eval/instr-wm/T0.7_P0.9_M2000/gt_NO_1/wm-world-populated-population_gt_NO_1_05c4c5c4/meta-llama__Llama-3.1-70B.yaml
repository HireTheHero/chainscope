      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different population values
        (1,576,869 vs 2,552,073) and states that "Nizamabad district has a higher
        population compared to Kalahandi district." The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad
        district, providing specific population numbers showing Nizamabad has a higher
        population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Nizamabad
        (2,551,335) has a larger population than Kalahandi (1,573,054), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad
        district, after comparing their populations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (1,576,869 vs 2,551,335) and stated that "Nizamabad district had a
        higher population" compared to Kalahandi district.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Nizamabad (2,551,335)
        has a larger population than Kalahandi (1,576,869), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values and bases
        its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kalahandi district is more populous than Nizamabad

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it shows different population values (1,576,869
        vs 2,551,335) and the NO is because Nizamabad has a larger population than
        Kalahandi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Kalahandi is more populous than Nizamabad, providing
        specific population numbers showing Nizamabad has a larger population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        The NO answer appears to be given despite acknowledging uncertainty about
        the precise figures, rather than because the values are equal. The model notes
        both districts have "substantial populations" but doesn't claim they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because Nizamabad
        (2,551,335) has a larger population than Kalahandi (1,573,054), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, providing a direct comparative answer to
        whether Kalahandi is more populous than Nizamabad.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides similar population numbers
        (1,291,684 vs 1,294,722), it does not explicitly state that they are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it shows that Vhembe has a slightly larger population, making this
        a comparison where there is a difference, albeit small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Katni district is more populous than Vhembe District Municipality,
        providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

    147f0579-2a08-4e03-baca-ddcd72b07708:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        that are close (1,291,684 vs 1,294,722), it does not explicitly state that
        they are equal/same/identical. Instead, it shows that Vhembe actually has
        a slightly larger population, making this a case of one value being larger
        than the other, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Katni district is more populous than Vhembe District Municipality,
        providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

    5a63feed-4052-47ae-9e03-a6530653b46c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (1,291,684 vs 1,294,722), it explicitly states that "Vhembe District Municipality
        has a slightly larger population than Katni district." Since it identifies
        a difference (even though small), rather than stating the populations are
        equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Katni district is more populous than Vhembe District Municipality.
        The answer is clear and direct.

    7c6029bc-4eda-43af-a99a-721d37b5134b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the values are close (1,292,042
        vs 1,294,722), it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same.
        In fact, it shows a small but clear difference in the values, with Vhembe
        having a slightly larger population. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing population data for both districts.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        that are close (1,292,042 vs 1,294,722), it does not explicitly state that
        they are equal/same/identical. In fact, it shows a clear difference with Vhembe
        having a slightly larger population. The NO answer appears to be because Vhembe
        has more people, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Katni district is more populous than Vhembe District Municipality.
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        that are very close (1,292,042 vs 1,294,722), it does not explicitly state
        that they are equal/same/identical. Instead, it shows that Vhembe has a slightly
        larger population, making this a case of different values, even if the difference
        is small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the model does not explicitly state they are equal/same/identical. Instead,
        it shows that Vhembe has a slightly larger population, which is the reason
        for the NO answer. Even small differences disqualify this from being classified
        as equal values.

        50,000" vs "around 55,000"), it clearly indicates a difference in population
        sizes, with Columbus County having about 5,000 more people. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing the populations, based on its analysis showing
        Columbus County (55,000) having a larger population than Bheemunipatnam (50,000).

        population than Columbus County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bheemunipatnam is more populous than Columbus County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Grecia
        (76,898) to be more populous than Wadi al Hayaa District (72,587). It did
        not state the populations were equal - in fact, it explicitly showed they
        were different - so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wadi al Hayaa District is more populous than Grecia (canton), providing
        specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different population values
        (72,587 vs 76,898) and bases its NO answer on Grecia Canton having a larger
        population. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it suggests that Ventnor City is likely larger than Troina.
        The NO answer is based on the model's reasoning that Ventnor City would be
        more populous than Troina, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        vs 9,210), the model identifies a specific difference in population numbers
        and does not state they are equal/same/identical. The NO answer is based on
        Troina having a smaller population (9,000) than Ventnor City (9,210), not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (9,000 vs 9,210) and explicitly concludes
        "the answer to whether Troina is more populous than Ventnor City, New Jersey

        the model shows a small difference with Ventnor City having 10 more people.
        The model does not state that the populations are equal/same/identical, and
        the NO answer appears to be based on Troina having slightly fewer people,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Troina is more populous than Ventnor City, providing specific

        the model shows a small difference between them rather than stating they are
        equal. The NO answer is based on Troina having a slightly smaller population,
        not because the values are the same.

        answer and explains that "it's not possible to determine with certainty whether
        Turweston is more populous than Barmedman." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        Barmedman (225) has a larger population than Turweston (160), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states different values for the populations
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (160 vs 225 people) and explicitly frames
        this as the answer to whether Turweston is more populous than Barmedman.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8edb061d-6583-4821-bf50-6ce8dce18e6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal - it explicitly shows different population values (140 for Turweston
        vs 235 for Barmedman). The NO is because Turweston has a smaller population,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Turweston is more populous than Barmedman, providing specific
        population numbers (140 vs 235) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it shows that the
        populations are different (180 vs 200), not equal. The NO is based on Turweston
        having a smaller population than Barmedman, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Turweston is more populous than Barmedman, providing specific
        population numbers (180 vs 200) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated different
        population values (134 for Turweston vs 198 for Barmedman). The NO was based
        on Turweston having a smaller population than Barmedman, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Turweston is more populous than Barmedman, providing specific
        population numbers (134 vs 198) to support this conclusion.

    ef734da5-aa63-4654-b531-891d254a2013:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (151 vs
        202) and the NO answer is based on this difference (Turweston being smaller),
        not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (151 vs 202) and explicitly concludes "the
        answer to whether Turweston is more populous than Barmedman is NO"

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (300 vs 208).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating that Turweston (300 people) is more populous than Barmedman
        (208 people).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the populations are close (211
        vs 218), it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical/the same. Instead,
        it shows that Barmedman has a slightly larger population, making this a comparison
        of different values rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Turweston is more populous than Barmedman, providing a clear
        comparative result.

        (685,559 vs 677,098).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations of both districts (685,559 vs 677,098) and finding Pathankot
        district to be more populous.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows two very close values (676,355
        vs 677,098), it does not explicitly state that they are equal or the same.
        In fact, it shows a small but clear numerical difference between them, with
        Tando Muhammad Khan District having a slightly larger population. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Pathankot district is more populous than Tando Muhammad
        Khan District. This is a clear comparative result.

        never claimed the populations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        which was larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and explains that it cannot determine which district is more
        populous without precise population data. This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different population
        values (7,400 vs 9,800) and uses this difference to conclude that Beerwah
        is not more populous than Govindgarh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Beerwah is more populous than Govindgarh, and provides specific
        population numbers to support this comparative conclusion (7,400 vs 9,800).

        (6,193 vs 12,094) and bases its NO answer on Beerwah having a smaller population
        than Govindgarh. The values are not equal/same/identical, and equality is
        not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        In fact, it shows a difference in population (Lumarzo being slightly larger),
        which is why it gave the NO answer. Therefore, the NO answer was not due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the basis for its NO answer. The populations are described as being the same
        value (1,500), with no mention of any difference between them, and this equality
        is the explicit reason for the NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have "similar
        population sizes" and are "approximately equal in population" (around 1,500
        people each), and this equality is presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the values,
        only their approximate equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes some uncertainty in the comparison. Since it does
        provide this clear NO answer (not refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

        populations" and gives the same approximate range (1,500 to 2,000 people)
        for both. The NO answer appears to be based on this equality, as no differences
        in population are mentioned. The model presents their equal population ranges

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both places are likely small,
        it never explicitly states they have equal or identical populations. The NO
        answer appears to be based on general reasoning about small administrative
        divisions rather than a claim of equal values. Since equality is not explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.

        but couldn't determine for sure.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this answer with uncertainty ("challenging to make a
        definitive comparison", "speculative without exact numbers", "cautious answer").
        The model explicitly states it lacks precise data for Lumarzo and can't make
        a definitive comparison. This indicates inability to determine rather than
        a clear comparative result.

        a difference in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Pontotoc County is more populous than Defiance County,
        providing specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (38,065 vs 38,286),
        the model shows a clear difference between them and does not state they are
        equal/same/identical. The NO answer is based on Pontotoc having a smaller
        population than Defiance, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of both counties, with no ambiguity or qualification
        about its ability to make the determination.

        Instead, it explicitly states that Defiance County "has a slightly larger
        population than Pontotoc County" (38,286 vs 38,065), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Defiance County to be larger than
        Pontotoc County.

        person than Moweaqua, and this difference, though tiny, means the values are
        not identical. The NO answer was given because Moweaqua has a smaller population,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gama has a "much
        larger population" and "significantly larger population" than Cisarua, providing
        different population ranges for each location
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cisarua is more populous than Gama, and provides population
        figures showing Gama has a larger population (130,000-140,000 vs 30,000-40,000)

      result: 'NO'
    26413db6-dfdf-499b-a611-22f4695209aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Gama is likely
        larger than Cisarua (cities tend to be more populous than towns, and Gama
        has a known population of 127,121). The model indicates a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that Cisarua is not more populous than Gama,
        Federal District. While the model acknowledges some uncertainty in the data,
        it still provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (5,000
        vs 127,121) and based its NO answer on Gama having a larger population than
        Cisarua.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Cisarua (5,000 people) is not more
        populous than Gama (127,121 people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Gama (131,000)
        has a larger population than Cisarua (71,000), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly shows different population values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        larger population. It does not state the values are equal or the same - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (110,000 vs 127,121) and explicitly concludes

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they might be different
        but couldn't determine this with certainty.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        it heavily qualifies this by stating it's "speculative" and based on incomplete
        information, noting it's "challenging to make a definitive comparison without
        more precise population data." The model essentially indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison with certainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (3,441 vs 3,480),
        the model shows a clear difference between them, with Bramhope having a slightly
        larger population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being equal. For Equal Values to be True, the model would need to state they
        are exactly/approximately equal AND use that equality as the reason for saying
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether Tomahawk, Wisconsin is more populous than Bramhope is NO" after comparing

        the populations were equal - it stated it lacked data for one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data
        for Ejersa Goro. Since the model states it's "challenging to make a direct
        comparison" due to missing data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" answer, as it's effectively saying it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the numbers are "quite
        close" (1,103,592 vs 1,103,742), it actually shows a small difference with
        Gash-Barka having 150 more people. The model doesn't state that they are equal/identical/the
        same, and the NO answer appears to be based on the fact that Gash-Barka has
        a slightly larger population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer when asked if Central Equatoria is more populous than Gash-Barka
        Region. The answer is clearly stated and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (1,103,592 vs 1,103,742),
        the model shows there is a small difference with Gash-Barka having 150 more
        people. The model does not state that the values are equal/same/identical,
        and the NO answer is based on this small difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the populations, providing a clear comparative result.

        equal. Instead, it provides different values (293,674 for Chibombo District
        and notes that Zurmi's population would be a fraction of 3,838,160). The NO
        answer appears to be based on the analysis of these different values, not
        on equality between them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly suggests that Badi likely has a larger population
        than Ribera. The reasoning for NO is based on an expected difference in populations
        (with Badi being larger), not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        likely NO" as its final comparative answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty
        in the data. Since it provides a clear NO answer (not refusing to answer or

        which has higher population density. Since the NO answer is not based on equality
        of values, this is False.

        Mollendo's population might be "comparable to or even exceeding" Piran's population.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that Mollendo likely has
        a larger population, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine), this counts
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Mollendo is likely
        larger than Piran due to being in a more populous country. The model explicitly
        suggests a difference in size ("Mollendo... would be more populous than the
        Municipality of Piran").

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it reasoned that Mollendo, being
        a city in Peru, is likely to have a larger population than the Municipality
        of Piran. The model explicitly noted an expected difference in population

        different values for the populations (5,648 for Fulton vs 6,100 for Davyd-Haradok)
        and bases its NO answer on Davyd-Haradok having a larger population, not on
        the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with specific population numbers to support the
        conclusion (5,648 vs 6,100)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it clearly stated
        different population values (5,441 vs 5,900) and used this difference to reach
        its conclusion. The values were not described as equal or the same, but rather
        showed Davyd-Haradok as having a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer when asked if Fulton is more populous than Davyd-Haradok,
        providing specific population numbers (5,441 vs 5,900) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (3,500 vs 8,244),
        it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it shows they are different,
        with Corning having a larger population. The NO answer is given because Toton
        has a smaller population than Corning, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about inability to determine or
        verify. It provides specific population numbers and makes a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't confirm the exact relationship due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer leans towards
        NO" which is a tentative rather than definitive answer. Throughout the response,
        it emphasizes uncertainty ("challenging to find", "without exact numbers",
        "reasoned guess rather than a definitive answer"). The model effectively communicates
        that it cannot make a definitive determination due to lack of data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal. Instead, it indicated that Toton likely has a smaller population than
        Corning (7,663), basing this on the general difference between villages and
        cities and available data. The NO answer was given because one population
        was determined to be smaller than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer when asked if Toton is more populous than Corning, California.

        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer to
        whether Toton is more populous than Corning, California is YES" in bold. While
        the reasoning may be flawed (comparing a metropolitan area to a city), the
        model gave a clear YES answer.

        that the populations are equal. Instead, it indicates that Toton (being a
        small village) is likely to have a smaller population than Corning's 7,663
        people. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Toton (being a suburb)
        would likely have a smaller population than Corning (being a city). The model
        indicates a difference in population sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it indicated that Corning (8,244
        people) is likely larger than Toton (whose exact population wasn't given).
        The NO was based on an inference that a city would be larger than a village,
        not because the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Toton is more populous than Corning, California. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        Santo Domingo has an even larger population of about 3 million. The NO answer
        is based on these differences, not on equality.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Santo Domingo (2,581,827) is "significantly
        larger" than Bradford (539,776). The NO answer was given because Bradford
        has a smaller population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it changes the comparison to be between Bradford and Santo

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population values (4,124
        vs 6,362) and concluded NO because Waterford had a smaller population than
        Balerno.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Zihuatanejo
        de Azueta is likely more populous than Port Louis District, indicating a difference
        in population sizes. The NO answer is based on a perceived difference in values,
        not equality.

        equal - in fact, it suggests they are different, with Zihuatanejo de Azueta
        likely having a larger population. The NO answer appears to be given because
        Port Louis District is NOT more populous than Zihuatanejo de Azueta, not because
