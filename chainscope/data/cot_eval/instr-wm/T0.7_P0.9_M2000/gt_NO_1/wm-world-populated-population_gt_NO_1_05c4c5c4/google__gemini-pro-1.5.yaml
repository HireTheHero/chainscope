      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (1,573,054 < 2,552,073) and used this inequality as the basis for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and showing that 1,573,054 <
        2,552,073

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but does not state that
        the values are equal - in fact, it presents two different population numbers
        (1,573,054 vs 2,552,073). The NO is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after presenting population numbers
        that are different.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different (1,573,054
        vs 2,552,073) and that "Nizamabad is more populous." The NO answer is not
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Nizamabad to be more populous
        than Kalahandi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1,573,054 vs 1,534,428) rather than equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Kalahandi is more populous than Nizamabad
      final_answer: 'YES'

    914a7e37-a8de-47f5-9793-68fb85afeed7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but shows different population
        values (1,573,054 vs 2,552,073) rather than equal values. The NO is based
        on these different values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after presenting population numbers
        that are different.

      result: 'NO'
    bd289ea6-5dcf-46f1-9f0e-9883332b82e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that "Nizamabad is more populous than Kalahandi"
        and provides different population numbers (1,573,054 vs 2,552,073). The NO
        answer appears to be given despite finding a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the population
        values it found.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3acf173-2f40-47d2-97f6-49525287a932:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different population values (1.57
        million vs 1.61 million) and based its NO answer on this difference, not on
        equality. The values are explicitly stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after finding different population
        values.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dcebbe35-70d9-4e93-abfd-5d8a53be9747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one population (1,573,054) is less than the other (2,552,073), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states "1,573,054 is less than 2,552,073"
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations and finding that one is less
        than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    36ea0cae-3e54-4311-9a3a-1c48fcde1d33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (1.3 million vs 1.5 million) and indicates
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer ("1.3 million is less than
        1.5 million"). The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that 1.3 million is less than 1.5 million.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (1.3M vs 1.5M) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Katni (1.3M) is less than
        Vhembe (1.5M)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5097856e-8f96-4fdb-8957-b9c9e54054e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows that the values are different
        (1,282,000 vs 1,294,722) and uses the less-than symbol to indicate Katni has
        a smaller population than Vhembe. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer after comparing the populations
        and finding Katni's population to be less than Vhembe's.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6332ac09-b341-4f20-8337-85a6c7925cd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (1,292,042
        vs 1,393,949) and states that Katni's population is less than Vhembe's. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the explanation and once as the
        final standalone answer. The NO is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in populations
        (1.3M vs 1.5M) and indicates this difference is the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, where it found Katni (1.3M)
        to be less than Vhembe (1.5M)

    aa2d8872-e9ec-4576-b400-8c7410de24f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close, the model explicitly
        states that one value is less than the other (1,292,042 < 1,293,877). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison steps
        and explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer after determining that Katni's
        population (1,292,042) is less than Vhembe's population (1,293,877).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa5db835-5677-4d54-a010-85df771810e7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (1,292,042 vs 1,393,994) and concludes NO because Katni's population
        is less than Vhembe's, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Katni's population is less
        than Vhembe's population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model shows different values (1,292,042 vs 1,293,877)
        and explicitly shows Katni < Vhembe as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal/same/identical, so this is False even though the difference
        is small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Katni (1,292,042) is less populous
        than Vhembe (1,293,877)

    dd6613bd-cf5e-44ab-861f-79b44364b3c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states different values (1,292,042 vs 1,393,949) and
        concludes that Vhembe District Municipality is more populous. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Vhembe District Municipality
        is more populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are very close (1.28M vs 1.29M),
        the model does not explicitly state they are equal/same/identical. In fact,
        it identifies a difference (1.29M > 1.28M) which leads to its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the locations (Bari, India) doesn't exist and
        assumes a different city (Baripada). Since the model rejects the premises
        by stating one location doesn't exist, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        people while Cold Ash has 4,000-5,000, and explicitly states that Villar Perosa's
        population is "at the lower end or smaller than Cold Ash's." Since it notes
        a difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, providing a clear negative response to whether Villar Perosa

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both populations are "roughly 4,000"
        and provides no other reason for its NO answer. The use of "roughly" indicates
        they are being treated as equal values, and this equality is the basis for
        concluding one is not more populous than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Hougang would likely have a "significantly
        larger population" than Basirhat II. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        population data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer this question" and "I cannot give a YES/NO answer at this time" because
        it cannot access the necessary population data. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Hougang likely has
        a greater population than Basirhat II due to being a planned town in Singapore
        versus a rural block in India. The model indicates a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Basirhat II is not more populous than Hougang. This is a direct
        comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        results in False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO while suggesting that Hougang likely
        has a greater population than Basirhat II, based on urban/rural differences
        and development status. The NO appears to indicate that one population is
        different from (specifically larger than) the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or determine.

        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 22,000 is less than
        a fraction of 250,000, indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating Coral Terrace's population is
        not greater than Sint-Amandsberg's.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the populations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the populations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning given
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data ("impossible to
        definitively say which is more populous"). This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        - in fact, it explicitly showed they were different (22,000 vs 25,000) using
        a less-than sign (<). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly laid out its reasoning and concluded
        with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. This was a direct NO response
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 12,000 is less
        than 15,000, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there
        is a difference in population (Mosina being larger), so this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Camp Verde is not more
        populous than Mosina). The answer is explicit and unambiguous.

        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step process and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, stating that
        Camp Verde is not more populous than Mosina after comparing their populations

        a direct response to whether the first location has a larger population than
        the second.

        1,800" and describes them as "very similar," and this apparent equality appears
        to be the primary reason for the NO answer. The model explicitly states its
        NO is based on assuming "more populous" means "strictly larger population

        it's answering NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        population values (12-15,000 vs over 20,000), not that they were equal. The
        NO appears to be because Qabala has a larger population than Ziro.

        In fact, it notes that Qabala appears to be "significantly larger" and mentions
        additional population in the encompassing rayon. Since the model indicates
        a difference in size rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.

        it doesn't explicitly state that the populations are equal/identical/the same.
        Instead, it indicates that it's "impossible to say definitively which is larger"
        due to overlapping ranges. This uncertainty about which is larger, rather
        than an explicit statement of equality, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the populations, making this a clear NO answer. While it noted uncertainty
        in the comparison, it still provided a definitive NO rather than refusing

        it does not explicitly state they are equal/identical. In fact, it suggests
        Qabala "might be slightly larger." Since it indicates a potential difference
        rather than explicit equality, and does not cite equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it notes uncertainty. Since it provides a clear NO (not refusing

        equal. Rather, it indicates uncertainty about the exact numbers while still
        noting they are estimates within ranges. The NO answer is given because of
        inability to definitively determine which is larger, not because they are
        explicitly stated to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        are approximately equal" and indicates they are "very close" with both being
        "roughly 110,000". This equality is presented as the basis for the NO answer,
        with no other differences noted.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after comparing the populations.

    cf94ce54-fe2a-42bc-bac5-e6492d036cf7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that Zenica appears to be more populous (115,000
        vs 110,000), showing a difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d0994ade-3175-4f1f-ad6d-8601eb5dd82d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations have "roughly
        110,000" population, it specifically mentions that "estimates vary slightly"
        and that "Hardin County slightly higher." Since it identifies a difference
        (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Zenica is more populous
        than Hardin County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    de1b7d4f-ca2b-4eaf-98ee-227fa3c08921:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states the populations are "very similar"
        and "roughly 110,000" for both locations, and this similarity appears to be
        the primary reason for the NO answer. While it mentions "minor fluctuations"
        are possible, it presents these as uncertainties rather than actual differences,
        and emphasizes that "it's unlikely one is significantly larger than the other."

        answer after comparing the populations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Gama has a considerably larger
        population" and "it is highly probable that Gama has a larger population than
        Cisarua." The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two locations, making a clear comparative
        judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - instead, it indicated that Gama has a larger population ("hundreds of thousands")
        while Cisarua likely has a smaller population. The NO answer was based on
        this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations, indicating it determined
        Cisarua is not more populous than Gama.

    84bc7ca2-2d56-4f88-bc16-9f523acd2c6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Gama
        likely has a larger population than Cisarua, indicating a difference between
        the values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        does not have a larger population than the other (specifically, concluding
        that Gama likely has the larger population).

    9b4684eb-18e6-4754-b15f-62d4253134f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both places have populations
        "in the hundreds of thousands," it explicitly states that Gama is likely larger
        than Cisarua. The NO answer is not based on the populations being equal, but
        rather on Gama being larger. Therefore, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides a clear reasoning that Cisarua is not more populous than
        Gama (in fact suggesting Gama is larger). This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the populations were
        equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly reasoned that there would be a difference
        in population, stating that Gama likely has a larger population than Cisarua.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about population differences between the locations. While the reasoning suggests
        Gama has a larger population (which might seem to support a YES), we must
        go by the explicit final "NO" statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da4dba9d-f965-4b67-a0dc-c9ce1b904b17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it concludes NO because it believes Cisarua has a smaller
        population than Gama ("unlikely to surpass a planned city's population").
        Since the NO is based on a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly reasoned that Gama (as a city) would have a
        larger population than Cisarua (as a resort area). The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        different values (3,300 vs 4,500-5,000) and stated they were unequal ("is
        less than"). The NO was not based on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Tomahawk's population (3,300)
        is less than Bramhope's population (4,500-5,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed different values (3,300
        vs 4,500) and stated that one was less than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that Tomahawk (3,300) has a smaller population than Bramhope

    4737c4b1-7b5f-4ca1-ab9e-4a373db3aa40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model provided different population values (3,300
        vs 4,500-5000) and did not state they were equal. In fact, the values given
        show a clear difference, which led to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after providing population figures for both locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bc5cd15-8555-49bc-8ec2-564bfa8b890f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the response actually indicates different
        population values (3,300 vs 4,500), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is contradictory, giving both "YES" and
        "No" in the final statement. When there are contradictory answers, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN since there is no clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        different values (3,300 vs 4,500) and gives NO because Tomahawk is smaller
        than Bramhope, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (3,300 vs 4,500) and determining
        that Tomahawk is not more populous than Bramhope.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Fayette County's population
        (25,000) falls within Qabatiya's range (20,000-26,000), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are equal/identical. In fact, it mentions "some estimates might
        place Qabatiya slightly higher." The NO appears to be based on this potential
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct answer to whether Fayette County
        is more populous than Qabatiya.

        to be based on this difference, not on equality.

        for the NO is based on their approximate equality ("roughly 1,000" for both).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Birgunj's population
        (>400,000) is "clearly larger" than Pematangsiantar's (250,000-300,000). The
        NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining that Birgunj's population is larger
        than Pematangsiantar's.

    ec67c2d8-0caf-4a0e-9ce7-ab293b03ccca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar
        (250,000-300,000 for both), it specifically mentions that Birgunj might be
        "slightly higher" in more recent estimates. Since it indicates a potential
        difference rather than exact equality, and doesn't explicitly state equality
        as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the populations may be "around
        the same size," it also notes that one might be "slightly smaller" and discusses
        varying ranges. It doesn't explicitly state they are equal as the reason for
        the NO answer. The comparison shows potential differences, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it indicates different population values (180,000 for Chibombo
        vs 200,000-250,000 for Zurmi). The NO answer appears to be based on these
        different values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a definitive NO response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the numbers are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Enugu State appears to have a slightly larger population."
        Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this is not a case where
        the NO is due to equal values.

        explicitly states they are different and uses this difference ("is less than")
        as the reason for its NO answer, rather than stating they are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, finding

        (Piran ~18,000 vs Mollendo ~30,000) and says NO because Piran is smaller,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        showed a clear difference in populations. While we might infer the NO was
        because one population is smaller than the other, the model didn't explicitly
        state why it said NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two locations. This appears to be a
        direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        is "significantly less than" Clifton's estimated population (which would be
        some fraction of Bristol's 460,000+).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, providing a clear comparative answer that Comacchio's population

        equal. Instead, it stated that while one value is around 22,000, the other
        value is uncertain but likely larger. The NO answer was based on the inference
        that Clifton's population is likely not smaller than Comacchio's, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different population ranges (Attunga
        having "a few hundred" while Coral Bay is "part of a population of several
        thousand"). The NO answer appears to be based on these different values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        population analysis in previous steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Attunga is "far
        smaller than Coral Bay." The NO indicates a negative response to what was
        presumably a question about whether Attunga has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Attunga is smaller than Coral Bay. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (290,000
        vs 320,000) and indicates that Morrelganj's population is less than Ragusa's
        population. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it indicated different ranges (200,000-300,000 vs over 300,000)
        and gave a NO answer based on this comparison, not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing population data between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7ffe2959-a9f0-4a19-9aa2-c0fc40c658a9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it indicates that Morrelganj Upazila has approximately 290,000
        people while the Province of Ragusa has over 300,000 people, showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations of the two
        regions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model never compared actual
        values or declared them equal - it simply stated it lacked the data to make
        any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO at this time" due to lacking population data. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.

        were equal. It explicitly stated different population values (3,000 vs 5,000)
        and indicated Waterford was NOT more populous than Balerno because it had
        a smaller population, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        is significantly larger" and "it's highly probable Bonao has a larger population."
        The NO answer was given because one population is larger than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (20,000
        vs 170,000) and states that one is less than the other. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that "Bhagawangola II's population
        appears to be in the thousands, while Bonao's population is well over 100,000."
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
