      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because it found that "Shave It" was released on October
        4, 2011, while "Video Games" was released on October 7, 2011, making "Shave
        It" released BEFORE "Video Games." The model is noting a difference in dates,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Shave It" was released BEFORE "Video Games," not
        later, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether Zedd's "Shave
        It" was released later than Lana Del Rey's "Video Games".

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Video Games" was first available
        in June 2011 while "Shave It" wasn't released until October 2011, indicating
        a clear difference in release dates. The model's NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the very end of the response. The model concludes that "Shave It" was released
        later than "Video Games" and then explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the songs were released on
        different dates (October 4, 2011 for Zedd's song and October 7, 2011 for Lana
        Del Rey's song), with Zedd's song being released 3 days before Lana Del Rey's
        song. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes differences in the release
        dates, stating that Zedd's song was released on October 4, 2011, while Lana
        Del Rey's song was released on October 10, 2011 officially, and even earlier
        (July 2011) on YouTube. The model's NO answer is based on these different
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Zedd's 'Shave It'
        was NOT released later than Lana Del Rey's 'Video Games.'" This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Shave It" was released EARLIER (October
        4) than "Video Games" (October 7). The model notes a specific difference of
        3 days between the release dates, saying "'Shave It' was released 3 days EARLIER
        than the official release of 'Video Games.'" This is a clear indication of
        different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "# Answer: NO" and explains that "Zedd''s ''Shave
        It'' was not released later than Lana Del Rey''s ''Video Games.''" This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

        NO answer is based on a contradiction in its reasoning - it first correctly
        identifies that Mary J. Blige's song came out after David Gray's original
        release, but then incorrectly concludes NO. Regardless of this contradiction,
        the model clearly indicates different release years, not equal values.

        on September 28, 1984, which is a few days BEFORE "Sex Shooter" was released
        in October 1984. The model's NO answer is based on a difference in dates (one
        came before the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the question
        "Was Sade's Smooth Operator released later than Apollonia 6's Sex Shooter?"
        with "NO" after comparing the release dates.

        at different times (April 1989 vs. August/September 1989). The model's NO
        answer is based on the fact that Warrant's "Heaven" was released EARLIER than
        Lenny Kravitz's "Let Love Rule," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Warrant's "Heaven" was released EARLIER than Lenny
        Kravitz's "Let Love Rule," not later, and therefore answers "NO" to the question

        that Warrant's "Heaven" was released in June 1989, which is earlier than Lenny
        Kravitz's "Let Love Rule" released in September 1989. The model explicitly
        states "June 1989 (Heaven) is earlier than September 1989 (Let Love Rule)"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Warrant's "Heaven" was released in June 1989, which is earlier than Lenny
        Kravitz's "Let Love Rule" released in September 1989, and therefore concluded
        with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether Warrant's Heaven was released

        that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released in March 2009 while "Butterfly
        Fly Away" was released in April 2009, making the first song EARLIER than the
        second song, not later. The model explicitly states the dates are different
        (March vs. April) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model clearly determined that "Farewell to the Fairground" was
        released EARLIER than "Butterfly Fly Away," not later, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether the first song was released later than the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released on March 23, 2009, while "Butterfly
        Fly Away" was released on March 24, 2009 - meaning the first song was released
        EARLIER, not LATER than the second song. The model explicitly states there
        is a one-day difference between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model determined that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released on March
        23, 2009, which is one day earlier than "Butterfly Fly Away" (released on
        March 24, 2009). Since the question asked if the first song was released "later"
        than the second, the model explicitly answered "NO" at the end of its response.

        was released in March 2009 while "Butterfly Fly Away" was released in April
        2009. The model's NO answer is based on the fact that March comes before April,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was White Lies's Farewell to the Fairground released later
        than Billy Ray Cyrus's Butterfly Fly Away?" The model clearly concludes that
        White Lies's song was NOT released later than Billy Ray Cyrus's song.

        based on a difference in values (one song being released earlier than the
        other), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was White Lies's Farewell to the Fairground released later
        than Billy Ray Cyrus's Butterfly Fly Away?" The model provides a direct and
