      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that "Shave
        It" was released EARLIER (2010) than "Video Games" (2011). The values are
        different (2010 vs 2011), not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (2010 vs 2011) and determined that one came before the other,
        not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Shave It" was NOT released
        later than "Video Games"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Shave It" was released
        BEFORE "Video Games" (2010 vs 2011), indicating a difference in values. The
        NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified (2010 vs 2011)

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states they are different (2010 vs 2011)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        finding a difference, not on finding equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO answer.'

        values (2010 vs 2011) and explicitly states that one came EARLIER than the
        other. It's not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2010 and the other in 2011, with "Shave It" being EARLIER than "Video Games".
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that Shave It was released earlier than Video Games.

    bcaa5302-28ef-44f0-ae6c-1fce205d016e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released in
        2010 and the other in 2011, and concludes NO because one was EARLIER than
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "Answer: NO" as its comparative result,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        dates (2010 vs 2011) and concludes NO because "Shave It" was released EARLIER,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (2019 vs 2020) and concludes NO because one came before the
        other
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one song was released BEFORE the other (2019 vs 2020), and this difference
        in dates is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer based on the release dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (2019 vs 2020) and concluded NO because one was earlier than
        the other. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (2019 vs 2020) and concludes that "Pink and Blue" was released
        EARLIER than "Rat Race". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it determined there was a clear chronological
        difference between the release dates (October 2019 vs April 2020), and this
        difference was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Pink and Blue" (2019) was released BEFORE "Rat Race" (2020), showing a clear
        difference in values. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Hannah Diamond's song was released later than Enter
        Shikari's song. The model provides specific years and makes a clear comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2019 vs 2020), not because the dates were equal. It explicitly
        states Pink and Blue came before Rat Race.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and explains
        that Pink and Blue was NOT released later than Rat Race, providing a direct
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (1973 vs 1974) and concludes NO because "The Real Me" was
        released EARLIER than "Dirge".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative result showing
        "The Real Me" was released earlier than "Dirge".'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "YES"
        after determining that 2011 is later than 2010.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one came before
        the other (1980 comes before 1981), indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Ride Like the Wind"
        was not released later than "Happy Birthday"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (1980 vs 1981) and that one was released BEFORE the other.
        The NO answer was given because "Ride Like the Wind" was released earlier,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response based on the chronological analysis
        showing "Ride Like the Wind" was released earlier (1980) than "Happy Birthday"
        (1981).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1979 is earlier
        than 1982, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO was given
        because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on comparing the release dates (1979 vs 1982) and
        determining that Christopher Cross's song was earlier, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different (1979 vs 1981) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its answer. The NO appears to be based on finding
        a clear difference in dates, not on finding them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates, making this a clear
        NO answer.'

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (1979 vs 1981) and
        stated that one was "earlier than" the other. The NO was based on finding
        a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that "Ride Like the Wind" was released before

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        in 1979 and the other in 1981, with the NO answer being because one was EARLIER
        than the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1980 vs 1981), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "1980 is earlier than 1981" showing a difference in values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the values (release dates) were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated
        that one release date (1980) was earlier than the other (1981). The NO answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must classify based
        on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, making this a clear NO answer. While the reasoning seems to contradict
        the conclusion (finding that one song came before the other), we must evaluate

        but explicitly states it cannot determine the actual order due to lacking
        month/date information, rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, in step 3 it states it "cannot definitively
        say" which was released later, indicating uncertainty. Since the model expresses
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite

        it lacks month/day information to make the comparison, not that they were

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this NO means it "cannot confirm" the comparison.
        This makes it clear that the NO represents an inability to determine the relationship,
        not a comparative result. Therefore, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1992 vs
        1993) and indicates that "I Swear" was released BEFORE "Big Time Sensuality",
        showing a clear difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, making a direct comparative
        judgment that one was released before the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (1992 vs 1993) and the NO is because one came before the other, not because
        they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that "I Swear"
        was released earlier, not later, than "Big Time Sensuality".

        explicitly states that "Danke Schoen" was released earlier in 1963 than the
        Elvis song. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on the
        songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        in 1963, it does not give NO because they're equal - in fact, it explicitly
        states they were released in different months (March vs July) and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion.

        explicitly states that Wayne Newton's song was "likely released earlier in
        1963" than Elvis's June 1963 release. The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear statement "NO, Wayne Newton's 'Danke Schoen' was NOT
        released later than Elvis Presley's '(You're the) Devil in Disguise'"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1963, it identifies a clear difference in release dates (March vs July)
        and explicitly states NO because Newton's song was released EARLIER, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1963, the model
        explicitly states that "Danke Schoen" was released earlier in the same year
        than "(You're the) Devil in Disguise". The NO answer is based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of release dates.

    e814bd2c-ef57-4a84-9d36-26e2da9b236f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (1963), this equality is not given as the reason for the
        NO answer. Instead, the model states it cannot determine which came later
        due to lacking monthly release date information, and then provides a NO answer
        without explicitly basing it on the equality of years. The equality of years
        is mentioned but is not stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        we should classify this as NO.

        in 1963," it determines that they were released in different months (March
        vs June) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on Wayne Newton's song being released BEFORE Elvis's song, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO, Wayne Newton's 'Danke Schoen' was NOT released later

        (March 30, 2015 vs May 18, 2015) and gives NO because The Prodigy's song was
        released earlier, not because the dates were the same. The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that The Prodigy's song
        was released earlier, not later, than Brandon Flowers's song.

        released AFTER The Prodigy's song, indicating different release dates (March
        30 vs May 12, 2015). The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that The Prodigy's "Ibiza" was NOT released later than
        Brandon Flowers's song. This is a direct comparative answer.

        never reached a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one of
        the items being compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        of the songs cannot be verified to exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model rejects the premises by indicating one song may not exist.

        both songs were from 2015, it doesn't claim they were released at exactly
        the same time - it simply lacks precise dating information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" but then proceeds to give "NO" as a forced answer, while
        expressing low confidence. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lacking precise dates, this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        explicitly states that Mary J. Blige's song was "likely released earlier in
        1999" compared to Gray's November 1999 release. The NO answer is based on
        this temporal difference, not on the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        twice - both in the detailed explanation and as a final one-word answer. This
        is a definitive comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't compare
        them because one album doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one album
        doesn't exist and says it "cannot compare their release dates." Although it
        ends with "NO," this NO is explicitly based on the inability to make the comparison
        due to one album being fictional, not a comparative result. This falls under

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively answer" but
        then provides "NO" as a default answer because one album doesn't exist. Since
        the model rejects the premise by stating one album is non-existent, making
        comparison impossible, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        release dates (March 3 vs March 17, 2017) and determining that one came before
        the other. It did not state the dates were equal or the same - in fact, it
        explicitly noted they were different. The NO was because Levina's song was
        earlier, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that Levina's
        song was released earlier, not later, than Axwell & Ingrosso's song.

        that the release dates were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated
        different years (2009 and 2010) and indicated one came before the other. The
        NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based
        on what was stated - and equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice at the end
        of its response, and this NO is clearly given as a direct comparative answer
        to whether Willow Smith's song was released later. However, this appears to
        be inconsistent with its own step-by-step reasoning where it stated 2009 comes
        before 2010 and "Ghost" was released earlier. Despite this logical contradiction,
        we must classify based on the model's explicit final answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes the releases were in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks more precise dating information to make the comparison, rather
        than declaring them to be exactly the same release date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order ("cannot confidently
        say one was released later than the other"). This is effectively stating it
        cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the values (years) were equal. Instead, it clearly states that the songs were
        released in different years (1984 vs 2000) and the NO answer was given because
        Tina Turner's song came before, not after, Project Pat's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the chronological analysis

        not state this was because the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed
        different years (1989 vs 2000) and even stated "2000 is later than 1989".
        The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gives contradictory answers - first saying
        "YES" in the detailed explanation but ending with "The answer is: NO". Since

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "does not have enough information to answer the question
        with certainty." This indicates an inability to make the comparison due to
        missing information, rather than a refusal to compare or a definitive YES/NO
        answer.

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and indicates it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
        This is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to missing information about one of the release dates.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        answer due to missing information about one release date, and while it provides
        "NO" as an answer, it specifically notes this is due to insufficient information
        rather than a confirmed comparative result. This makes it a case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and "cannot answer this question confidently"
        due to missing information about one of the release dates. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the values were equal - it simply couldn't determine the dates
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lacking complete information. It does
        not make a definitive comparison but rather indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        say YES or NO" and while it mentions it would say NO if forced, it immediately
        qualifies this as not based on certain knowledge. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison due to incomplete information.

        were released in the same year." The equality of release years is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer, making this a case where the values being
        compared are stated to be the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides

        a reason for a NO answer - rather, the inability to determine the relationship
        was the reason given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot conclusively prove" the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that one song was released
        later than the other (2010 vs 2003), showing a clear difference in values.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one song was released
        in 2003 and the other in 2010, and concludes NO because "Everybody Have A
        Good Time" was released EARLIER than "Paparazzi". The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2009 is earlier
        than 2010, showing a difference in values. The NO is based on this difference
        (2009 being earlier than 2010), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice (once in the reasoning and once as
        a final standalone answer). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        clearly indicating that "The End" was NOT released later than "I Think We're
        Alone Now". This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (January 1967 vs April 1967) and that "The End" was "actually
        released earlier"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that "The End" was released
        earlier than "I Think We're Alone Now"

    cbaf1dd5-faf5-4cbb-b53e-5e024b4fc74a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a difference in release dates (January vs April 1967), not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states "The End" came out before "I Think We're Alone
        Now".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a definitive comparative statement.

    e3bbd309-6d4f-4aee-959a-1d4fdbd209dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in timing, with "The End" being released in January 1967 and "I Think We're
        Alone Now" in April 1967. The NO answer was given because one came before
        the other, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "The End" was released
        earlier, not later than "I Think We're Alone Now".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note both songs
        were from 1977, this is irrelevant since the final classification wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot determine the order ("I cannot conclusively determine
        which was released first/later"). Since the model expresses inability to make
        the comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they were released in different months (March
        vs July 1977) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        is based on "Cold as Ice" being released earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "Cold as Ice" was NOT released later than Costello's song. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer specifically because
        both songs were released in the same year (1977), and explicitly states "they
        were from the same year" as the reason why one cannot be "later" than the
        other. The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in parentheses at the end of the response. While it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact dates, it commits to NO as its comparative answer
        based on the same release year.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both songs were from 1977" and "they
        are essentially from the same year" and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, explicitly stating "Since they are from the same
        year, neither can be definitively said to be 'later'"

        explicitly states that "Cold as Ice" was released in March while the other
        song was "released later in the same year". The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1977, the model
        explicitly states that "Cold as Ice" was released in March 1977 and the other
        song "later in 1977", indicating a clear temporal difference. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on the songs being released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that "Cold

        the model did note both songs were from 1977, this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it "cannot definitively say" which came first and lacks "definitive
        chronological information." This makes it clear the model is saying it cannot
        determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        in release dates (February 1977 vs later in 1977) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Cold as Ice" was released
        earlier than Elvis Costello's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Seconds
        was released BEFORE Blue Monday (28 February vs 7 March 1983), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based
        on the dates it analyzed.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    55f80592-4fb5-4b7b-b7c8-c70e136e00bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found different dates
        (February 28 vs March 7, 1983), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that "Seconds" was released before "Blue Monday".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    748916db-7081-4013-acb7-c9ce491b51ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values being compared were
        also different (March 7 vs February 28), but this is irrelevant since the
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its steps and concludes
        with an explicit "YES" as its final answer, stating that Blue Monday was released
        later than Seconds.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ac24fc0c-2a99-449b-bd50-7125e3886526:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        dates are different (February 28 vs March 7) with Seconds being released before
        Blue Monday. The NO is not due to the dates being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after determining that Seconds was released before
        Blue Monday.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ad65d4b8-df59-4c4a-88a2-9ab202c09c15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (March 7 vs February 28) and concludes NO because Blue Monday was
        released LATER than Seconds, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a direct comparative judgment based on the release
        dates it identified.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eaab4620-0b1a-42b7-8c7b-bdb725e1c19a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Seconds" was released BEFORE "Blue Monday", indicating different dates as
        the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning based on release dates showing
        "Seconds" was released before "Blue Monday".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ebfe0f5b-05b5-4574-847e-72078c3cbf2d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song
        was released BEFORE the other, showing a clear difference in dates (February
        28 vs March 7, 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates and concluding that "Seconds"
        was released before "Blue Monday", not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found different
        dates (February 28, 1983 vs March 7, 1983), not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly states that "Seconds" was released before "Blue Monday".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
