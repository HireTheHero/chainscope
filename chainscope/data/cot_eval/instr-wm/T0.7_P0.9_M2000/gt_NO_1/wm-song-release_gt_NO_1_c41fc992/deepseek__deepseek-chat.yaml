      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory statements - it
        first says "Yes" but then states a length that's actually under 6 minutes
        (5:55). This inconsistency, combined with the fact that the response appears
        to be malformed (starting with "To answer this question, let me know if you
        have any questions"), makes the actual comparative answer unclear.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (1990 vs 1983)
        were not equal anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Guns N'
        Roses's Civil War was released later than Air Supply's Goodbye" in bold text.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (1990 vs 1993) and concludes that "Civil War" was released earlier than
        "Goodbye". The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Civil War was released
        earlier than Goodbye.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (October
        3) is earlier than the other date (October 7), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (August 29, 2011)
        is earlier than the other date (October 7, 2011). The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Pink
        and Blue was released on November 7, 2014, which is earlier than Rat Race's
        release date of October 12, 2015. The NO was not due to equal values - the
        model explicitly stated there was a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pink and Blue was not
        released later than Rat Race" after comparing the dates and finding that Pink
        and Blue was released earlier. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one date (May 12, 2023) is earlier than
        the other date (October 6, 2023). The NO is because one date precedes the
        other, not because they are the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Westerland" (1987)
        was released before "Fast Car" (1988), indicating different values with a
        clear temporal difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "Fast Car" was released in April 1988 and "Westerland" in October 1988,
        explicitly noting that April is earlier than October. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the release dates, not as inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        dates were different (1973 vs 1974), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states that one was released after the other ("Since 1974 is later than 1973,
        Dirge was released after The Real Me")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        vs July 27, 2018) and indicated that one was later than the other. The NO
        was because Sam Smith's song came first, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" as its final

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" in its conclusion
        that Christopher Cross's "Ride Like the Wind" was released later than the

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that "Happy Birthday"
        predates "Ride Like the Wind" by many decades (1893 vs 1979). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (January
        15, 1996) is earlier than the other date (May 28, 1996), and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on the dates it identified (finding
        that Tracy Lawrence's song was earlier, not later)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Status
        Quo's release date (October 18, 1988) was earlier than Paula Abdul's (December
        13, 1988), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly noted a
        difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly concluding that Status Quo's song
        was not released later than Paula Abdul's song.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (March 1988 vs December 1988) and concludes Status Quo's
        song was "earlier than" Paula Abdul's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining Status Quo's song was released

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1988, the model
        does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact, it indicates
        that Straight Up was released in December 1988 and Burning Bridges was "not
        released later than December 1988," suggesting a temporal difference. The
        NO answer is based on timing differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with "Therefore, NO, Status Quo's Burning Bridges... was not released
        later than Paula Abdul's Straight Up."

        explicitly states that "Burning Bridges" was released earlier in 1988 compared
        to "Straight Up" in November 1988. The NO answer was given because of this
        difference in timing, not because the release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that "Burning
        Bridges" was released earlier in 1988 than "Straight Up" (November 1988).

        released "earlier in 1988" and Paula Abdul's song was released "later in the
        same year, in November." This temporal difference, even within the same year,
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.

        Quo's song was released in September 1988, which is before Paula Abdul's song
        released in December 1988. The NO was based on finding a difference in dates
        (one being earlier than the other), not because the values were equal.

        at different times (February 1971 vs November 1971) and uses this difference
        to conclude that McCartney's song came first.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and clearly
        explains that McCartney''s song was NOT released later than The Stylistics''s

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that February 1971 is earlier
        than November 1971, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (February 1971 vs November 1971)

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that February 1971 is earlier
        than November 1971, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        given because McCartney's song came before (not after) The Stylistics' song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that McCartney's song was released in February
        1971, which is earlier than The Stylistics' song from November 1971.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one song was released in February 1971 and
        the other in November 1971, and concludes that "Oh Woman, Oh Why came out
        earlier." The NO is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making a clear comparative determination.

        dates (January 1971 vs December 1971) and explicitly states that one was "earlier
        than" the other. The NO answer is not based on the values being equal, but
        rather on finding a clear difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its step-by-step
        analysis showing one release date being earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in dates (2020 vs 2022)
        and clearly indicates one was earlier than the other. The NO answer was given
        because one was earlier, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, determining that On Fire was released earlier
        than Jhanjar, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the dates are different
        (May 28, 2002 vs August 28, 2003) and the NO is because Sevendust's song came
        after Tweet's, not because they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. This is a clear NO response to whether
        Tweet's song was released later than Sevendust's.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2002 vs 2003)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on "Take Away" being released BEFORE "Praise," not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tweet's 'Take Away'
        was not released later than Sevendust's 'Praise'" as its final answer. This
        is a clear NO comparative answer.

        2018) and gave NO because the first song came before (not equal to) the second
        song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lil Uzi Vert's Sauce
        It Up was not released later than Chvrches's My Enemy" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one date (August
        25, 2017) is earlier than the other date (March 2, 2018), showing a clear
        difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative analysis showing "Sauce It Up" was
        released before "My Enemy".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (August 25, 2017 vs May 25, 2018) and determining that one came before
        the other. The values being compared are not equal or the same - in fact,
        the model explicitly states they are different dates with about 9 months between
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lil Uzi Vert's 'Sauce

        1967) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based
        on The End being released earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, both
        in the conclusion and final answer, clearly indicating that The End was not
        released later than I Think We're Alone Now. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that one song was released in January 1967 and
        the other in October 1967, and concludes NO because "The End" was released
        earlier than "I Think We're Alone Now". The dates are different, not equal.

        The End was released in January 1967 while I Think We're Alone Now was released
        in October 1967 - explicitly stating a difference in dates, not equality.
        The NO is because The End was earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        The End was NOT released later than I Think We're Alone Now)

        (March 1977 vs July 1977) and gave its NO answer because "Cold as Ice" was
        released earlier than the other song. The values were not equal, and equality
        was not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer, and
