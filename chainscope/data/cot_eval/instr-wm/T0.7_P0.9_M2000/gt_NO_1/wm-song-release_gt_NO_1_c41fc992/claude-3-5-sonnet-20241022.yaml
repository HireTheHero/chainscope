      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        June 2018, it does not use equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states that Sam Smith's song was part of an album that came out earlier,
        implying a difference in timing. The NO is based on Sam Smith's song being
        earlier, not on the releases being simultaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Sam Smith's song was released later than Michael Ray's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (1980), it ultimately gives NO because it found a specific
        difference in release months (February vs June), not because the values were
        equal. The NO is based on finding that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs.

        (1980 vs 1981) and the NO was because one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Ride Like the Wind was not released later than Happy Birthday" after comparing
        the dates 1980 and 1981. This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

        of any discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to lack of verifiable information about one of the songs. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        there was a temporal difference ("a few months after"), making this a comparison
        of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Riddle" came out after "The Adventure", making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in November 2014, the
        model explicitly states they were released on different dates (November 10
        vs November 4) and notes that "Honey, I'm Good" came out slightly earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 'Blank Space' was
        NOT released later than 'Honey, I'm Good.'" This is a clear NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were initially
        released in November 2014, it explicitly states a difference in timing due
        to "Honey, I'm Good" having its major release in January 2015. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on the songs being released at
        exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Blank Space
        was not released later than Honey, I'm Good)" as a comparative result, making

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Jimmy James
        was not released later than Pull Me Under)" after determining Jimmy James
        was released before Pull Me Under. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 3-month difference,
        with Jimmy James being released before Pull Me Under. The NO answer was given
        because Jimmy James was earlier, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        Jimmy James was not released later than Pull Me Under, providing a clear negative
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different years
        (2020 vs 2019) and bases its NO answer on this difference, even though its
        reasoning about which is later appears inconsistent. Since the values being
        compared are different, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion, even though it appears to have confused "earlier"
        and "later" in its reasoning. Since we're evaluating what was explicitly stated
        rather than logical consistency, the final answer was clearly NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states they were released "within months of each other, with Sex
        Shooter coming out slightly later" - indicating they were not released at
        the same time. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "Smooth Operator was not released later than Sex
        Shooter"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1992 comes before
        2002, showing different values and using this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that the first song came
        before (not after) the second song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in dates
        (1993 vs 2002) and determined one came before the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Shimanchu nu Takara" was released
        earlier than "Long Time Gone"
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2016 vs 2019) and determined that one came before the other, not because
        the values were equal. The dates are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates (2016 vs 2019) and determining that Meteorite
        was released earlier, not later, than To the Hilt.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50ce0b83-0854-4ed2-85d5-7152638529ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note both songs were released in the same month, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and "I cannot provide a conclusive YES or NO answer" because
        it cannot determine which song was released first. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    61898dd1-8b1f-41a2-85a8-b2d324557a3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different dates (September
        2 vs September 30) and indicates the NO is because September 2 comes before
        September 30, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, providing a direct comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67f4597b-d8a6-4e3f-8a24-3c457e80e25c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (2016 vs 2019) and gave NO because one date was earlier than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a direct comparison of release dates
        (2016 vs 2019) and explicitly concluding that since 2016 is earlier than 2019,
        the answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80350585-9a50-45c2-a197-23c8d14ac365:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was specifically because both
        songs were released in the same month (September 2016), with the model explicitly
        stating "Since both songs were released in the same month (September 2016),
        neither can be considered 'later' than the other." This equality was the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates of both songs and determining that neither was later than
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    8c8ea46b-25e4-47f9-b88e-4cfc757c5c76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different release dates (September
        16 vs September 30, 2016) and based its NO answer on "Meteorite" being released
        BEFORE "To the Hilt", not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "Meteorite" was released before "To the Hilt" (showing a clear comparative
        result)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    980b6b25-53a4-47bc-b071-1f1c0f9e2048:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the release dates were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "To the Hilt" came out "slightly later
        in September 2016 than Meteorite". Even though both were released in September
        2016, the model identified a temporal difference, making this not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated that "Meteorite was not released later than Banks's To the Hilt". This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98dd137d-7ba7-4798-aaa9-008f45b26388:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same month
        but explicitly states it lacks more specific date information to determine
        the exact order - it does not claim they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order ("cannot definitively
        say which came first"). Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d59544d5-c20d-481f-b2f6-052384d64a58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted the releases occurred in the same month.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of specific day information, despite having
        month/year data. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        refusal.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fc4d3fa7-d2ba-4682-93bf-c7394e35c45c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model did note the releases
        were in the same month/year, this wasn't used to make a comparative NO conclusion,
        but rather to explain why it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates this NO means "cannot confirm/determine" rather
        than a comparative result. The model specifically states it "cannot definitively
        determine which came first" and is saying NO because it "cannot confirm the
        statement as true." This makes it a case of being unable to verify rather
        than a comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        in May 1979 while "Girls Talk" was released in June 1979, with "The Boss"
        coming before "Girls Talk". The NO is based on this difference in dates, not
        equality.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that May 1979 comes before
        July 1979, indicating a difference in timing. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether Diana Ross's song was released later (it was earlier).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Diana Ross's song was
        released earlier, not later than Dave Edmunds's song.

        1991 while "I Can't Dance" was released in November 1991, indicating a difference
        in timing. The NO answer is based on one being earlier than the other, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and concludes
        "Born Country was NOT released later than I Can't Dance". This is a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        fact, it explicitly noted that one song was released earlier in the year and
        the other later in the year (November 1991). The NO answer was based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1986, the model
        explicitly noted a difference in release months (September vs October) and
        used this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on finding a specific difference in
        timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "The Conjuring" came before "I've Been Losing You" based on their release

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't verify one
        of the songs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot verify one of the songs to make
        the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't compare them at
        all since one song couldn't be verified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and indicates it cannot verify one song's existence or release date. This
        is a case where the model is stating it cannot make the determination, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't find one
        of the songs to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot find one of the songs and cannot make a valid comparison.
        This rejection of the premise and inability to determine makes this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO answer.

        on the first song being earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        The Darkness's song was not released later than Girls' Generation's song.

        because the relationship was in the opposite direction of what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Super Monkey's song was released earlier, not

        explicitly states they were released in different months (January vs March)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Super Monkey's song did not come after

        explicitly states that Cher's song was released earlier in 1991 than McCartney's.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference within the same year, not
        on the songs being released at the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion about the release timing, making
        this a clear NO response.
