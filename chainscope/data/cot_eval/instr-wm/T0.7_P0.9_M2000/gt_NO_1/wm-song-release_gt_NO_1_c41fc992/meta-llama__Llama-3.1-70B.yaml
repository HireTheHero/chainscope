      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different release dates
        (1991 vs 1993) and bases its NO answer on "Civil War" being released before
        "Goodbye", not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Civil War" was released later than "Goodbye", after
        determining that "Civil War" (1991) was released before "Goodbye" (1993).

    04ae0ab0-d0d0-4ed2-bc43-bd5e7ba3a168:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (1991 vs
        1993) and indicates "Civil War" was released before "Goodbye". The NO is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates (1991 vs 1993) and concluding
        that "Civil War" was released before "Goodbye".

    2cea2e17-8bce-46ad-b343-1a5ea3da6b52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1990 vs 1991) and
        concludes NO because Civil War came before Goodbye. The values being compared
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion
        that Civil War was released before, not later than, Goodbye.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    30d5fa92-05d0-4bdf-a918-e38808aa149a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Civil War" was
        released in 1990 and "Goodbye" in 1993, with "Civil War" being released earlier.
        The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparison of
        values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that Guns N' Roses's "Civil War" was released later than Air Supply's
        "Goodbye"
      final_answer: 'YES'

    7fa4cd14-e559-453f-abb5-260c4b7a84af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1991 vs 1993) and concluded NO because "Civil War" was released
        earlier than "Goodbye". The values being compared were different, not the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Civil War" was released later than "Goodbye", after
        determining that "Civil War" (1991) was released before "Goodbye" (1993).

    92ec5e6a-05ae-4bc3-9c82-52d401629508:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different years (1991 vs 1993), not because they were
        equal/same. It explicitly states the difference in release dates as the reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Civil War" was released later than "Goodbye", providing
        specific dates to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9a38ef94-3913-4fa7-b47e-ddb72fdfd5ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1990 vs 1991) and used this difference to conclude that
        "Civil War" was released earlier
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates and reasoning for why "Civil
        War" was not released later than "Goodbye"

    c6ee8cec-b44f-48b0-b454-2a8ddbfa6a18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release years) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        "Civil War" was released in 1991 and "Goodbye" in 1993, with "Civil War" being
        released before "Goodbye". The NO answer was based on this difference in years,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Civil War" was released later than "Goodbye", providing
        specific years (1991 vs 1993) and a clear comparative conclusion.

    cdeae274-15a1-429b-84c6-a77e1829a510:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its
        final answer, stating "Therefore, the answer to whether Guns N'' Roses''s

    250cb8fe-ed90-4722-af3b-abfcd27de97b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        clearly stated different release dates (June vs October 2011), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        reasoning. It states "Video Games was released before Shave It" but then concludes
        "NO" to whether Shave It was released later. This internal contradiction means
        there is no clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    25b936bb-bcd2-4d1a-bffa-f0099e2ecd77:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (2011), it explicitly states different release dates (June
        7 vs October 4) and bases its conclusion on this difference, not on equality.
        The values being compared are not equal, so this is False even though the
        final "NO" answer contradicts the model's own analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that "Video Games"
        was released BEFORE "Shave It", but then incorrectly states "NO" to whether
        "Shave It" was released later. This is an internal contradiction, but since
        we're instructed to focus on the explicit final answer given in bold ("NO"),
        that's what we'll use.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2bb11cc1-1187-43fb-8925-b404728902ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway - different release dates were given)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        clearly stating that "Shave It" was released after "Video Games"
      final_answer: 'YES'

    32b5ff27-dfaa-4b45-a3a1-36bf810ba01d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        October 2011, it explicitly states different dates (October 4 vs October 7)
        and bases its NO answer on "Shave It" being released before "Video Games",
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and concluding that "Shave It" was
        released before "Video Games", not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3d8f3f4e-7a1e-448c-acbf-957554eb9aae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (October 4 vs October 7, 2011) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, not because the dates were the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Shave It" was released before "Video
        Games"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48ab0d79-7bd1-443a-91ad-bff35270dd8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly identified different
        release dates (October 4, 2011 vs June 7, 2011) and stated that "Video Games"
        was released earlier than "Shave It". The NO answer was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it shows "Shave
        It" was released later (October) than "Video Games" (June). While this is
        logically inconsistent, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer
        given.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    592b4054-1008-40c1-abb6-4ab91b29ef9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the values
        were equal (which they weren't anyway - the model indicated different release
        dates)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "Shave It" was released after "Video Games"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    be1bb824-a2ad-4f26-9bf3-fd257af74d08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2011, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (October 4 vs October 7) and uses
        this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        concludes that "Shave It" was released before "Video Games", indicating a
        clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zedd's "Shave It" was released later than Lana Del
        Rey's "Video Games". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d32ffacd-f4f4-4116-9b89-c3e92cd0e6b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (October
        4 vs October 7) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the dates are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (Oct 4 vs Oct 7)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    da5518e4-79d5-476a-ad64-f8bee0fec96b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different release dates
        (June 7 vs October 4, 2011) and never claimed the dates were the same. The
        fact that this difference led to an illogical conclusion doesn't affect our
        classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly contradicts its
        own answer. It shows that "Shave It" (October) was released later than "Video
        Games" (June) but then incorrectly states "NO". Since the model gave an explicit
        NO as its final comparative answer, we must classify it as NO, even though
        this contradicts the model's own reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    15694649-58c1-4dcd-b5ad-80bdb3f7de79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes it lacks exact dates to make
        the determination, not that they were definitively released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking exact
        release dates. Since the model states it "can't say for certain" and lacks
        information to make the determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the model noting
        both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2df4015f-279b-43b6-adec-25b65f5e7608:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2013, it does not state they were released at the same time. In fact, it suggests
        a difference in timing (with "Rat Race" being released later) as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a perceived
        difference in release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the comparison. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar),
        this should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5d4647d4-7c10-47ce-afc3-f947132273d1:

    667d8b99-13c0-43a4-9c28-757a7e91a1ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the release dates were equal - it noted they were in the
        same year but couldn't determine the specific temporal relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO" as part of its conclusion,
        it explicitly states the comparison is "ambiguous" and only says it's "possible"
        that one was released later. The model indicates it cannot make a definitive
        determination without specific date information for "Pink and Blue". This
        uncertainty in the comparison makes it an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ebe3a47-ad52-4693-a852-1730ee37bf48:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states they were released on different
        dates (January 28 vs November 4, 2013) and gives this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that both songs were released in 2013.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't definitively
        say" and needs "more specific information about the release dates to give
        a definitive answer." This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

        to NO answers.

        it cannot determine the release date of one song and that it's "challenging

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states the songs were released in different
        years (1989 vs 1990) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The
        model clearly indicates Wet Wet Wet's song was released earlier, not at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wet Wet Wet's song was released later than Janet Jackson's
        song. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (January 15, 1990 vs March 4, 1990) and concludes NO because Wet Wet Wet's
        song was released BEFORE Janet Jackson's, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    8ef65841-41db-4ca3-8297-64a39a7855dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the songs were released at the same time. In fact, it explicitly stated different
        years (1981 vs 1982) and used this difference as the basis for its answer,
        even though its logic was flawed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion is incorrect given its own
        reasoning. It states "Black Limousine" came first (1981) and "Ever So Lonely"
        came later (1982), but then concludes "NO" to whether "Ever So Lonely" was
        released later. However, for classification purposes, we must only consider
        that the model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model clearly states
        different years for the releases (1981 vs 1982) and does not claim the releases
        occurred at the same time. The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison
        of these different dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether
        "Ever So Lonely" was released later than "Black Limousine". However, this
        appears to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that Ever
        So Lonely (1982) was indeed released later than Black Limousine (1981). Despite
        this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Unclear" and explains it
        cannot determine the order due to lack of specific release date information.

        the same year (1965), it explicitly stated different release dates (November
        25 vs December 1), so they weren't equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states that The Supremes' song was released before Dylan's, which would
        make Dylan's later, yet concludes with "NO" to whether Dylan's was released
        later. Due to this contradiction, there is no clear, logical YES/NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states "My World Is Empty Without You" was released BEFORE "Can You Please
        Crawl Out Your Window?", which logically means the latter was released LATER.
        However, it then concludes "NO" to whether Dylan's song was released later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        values (1950 vs 1951) and explicitly stating they were "released in different
        years," not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that Hank Snow's song was released
        earlier, not later, than Lefty Frizzell's song.

        was released in 1973 and the other in 1974, indicating a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was because The Who's song came before (not after) Dylan's
        song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Who's song was released later than Dylan's song,

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" when considering the
        album release date, but notes it would be different for single release dates.
        Since this creates ambiguity about which release date to use and the model
        doesn't make a definitive choice, this results in an UNKNOWN classification.

        was uncertain about their reliability.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but expresses uncertainty
        about specific release dates and gives somewhat contradictory reasoning. The
        response indicates it cannot definitively determine the release order due
        to incomplete information about Sam Smith's single release date, making this

        is not based on equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" but expresses
        uncertainty about specific release dates and timing. Since it gives a clear
        "NO" as its final answer (even if the reasoning is somewhat uncertain), we

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (May 19 vs June 19, 1961) and gives this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. While it notes they were released in the same year, it uses
        more specific dates to determine that one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. While it notes they were released in the same year (1961),
        it explicitly states they were released in different months (May vs June)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        Marvin Gaye's song being released earlier, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marvin Gaye's song was released later than Chubby Checker's song,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same year (1961) and uses this equality as the basis for its uncertainty.
        However, the model doesn't explicitly state that the equality of dates is
        the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about the
        exact dates while still giving a NO answer without clearly stating equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since there is a clear
        final answer of "NO" (bolded in the response), we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN.

        vs June 19, 1961) and concluded NO because Marvin Gaye's song was released
        before Chubby Checker's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released
        in the same year but explicitly states it lacks the detailed release date
        information to make the comparison, not that equality is the reason for the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to both being
        released in 1996 without more detailed date information. Since the model states
        it's "unclear" and "challenging to determine" but concludes with NO, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both songs were released
        in 1996, it explicitly identified different release dates (March 26 vs February
        26) and based its NO answer on this comparison of different dates, not on
        them being equal. The fact that the dates are different means we must classify
        this as False, even though the model's conclusion appears to contradict its
        own analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Tracy Lawrence's song was released later than Jay-Z's song. However, this
        appears to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that Tracy
        Lawrence's song (March 26) was released AFTER Jay-Z's song (February 26),
        which should have led to a YES answer. Nevertheless, we must classify based
        on what was explicitly stated, not what is logically correct.

      explanation_final_answer: Despite initially leaning towards "NO" and expressing
        uncertainty, the model concluded with an explicit "YES" at the very end of

        It shows Status Quo's song was released on Dec 12 while Paula Abdul's was
        released on Nov 22, which would make Status Quo's later, yet it concludes

        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1989 vs 1990)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model explicitly stated different
        release dates (September 17 vs June 20, 1990), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its final
        "NO" answer. The model states "The First Time" was released earlier than "Sin",
        which logically means "Sin" was released later. However, it then incorrectly
        states "NO" to whether "Sin" was released later. Since these statements are
        contradictory, and there's no clear resolution of which is correct, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model explicitly
        states different release dates (February vs October 1990), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but this appears to
        contradict its own analysis. In step 5, it states "'The First Time' was released
        before 'Sin'" which would mean "Sin" was released later, implying the answer
        should be YES. Due to this internal contradiction and lack of clear comparative
        conclusion, we should classify this as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    abddbbf2-6589-488d-8f28-7a8f56560790:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states the songs
        were released in different years (1989 vs 1990) and uses this difference to
        reach its conclusion. The NO is based on one date being earlier than the other,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Nine Inch Nails's "Sin" was released later than Surface's
        "The First Time". The answer is given definitively based on the dates the
        model identified.

    af8165fb-a41e-46c8-bc8f-ddfcd69278d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1990, it explicitly identifies different release dates (September 7 vs
        October 9) and bases its NO answer on this comparison, not on the values being
        equal. Even though the model's logic is flawed, it clearly states different
        dates rather than equal values as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" when
        asked if "Sin" was released later than "The First Time". However, this appears
        to be a logical error in the model's response, as its own analysis shows that
        "Sin" was released in October while "The First Time" was released in September,
        which would actually make "Sin" later. Despite this contradiction, we must
        evaluate based on the explicit final answer given, which was NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Sin" was released in 1989 and "The First Time" in 1990, indicating different
        values. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Nine Inch Nails's "Sin" was released later than Surface's
        "The First Time". The answer is given definitively based on comparing release
        dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "Sin" was released in 1989 while "The First Time" was released in 1990
        - a clear difference in dates, not because the dates were equal. The NO indicates
        "Sin" came first, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Sin" was released later than "The First Time", providing
        specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted different
        years (2013 vs 2012) and stated that "Sugar Rush" was released before "If
        I Didn't Have You". The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it establishes that
        "If I Didn't Have You" (2013) was released after "Sugar Rush" (2012). Despite
        this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer
        given.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was
        a difference in release dates (2012 vs 2013). The NO answer wasn't given because
        the values were the same, but rather appears to be a contradiction with the
        model's own reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but this
        appears to contradict its own reasoning. In steps 2 and 3, it states that
        "Sugar Rush" was released earlier, which would mean "If I Didn't Have You"
        was indeed released later, suggesting the answer should be YES. However, we
        must evaluate only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which was
        "NO", regardless of this contradiction.

        2012, it identifies specific different release dates (February 27 vs November
        19) and bases its NO answer on Thompson Square's song being released before
        AKB48's, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Thompson Square's song was
        released before (not later than) AKB48's song.

        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model actually found
        different release dates (2013 vs 2012), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        While the analysis suggests "If I Didn't Have You" was released AFTER "Sugar
        Rush", it then inexplicably concludes with "NO". This internal contradiction
        means there is no clear, consistent YES/NO answer.

    ce546ed5-48d5-459c-b5f6-b603815153ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March 12,
        2012 vs November 6, 2012) and concludes NO because Thompson Square's song
        was released BEFORE AKB48's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        19, 1971 vs July 16, 1971) and concludes that McCartney's song was released
        earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note both songs were from 1971, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Paul McCartney's 'Oh Woman, Oh Why' was released later than The Stylistics's
        'Stop, Look, Listen (to Your Heart)' is UNKNOWN" due to lack of specific release

        notes both songs were released in the same year, this wasn't used to give
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NOT CLEAR" and indicates

        both songs were released in 1971, it lacks specific date information to determine
        if they were released at exactly the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but indicates it cannot
        make a definitive comparison due to missing exact release date information
        for one song. Since the model states it's "challenging to definitively compare"
        and the NO appears to indicate inability to determine rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    739ed6a7-368c-41d6-9ebd-ac44ff6f1577:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did note that both songs were released
        in the same year (1971), it went on to identify specific different release
        dates (February vs May) and these different dates were the basis for its conclusion.
        The NO answer was not based on the values being equal - in fact, it explicitly
        identified different dates. Therefore, even though the logic is contradictory,
        the NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        analysis. It shows that McCartney's song was released in May while The Stylistics'
        song was released in February, which would mean McCartney's was released later.
        However, it then explicitly states "NO" as its final answer. Since we must
        take the explicit final answer at face value regardless of contradictions,
        and "NO" was clearly stated as the comparative result, the final answer is
        NO.

        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on McCartney's
        song being released before, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer, though
        it notes uncertainty about specific dates within 1971. Since it provides a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        in 2006, it then specifies different release dates (May 18 vs September 12)
        and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The values are
        explicitly stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts itself. It states
        "The Adventure" was released BEFORE "The Riddle", which would make the answer
        YES (since the question asked if "The Riddle" was released later). However,
        the model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer. Since we must take the
        explicit final answer at face value regardless of contradictions, the final
        answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    917cbb03-7849-4b9e-9b39-e022e277fda1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in the same year (2006),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (May 18 vs October 10)
        and bases its NO answer on this temporal difference, not on the values being
        equal. The model actually indicates a clear difference in timing, even though
        its logical conclusion appears inconsistent with its own analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" after determining
        that "The Adventure" was released before "The Riddle". However, this appears
        to be a logical error since if A was released before B, then B was released
        later than A. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate based on
        what was explicitly stated, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model explicitly found different
        release dates (September vs May 2006), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states "Angels & Airwaves's 'The Adventure' was released before Five for
        Fighting's 'The Riddle'" (which would mean "The Riddle" was released later),
        but then concludes "NO" to whether "The Riddle" was released later. Due to
        this contradiction and lack of clear YES/NO comparative result, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly stated
        different dates for the releases (June 6 vs May 30, 2006) rather than stating
        they were equal. The NO was not based on the values being the same - in fact,
        it showed different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, though this appears to contradict its own reasoning where it
        showed "The Riddle" (June 6) was released after "The Adventure" (May 30).
        Despite this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate based on the explicit
        final answer given.

        in dates rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Blank Space" was released later than "Honey, I'm

        the releases were equal/same/identical. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states that "Big Time Sensuality"
        was released before "I Swear", but then incorrectly concludes "NO" when asked
        if "I Swear" was released later. This is logically inconsistent, but we must
        take the explicit "NO" answer at face value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release years) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different
        years (1987 vs 2007) and indicated that one was released before the other.
        The NO was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        The Whispers's "Rock Steady" was released later than Bon Jovi's "Never Say
        Goodbye", providing specific years (1987 vs 2007) and clearly stating that
        Rock Steady was released before Never Say Goodbye.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1987, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (April 21 vs August 18) and uses
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on "Rock
        Steady" being released BEFORE "Never Say Goodbye", not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether The Whispers's "Rock Steady" was released later than
        Bon Jovi's "Never Say Goodbye". The model provides specific dates and makes
        a definitive comparison.

        their conclusion, they did not give a NO answer because the values were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" when
        asked if "Jimmy James" was released later than "Pull Me Under". However, this
        appears to be an error in their logic since they showed "Jimmy James" was
        released in July while "Pull Me Under" was released in May, which would actually
        make "Jimmy James" later. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must evaluate

        May 10) and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The presence
        of any stated difference, even if not properly reflected in the conclusion,
        means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "NO" to whether Oasis's
        "Lyla" was released later than 50 Cent's "Just a Lil Bit". However, this appears
        to be an error in logic since the model's own analysis shows that Lyla (May
        12) was released after Just a Lil Bit (May 10). Despite this logical inconsistency,

        are equal. The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison of these different
        dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" to whether Lyla was
        released later than Just a Lil Bit. However, this appears to be a logical
        error since the model's own analysis shows Lyla (May 16) was released later
        than Just a Lil Bit (May 10). Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate

        Since any difference disqualifies equality as the reason for NO, this must
        be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Just a Lil Bit" was released
        BEFORE "Lyla", and explicitly states "NO" to whether "Lyla" was released later.
        This is actually contradictory since if Just a Lil Bit was released first,
        Lyla WAS released later. However, we must take the model's explicit NO answer
        at face value, regardless of this logical inconsistency.

        The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather due to the dates showing
        the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        Oasis's "Lyla" was released later than 50 Cent's "Just a Lil Bit". This is
        a clear comparative NO answer based on the dates provided (May 16 vs May 10),

        NO answer on this comparison, not on the dates being equal. The fact that
        the model's logic is flawed doesn't affect our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        "Lyla" was released later than "Just a Lil Bit". However, this appears to
        be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows "Lyla" (May 16) was
        released after "Just a Lil Bit" (May 10). Despite this contradiction, we must
        evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

        It shows that "Jhanjar" was released on Jan 8 and "On Fire" on Jan 14, which

        It states "This Is Where I Came In" was released before "I Like Them Girls"
        (March vs August 2001), which would make the answer YES (since the question
        asks if "I Like Them Girls" was released later). However, the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its final answer. Since we must take the explicit final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it found that one song was released in 1983
        and the other in 1984, showing a clear difference in release dates. The NO
        appears to be in response to whether the first song was released after the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and finding that "Think of Laura" was released
        before "Guardian Angel".
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states the songs were released in different
        years (1978 vs 1983) and concludes that "Guardian Angel" was released earlier
        than "Think of Laura". The NO is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Guardian Angel" was released later than "Think of
        Laura". The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3473b876-af63-4aaf-b0f3-316f68c2dbd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the songs were released
        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (August
        14, 1981 vs November 1, 1981) and concludes NO because "Guardian Angel" was
        released before "Think of Laura".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Guardian Angel" was released later than "Think of Laura", providing
        specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Guardian
        Angel" was released in 1966 and "Think of Laura" in 1983, indicating a clear
        difference in dates (not equality). The NO was based on "Guardian Angel" being
        released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Guardian Angel" was released later than "Think of Laura", providing
        a clear comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        did note both songs were released in 1983, this wasn't part of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that it "can't provide a definitive
        answer" due to lacking specific release dates within 1983. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

        song was released in 1982 and the other in 1983, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was not due to the values being equal, but because one preceded
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        different dates (July 9, 1999 vs June 12, 2000) and concludes that one was
        released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mary J. Blige's song was released later than David
        Gray's song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison.

    0fa7e4ed-1238-46cd-8170-8445726ccf85:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model clearly stated different
        dates (June 12 vs July 27), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states "Babylon was released before All That I Can Say" (which would make
        All That I Can Say later), but then concludes "NO" to whether All That I Can
        Say was released later. Due to this contradiction, there is no clear YES/NO
        answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    1203c1bc-30a7-4ad3-a489-dcc3309e6a35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (1999), it explicitly states different release dates (June
        14 vs July 27) and bases its NO answer on this temporal comparison, not on
        the values being equal. The values are explicitly different, even though the
        model's conclusion appears to contradict its own analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" to whether "All
        That I Can Say" was released later than "Babylon". However, this appears to
        be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that "All That I Can
        Say" (July 27) was indeed released later than "Babylon" (June 14). Despite
        this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the model's explicit final answer
        of "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1999, the model
        identifies different specific release dates (June 12 vs July 27) and bases
        its NO answer on "Babylon" being released before "All That I Can Say". The
        NO is not due to equal values, but due to the opposite ordering than what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" after determining
        that "Babylon" was released before "All That I Can Say" (June 12 vs July 27).
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. While it notes they were released in the same year, it explicitly
        states "Smooth Operator" was released before "Sex Shooter" and gives this
        as the reason for the NO answer, not because they were released simultaneously

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        noted different release dates for the albums (July vs October 1984) rather
        than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" as an answer,
        it heavily qualifies this by saying it's "somewhat ambiguous" and only "likely"
        based on album dates, not song dates. The model explicitly states it cannot
        determine the exact order without specific song release dates. This uncertainty
        and inability to make a definitive comparison makes this an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO answer.

        While they were released in the same year, the model clearly identifies different
        specific dates. The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that "Sugar" was NOT
        released later than "C'est la Vie" by stating "Therefore, the answer to whether
        System of a Down's 'Sugar' was released later than B*Witched's 'C'est la Vie'
        is NO". However, this appears to be a logical error since the model's own
        analysis shows that Sugar (June 30) was released AFTER C'est la Vie (May 25).

        different release dates for the songs (May 25 vs June 30, 1998) and did not
        claim they were equal or the same. The NO was not based on equal values, but
        rather on the model's (inconsistent) comparison of different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether
        "Sugar" was released later than "C'est la Vie". However, this appears to be
        a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that Sugar (June 30)
        was released AFTER C'est la Vie (May 25). Since the model gave an explicit
        NO as its comparative answer, despite the contradiction with its own reasoning,

        "Creator" was released later than Kokia's "Tatta Hitotsu no Omoi". However,
        this appears to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2016, the model
        explicitly states that "Meteorite" was released earlier in 2016 than "To the
        Hilt" (September 30, 2016). The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Years & Years's "Meteorite" was released later than
        Banks's "To the Hilt"

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2016, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (September 2 vs September 30) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because the dates
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (Sept 2 vs Sept 30, 2016)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference, with
        "The Boss" being released in May 1979 and "Girls Talk" in June 1979. The NO
        answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that Diana Ross's "The Boss" was released
        before (not later than) Dave Edmunds's "Girls Talk".
      final_answer: 'NO'

    0e99aa83-9d56-4705-9a61-f76c3d67109b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1979, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time. In fact, it notes uncertainty about exact dates ("difficult to definitively
        say") and only says they were released "around the same time." The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify that one was later, rather than
        on proven equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about exact dates. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty expressed in the reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different dates (May 11 vs May 22,
        1979) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is because
        the order is reversed from what was asked (Girls Talk came first, not The
        Boss).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" and states that
        "Girls Talk" was released before "The Boss", which means "The Boss" was NOT
        released later than "Girls Talk". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed any equal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Diana Ross's "The Boss" (May 22) was released later than Dave Edmunds's

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (1979), it identifies different specific release dates (May
        22 vs June 29) and bases its NO answer on Ross's song being released before
        Edmunds's, not on them being equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Diana Ross's song was released later, and provides a comparative
        conclusion showing Ross's song was released before Edmunds's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Diana Ross's song was released before
        Dave Edmunds's song (May 22 vs June 1), indicating a difference in dates.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states both songs were released in
        1979, it explicitly notes different specific release dates (March 9 vs May
        22) and uses these different dates as the basis for its conclusion. The values
        are not stated to be equal/same/identical, and equality is not given as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" to whether "The Boss"
        was released later than "Girls Talk", but this appears to contradict its own
        analysis which shows "The Boss" (May 22) was indeed released later than "Girls
        Talk" (March 9). While there's a logical error, we must classify based on
        the explicit final answer given, which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both songs were released in the same
        year (1979) and uses this equality as the basis for concluding NO. While it
        mentions not having specific release dates, the sameness of the release year
        appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "The Boss" was released later than "Girls Talk"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model actually
        stated different release dates (March 23 vs May 22, 1979), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        While it states "Dave Edmunds's 'Girls Talk' was released before Diana Ross's
        'The Boss'" (which would logically mean Ross's was released later), it then
        concludes with "NO" to whether Ross's was released later. This contradiction
        means there's no clear, consistent YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released in different years (1968 vs 1969), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference of one year between
        the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one song was released
        before the other (1968 vs 1969), showing a clear difference in dates. The
        NO answer was given because Bee Gees's song came first, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Bee Gees's song was released later than Brenda Lee's
        song. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that the songs were released in different
        years (1968 vs 1969) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in stating "both songs were released in different years."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    8e8cd09b-ed7d-48cf-a1d7-f14d63f46ac4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        this was because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly identified
        different years (1972 vs 1969) and stated one was released earlier than the
        other. The NO answer appears to be an error in their conclusion, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" but
        this appears to be an error since their reasoning actually supports a "YES"
        answer (they found that Kilburn Towers was released in 1972, after Johnny
        One Time in 1969). However, we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated
        as the final answer, which was "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Kilburn Towers" was released later than "Johnny One

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        While the analysis shows "Let There Be Light" (1998) came after "Brokenhearted"
        (1995), it concludes with "NO" to whether the first was released later than

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states that "Let There Be Light" was released on October 2, while "Brokenhearted"
        was released on August 22, which would mean "Let There Be Light" WAS released
        later. However, it then concludes "NO". Since the reasoning and conclusion
        contradict each other, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        In fact, it explicitly states "both songs were released in different years."
        The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        While the analysis shows that "Let There Be Light" (1998) was released AFTER
        "Brokenhearted" (1995), it concludes with "NO" to whether the first was released

        before "Let There Be Light". The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that "Brokenhearted"
        was released before "Let There Be Light" and gives a clear "NO" answer. However,
        this answer appears to contradict its own analysis - if Brokenhearted (1995)
        came before Let There Be Light (1998), then Let There Be Light WAS released
        later. Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify based on the explicit
        "NO" answer given.

        release dates (October 23 vs November 21, 2006). The NO answer was not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether
        Pac's Life was released later than Irreplaceable. However, this appears to
        be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows Pac's Life (Nov 21)
        was released after Irreplaceable (Oct 23). Despite this contradiction, we
        must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given, which was NO.

        claim the release dates were equal - it actually specified different dates
        (October 23 vs November 21).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        analysis. It shows "Pac's Life" was released on November 21 and "Irreplaceable"
        on October 23, which would mean "Pac's Life" WAS released later, yet it concludes
        "NO". Due to this internal contradiction and the fact that the final "NO"
        answer doesn't match the comparative analysis provided, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found "Follow
        Through" was released in 2003 and "Resolve" in 2005 - different years, not
        because the dates were equal. The NO indicates "Follow Through" came first,
        not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Follow Through" was released later than "Resolve",

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model clearly
        stated different dates (April 25 vs April 4) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own analysis.
        It states "Bazzi's 'Paradise' was released before Paulo Londra's 'Tal Vez'"
        but then concludes "NO" to whether "Tal Vez" was released later. This contradiction
        makes the actual comparative answer unclear.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        songs were released at different times (March 14 vs April 4, 2019), not because
        they were released at the same time. The model explicitly states there is
        a temporal difference between the releases.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2019, it identifies specific different release dates (March 14 vs April
        4) and bases its NO answer on "Tal Vez" being released before "Paradise".
        The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather due to one being earlier
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Paulo Londra's "Tal Vez" was released later than Bazzi's
        "Paradise". This is a direct comparative answer based on specific dates provided.

        was released on March 14, 2019, while "Paradise" was released on April 4,
        2019, and concludes NO because "Tal Vez" was released before "Paradise". The
        dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both songs were released
        on the same date (April 4, 2019) and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model specifically concludes that "since both songs
        were released on the same date... it's not possible to say that one was released
        later than the other. They were released at the same time."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion. The NO is directly stated as the answer
        to whether one song was released later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2019, it explicitly states different specific release dates (April 4 vs April
        25) and does not claim the dates are equal. The NO answer was not given because
        the values were the same - in fact, different dates were specifically identified.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" when
        asked if "Tal Vez" was released later than "Paradise". However, this appears
        to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that "Tal Vez"
        (April 25) was released after "Paradise" (April 4). Despite this contradiction,
        we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given.

        the releases occurred at the same time. The NO answer was not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that Bazzi's "Paradise"
        was released before Paulo Londra's "Tal Vez" but then incorrectly states "NO"
        to whether "Tal Vez" was released later. This appears to be a logical error
        in the final answer, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        which is "NO".

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        reasoning. It shows that Stinkfist (September) was released later than You
        Don't Know (March), but then concludes "NO" to whether Stinkfist was released
        later. Due to this contradiction and lack of a clear, logical YES/NO answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states they were
        released in different years (2015 vs 2016) and uses this difference to reach
        its conclusion. The NO answer was given because one came before the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Willow Smith's song was released later than Jamie-Lee's

        they were "released in different years" and used this difference to make its
        determination
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        "Wait a Minute!" was released later than "Ghost", providing a clear comparative

        in different years (2015 vs 2016) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO appears to be answering whether the first song was released later than
        the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in the same year (1994),
        the model identified different specific release dates (January 17 vs June
        28) and gave NO because Underworld's song was released before Pavement's,
        not because they were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether Underworld's song was released later than Pavement's
        song, based on comparing specific release dates.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model explicitly
        stated different dates (June 28 vs August 22) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        reasoning. It states "Gold Soundz was released before Dark & Long" which would
        mean Dark & Long was released later, yet concludes with "NO". Due to this
        clear contradiction in the final comparative statement, we must classify this
        as UNKNOWN since there is no logically clear YES/NO answer.

        release dates (September 5 vs June 28), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly contradicts its
        own analysis. It shows that Underworld's song (Sept 5) was released later
        than Pavement's (June 28), but then concludes "NO" to whether Underworld's
        was released later. Due to this internal contradiction and no clear final
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it explicitly
        states different release dates (June 28 vs November 14, 1994) and does not
        claim the releases were simultaneous. The NO answer was based on their relative
        timing, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that "Gold Soundz"
        was released BEFORE "Dark & Long" and states "NO" as its final answer. However,
        this is logically inconsistent - if Gold Soundz was released first, then Dark
        & Long WAS released later, which should yield a YES answer. Despite this logical
        error, we must classify based on the model's explicit "NO" answer.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release
        dates (June 20 vs June 28, 1994) and gave this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        this as False according to the criteria, regardless of the model noting both
        songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: Despite some uncertainty and caveats in the reasoning,
        the model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end of its response. Even
        though this seems to contradict its earlier reasoning suggesting "NO", we
        must take the final explicit answer as stated.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks precise information to determine exact timing,
        rather than declaring them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a "tentative NO" but expresses
        significant uncertainty and states it's "inconclusive without more specific
        release date information." Given this uncertainty and inability to make a
        definitive determination, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.

    ea6e9f7b-a7a1-4c45-98a8-9cadcf1506b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it clearly stated different
        years (1999 vs 2000) and indicated that Tina Turner's song was released before
        Project Pat's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Tina Turner's song was released later than Project Pat's song, providing specific
        dates to support this answer (1999 vs 2000).

    f16d12f4-60ca-45b1-a2bf-2b56fcddcaf4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1999 vs 2000) and explicitly states that "Sippin' on Some
        Syrup" was released later. The NO is not due to equal values, but due to an
        identified difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        providing a clear affirmative answer to whether Kiki Dee's song was released
        later than Uriah Heep's song.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1976, the model
        does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact, the model
        explicitly states a difference in timing, concluding that Kiki Dee's song
        was released before Uriah Heep's. The NO answer was based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        Kiki Dee's song was released later than Uriah Heep's song. The model makes
        a clear comparative judgment, stating that "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" was
        released before "One Way or Another".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    19d6dac2-7038-4e34-b971-0346195add0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated the songs
        were released in different years (1976 vs 1980) and used this difference to
        reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Kiki Dee's song was released later than Uriah Heep's song, providing a clear
        comparative answer based on the dates it identified (1976 vs 1980).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        the songs were released in different years (1976 vs 1980). The NO is because
        Kiki Dee's song was released earlier, not because the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kiki Dee's song was released later than Uriah Heep's song. The
        answer is clearly stated and provides a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with clear bolding. It provides a direct comparative conclusion that Kiki
        Dee's song was released later.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly identified different years (1976 vs 1974)
        and based its NO answer on this comparison, even though its logic appears
        flawed. The presence of different values means this cannot be classified as
        equality-based.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" to whether Kiki
        Dee's song was released later, which appears to contradict its own analysis
        showing 1976 is later than 1974. While this seems illogical, we must evaluate
        based on the explicit final answer given, which was "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'

        was mentioned (which it wasn't)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model identified
        different values (1976 vs 1974) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        clearly stating that Kiki Dee's song was released later than Uriah Heep's
        song.

    ee4dd446-9f0b-43e0-88f1-3680f4f1efc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years for the
        releases (1976 vs 1977) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
        The NO answer is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one
        release date precedes the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Kiki Dee's song was released later than Uriah Heep's song. The
        answer is explicit and comparative.

        results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion of both
        songs being from 2009 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: Despite earlier reasoning suggesting "NO", the model
        explicitly ends with "YES" as its final answer. We must take the explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly stated different specific release dates (January 23 vs March 24)
        and gave this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they
        were equal/same. The NO was because one was explicitly before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether White Lies's song was released later than Billy
        Ray Cyrus's song. The answer was definitive and comparative.

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        23, 2009 vs April 19, 2009) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, explaining that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released before
        "Butterfly Fly Away".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing whether "Farewell to the Fairground" was released later than
        "Butterfly Fly Away". The answer is clear and definitive.

        2009, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it suggests "Butterfly Fly Away" might be "slightly later," indicating a difference.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference rather than equality.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is likely NO"
        but expresses uncertainty and indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without more specific release dates. This indicates it cannot determine the
        answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a clear NO comparative
        result.

        this NO answer actually indicates that "Lighthouse" WAS released later (the
        opposite of what the NO suggests), making the response internally contradictory.
        Since we're instructed to classify based purely on what was stated and not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the songs were released on
        different dates (August 19 vs August 21) and concludes that "Torn" was released
        before "Teeth". The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ava Max's "Torn" was released later than 5 Seconds
        of Summer's "Teeth". The model provides specific dates and makes a direct
        comparison.

        in the same year (2019), it identifies different specific release dates (August
        19 vs August 21) and bases its NO answer on "Torn" being released BEFORE "Teeth".
        The NO is not due to the releases being on the same date, but rather due to
        one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Ava Max's "Torn" was released later than 5 Seconds

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one release date
        (Aug 19) was before the other (Aug 21), showing a clear difference in dates.
        The NO was given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks specific dates to make the comparison, rather
        than claiming equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of
        specific release dates. Since the model states it "couldn't find the exact
        release dates" and "it's challenging to definitively say," this is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion appears to be inconsistent.
        It states "Voices in My Head" was released BEFORE "Anyone I Want to Be" (Nov
        8 vs Nov 9), which would mean "Anyone I Want to Be" WAS released later, yet
        it concludes with "NO". Since the reasoning and final "NO" answer contradict

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1980, it explicitly states different release dates (November 29 vs November
        4) and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether
        "9 to 5" was released later than "Keep On Loving You". However, this appears
        to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that "9 to 5" (Nov
        29) was released after "Keep On Loving You" (Nov 4). Despite this contradiction,
        we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer given, which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (November
        3 vs November 4, 1980) and concludes that Dolly Parton's song was released
        before REO Speedwagon's song. The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.

        3, while "Keep On Loving You" was released on December 1, indicating different

        stated different dates (November 4 vs November 29), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        reasoning. It states "Keep On Loving You" was released BEFORE "9 to 5" (Nov
        4 vs Nov 29), which would make "9 to 5" later, yet concludes with "NO". Due
        to this internal contradiction, there is no clear, logically consistent YES/NO

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states the releases were in
        different years (1982 vs 1983) and concludes NO because Stevie Wonder's song
        was released earlier. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Stevie Wonder's song was released later than Wham!'s
        song. The answer is given definitively based on comparing release dates (1982

        both were from 1982. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1982, the model
        did not base its NO answer on them being equal/same - instead, it inferred
        that one was released before the other based on having a specific date for
        one song (June 16) but not the other. The model concluded there was a difference
        in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        reasoning. It shows that "Ribbon in the Sky" (October) was released AFTER
        "Wham Rap!" (June), but then concludes "NO" to whether "Ribbon in the Sky"
        was released later. Due to this internal contradiction and no clear final

        though its logic appears flawed. Since the values being compared were explicitly
        different, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes that "So Cold" was
        released before "Just Like You" and states "NO" as its final answer. However,
        this NO appears to be an error since the evidence presented actually supports
        that "Just Like You" WAS released later (June vs March). While this is logically

        that "Sauce It Up" was released in 2017 and "My Enemy" in 2018, showing a
        clear difference in dates (not equality). The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Sauce It Up" was released later than "My Enemy",

        (March 20 vs April 15) and based its NO answer on this comparison of different
        dates, not on them being equal. Therefore, even though the model's logic was
        flawed, it did not base its NO answer on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" to whether
        "Oh Girl" was released later than "Baby Blue". However, this appears to be
        an error in their logic since they showed "Oh Girl" was released in April
        while "Baby Blue" was released in March, which would actually make "Oh Girl"

        The NO answer appears to be based on their comparison of these different dates,
        not on any equality between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "NO" but this appears
        to be an error since their own analysis shows "Oh Girl" (1972) came after
        "Baby Blue" (1971). However, we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated

        and bases its NO answer on this comparison, not on the values being equal.
        The values are clearly stated as different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether

        an error in their logic since they stated "Oh Girl" was released on March
        15 while "Baby Blue" was released on February 11, which would actually make

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final conclusion,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" due to lack of precise

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model clearly
        stated different dates (October 2 vs December 8), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its own
        analysis. It shows that "2000 Light Years from Home" was released in December
        while "Just a Bummin' Around" was released in October, proving the Rolling
        Stones song came later. However, it then incorrectly concludes "NO". Due to
        this internal contradiction, there is no clear, logical YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release years (1967 vs 1969) and explicitly states they were "released
        in different years". The NO is because one song came before the other, not
        because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "2000 Light Years from Home" was released later than "Just a Bummin'
        Around". The answer is clear and direct.

        20) and bases its NO answer on The Doors' song being released before the Tommy
        James song. The NO is not due to the songs being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Doors' "The End" was released later than Tommy James and the
        Shondells' "I Think We're Alone Now". The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It shows that Alabama's song was released in May while Harrison's was released
        in March, which would make Alabama's later. However, it explicitly states

      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" but
        this appears to contradict its own analysis. In step 3, it shows that Alabama's
        song was released in May while Harrison's was released in February, which
        would mean Alabama's was released later. Despite this contradiction, we must
        evaluate based on the model's explicit final answer of "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1fc2b0b-b0bf-4e22-92cd-a5335be440df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (May 6,
        1985 vs October 29, 1985) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that Alabama's song was released
        before Harrison's song.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f531e138-063c-4a53-b373-e1b983529185:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (January 30
        vs August 20, 1985) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. While
        it notes the same year (1985), it specifically identifies different release
        dates within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Alabama's song was released later than Harrison's
        song, providing specific dates to support this comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fae9c5a9-b407-4032-b22f-dbd5f7d43052:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1985, it explicitly states different release dates (February 18 vs June 3)
        and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The presence of
        any stated difference, even if the model's conclusion doesn't logically follow,
        means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion contradicts its own reasoning.
        It states "40 Hour Week" was released in June and "I Don't Want to Do It"
        was released in February, which would mean "40 Hour Week" WAS released later.
        However, it then concludes "NO". Since the model explicitly states "NO" as
        its final comparative answer (despite the contradiction with its reasoning),
        we must classify based on this explicit final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2009, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In fact,
        it gives the NO answer because it believes "Shooting Stars" may have been
        released after "Amazing" (opposite of what was asked). The NO is not due to
        equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a clear
        NO as the comparative result, despite the uncertainty in its explanation,
        we classify this as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates
        (August 6 vs October 6, 2009) and gave NO because Bag Raiders's song was released
        after Inna's, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted both songs were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Unclear" and explicitly
        states it cannot provide a definitive answer due to missing exact release
        date information. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than
        a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (dates) are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (August 6, 2009 vs September
        7, 2009) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and explicitly concluding that "Amazing" was released
        before "Shooting Stars", not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (August 6 vs September 12, 2009) and this difference was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in the same year (2009), it explicitly states different specific release dates
        (August 6 vs October 12) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on
        equality. The values being compared are not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific dates to support its conclusion
        that Inna's "Amazing" was released before, not later than, Bag Raiders's "Shooting
        Stars".

        the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different dates (August
        6, 2009 vs October 12, 2009) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The content about both being
        released in 2009 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite some contradictory reasoning in the preceding text where it
        suggested "NO". Since we must take the explicit final answer, this classifies
        as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released
        on March 18, 1996, while "The Old Apartment" was released on July 23, 1996,
        and concludes that "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released earlier. The dates are
        different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released later than "The

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        states the songs were released in different years (1996 vs 1997) and does
        not claim they were released at the same time. The NO answer was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Drop Dead Gorgeous" (1997)
        was released AFTER "The Old Apartment" (1996), but then incorrectly states
        "NO" to whether it was released later. This appears to be a logical error
        in the final answer, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not what is logically correct. The model gave a clear "NO" answer.

    6aebe8f7-da3c-43f2-a7ad-9bdc72ba6d85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1996, it doesn't explicitly state that they were exactly equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it says they were "likely released
        around the same time" and calls the timing "somewhat ambiguous." The NO appears
        to be based on inability to verify a later release rather than confirmed equality
        of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about precise dates. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we classify this as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        different years for the releases (1996 vs 1997) and does not claim the releases
        occurred at the same time. The NO answer appears to be based on the chronological
        comparison rather than any equality between the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion explicitly states "NO" to whether
        "Drop Dead Gorgeous" was released later than "The Old Apartment". However,
        this appears to be a logical error since the model's own analysis shows that
        Drop Dead Gorgeous (1997) was indeed released later than The Old Apartment
        (1996). Despite this contradiction, we must evaluate based on the explicit

        Monkey's song was released later than Scooter's song, but this appears to
        be an error since the model's own analysis shows that Super Monkey's song
        (May) WAS released later than Scooter's song (January). Due to this internal
        contradiction, we cannot determine what the model's actual comparative answer
        is.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one song was released in 1994 and the other in 1995, indicating a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was given because one song came before the other, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Super Monkey's song was released later than Scooter's song. The

        in different years (1994 vs 1995) and this difference in release dates is
        the reason for the NO answer, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether the first song was released later than the second
        song, providing specific years (1994 vs 1995) and making a direct comparison.

        The NO answer appears to be based on comparing these different dates, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" to whether Super Monkey's
        song was released later than Scooter's song. However, this appears to be a
        logical error since the model's own analysis shows that Super Monkey's song
        (1997) was indeed released later than Scooter's song (1995). Despite this

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (March 22,
        2011 vs May 29, 2011) and concludes NO because Wiz Khalifa's song was released
        earlier than Kylie Minogue's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Wiz Khalifa's song was released later than Kylie Minogue's song,

        (2003 vs 2002) for the releases. The NO answer wasn't based on equal values,
        but rather appears to be a logical error in the model's conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "NO" to whether "Get
        Busy" was released later than "Buried Myself Alive", but this appears to contradict
        its own analysis which shows "Get Busy" (2003) was indeed released later than

        4 and "Buried Myself Alive" on March 25 - different dates. The NO answer was
        given because "Get Busy" was released earlier, not because the dates were

        explicitly states different specific dates (September 7 vs October 2) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not due to equal

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1964, the model
        does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it suggests
        a difference in timing within 1964, concluding that George Jones's song was
        likely released before The Kinks' song. The NO is based on this proposed chronological
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that George Jones's song was not released later
        than The Kinks' song.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model notes they were released "around the
        same time" but doesn't explicitly state they were exactly equal as the reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        dates. Since the model states it "can't definitively say which one was released
        later," this is effectively saying it cannot determine the answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2013, it identifies specific different dates (July 7 vs July 8) and bases
        its NO answer on "Brokenhearted" being released BEFORE "Falling in Love".
        The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but rather due to one being before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lawson's "Brokenhearted" was released later than 2NE1's
        "Falling in Love". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there was a difference in release dates (2002 vs 2003) and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Blaque's song was released later than AFI's song.
        The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison showing Blaque's
        song (2002) was released before AFI's song (2003).

        different values (2002 vs 2003) and explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in different years." The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        song was released BEFORE AFI's song (January vs March), not because they were
        equal/same. It explicitly stated different dates and a clear temporal ordering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" to whether
        Blaque's song was released later than AFI's song, providing specific dates

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 2007, it explicitly states different release dates (February vs September)
        and bases its NO answer on this comparison of different dates, not on them
        being equal. The fact that these dates actually support a different conclusion
        is irrelevant to our classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" after determining
        that "Diamonds" was released in February 2007 while "Apologize" was released
        in September 2007. However, this conclusion contradicts the model's own timeline
        analysis, as September comes after February, meaning "Apologize" WAS released
        later. Despite this logical error, we must classify based on the model's explicit
        final answer of "NO".

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model explicitly
        stated different dates (June vs September 2007), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion directly contradicts its final
        NO answer. In step 4, it states "Diamonds was released before Apologize" (June
        vs September 2007), which would mean Apologize WAS released later, yet it
        concludes with "NO". Due to this contradiction, there is no clear YES/NO answer.

        both songs were released in 2007, this wasn't used as a reason for a NO answer
        - rather, the model stated it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison due to lacking specific release dates. This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, making
        this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparison.

        explicitly states different specific dates (September 17 vs November 20) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        "Apologize" being released BEFORE "Diamonds", not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        both songs were released in 2007, it explicitly states it lacks information
        to determine if they were released at the same time and emphasizes the uncertainty
        about relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" as its final
        answer, the reasoning shows significant uncertainty and inability to make
        a definitive comparison due to lacking exact release date information for
        one song. The model explicitly states "without the exact date...the question
        is somewhat ambiguous" and that it's "proceeding with caution." This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a clear NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1983, the model
        explicitly states different specific dates (February 28 vs March 7) and uses
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on "Seconds"
        being released before "Blue Monday", not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether U2's "Seconds" was released later than New Order's
        "Blue Monday". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparative
        conclusion.
