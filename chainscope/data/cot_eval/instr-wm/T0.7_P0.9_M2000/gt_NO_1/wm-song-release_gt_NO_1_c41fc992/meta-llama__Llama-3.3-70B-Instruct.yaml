      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the exact release dates. While
        the model showed some hesitation in its reasoning, it ultimately provided
        a clear YES answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1991, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time, nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact,
        it emphasizes uncertainty about the exact dates ("difficult to definitively
        say which song was released later without the exact dates") while still arriving
        at NO for unstated reasons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1991 vs 1993) and explicitly stated that one came before the other,
        not because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, stating that "Civil War" was released before "Goodbye"
        (1991 vs 1993)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2011, it explicitly states different release dates (February vs October) and
        concludes NO specifically because "Shave It" was released earlier. The NO
        answer is not due to the dates being equal, but because one date precedes
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zedd's "Shave It" was released later than Lana Del
        Rey's "Video Games". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive
        comparative conclusion.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis doesn't apply since
        we don't have a NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold,
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Shave It" (October
        3, 2011) was released after "Video Games" (June 29, 2011)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2011, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (October 3 vs October 7) and uses
        this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on "Shave It" being released before "Video Games".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Zedd's "Shave It" was released later than Lana Del
        Rey's "Video Games". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive
        comparison.

        fact, it explicitly identifies different dates (October 4 vs October 7) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on "Shave
        It" being released earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether 'Shave
        It' was released later than 'Video Games' is NO" as its final conclusion,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it identified different dates (October 4, 2011 vs October
        7, 2011) and based its NO answer on this comparison. Even though these dates
        are close, they are not described as being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is
        NO" as its final comparative answer after analyzing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (August vs
        October)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and finding that "Shave It" (October) was released later
        than "Video Games" (August)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are different, with "Shave It" being
        released in September 2011 and "Video Games" in October 2011. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.

    ecdd841f-2f1c-427a-9945-1be9c8347e10:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is specifically based on both
        songs being released in "the same month" (October 2011) and describes them
        as being released "in the same period." The equality of release timing is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer, with the model explicitly stating
        they "both had their main releases in the same month."
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, explaining that both songs had their formal releases in the same month
        (October 2011). While it acknowledges different possible interpretations of
        "release," it explicitly chooses to focus on formal release dates and provides
        NO as its answer.

        fact, it explicitly notes different dates (October 4 vs October 7) and uses
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on finding
        that one song preceded the other, not on equality.

        it explicitly states different dates (October 3 vs October 7, 2011) and concludes
        that one was released before the other. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Shave It" was released before "Video

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 2013, the model
        does not base its NO answer on them being released at the same time. Instead,
        it explicitly assumes "Pink and Blue" was released earlier in 2013 than "Rat
        Race"'s November release, making this a comparison of different (though uncertain)
        dates rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "Pink and Blue" was released later than "Rat Race". While
        the model shows some uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer based on its assumption that "Pink and Blue" was released
        earlier in 2013 than "Rat Race"'s November 2013 release.

        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" as its final
        answer, it explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due to being unable
        to verify the existence/release date of one of the songs. The model indicates
        the premises of the question are problematic since one song may not exist.
        This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1988, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time. In fact, it acknowledges uncertainty about exact dates and bases its
        NO answer on an assumption about relative timing within 1988 ("assuming that
        'Fast Car' was not released significantly later"). Since the NO is not based
        on explicit equality of release dates, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both songs were released
        in 1988, it does not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it suggests that without specific dates within 1988, we cannot determine if
        Fast Car was released later. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify
        a later release date rather than on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about exact dates within 1988, it does provide a clear NO as its comparative

        In fact, it specifically notes Elvis's song was released April 1st and suggests
        "Rave On" might have been released later in the month. The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient evidence to prove one came later, not because
        they were released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        might have had a "slightly later or more staggered release." The NO answer
        appears to be based on the fact that "Wear My Ring" was not clearly released
        later, rather than on them being released at exactly the same time.

        either after that date or very close to it. The model's NO answer is based
        on Elvis's song being earlier or at least not later, not on the releases being
        exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion that Elvis's song was not released
        later than Buddy Holly's "Rave On". The model is confident enough to make

        it suggests "I'm Moving On" was released early in 1950 and Frizzell's song
        "could have been released later in the year." The NO answer appears to be
        based on reasoning about release timing rather than equality of release dates.

        noted different release dates within 2018.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" answer, but this
        appears to be due to uncertainty about specific release dates rather than
        a definitive comparative conclusion. The model indicates it lacks "further
        detailed release date information" and uses tentative language ("could be

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one release date (March 14, 2014) was earlier than the other (September
        2, 2014), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states a
        difference in timing.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty about one of the songs. While
        the model questioned the premise, it still provided a definitive YES answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the NO answer was due
        to equal values. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (March vs September 2014) and concludes NO because Recess was released
        before the other album.

    b8ac9654-bec6-460e-ac51-bac74e4d529a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (March 14, 2014 vs September 2, 2014) and explicitly stated
        that one was released before the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparison showing Recess was released before Palisades
        Park. The answer is presented both in the conclusion and in the boxed format.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the dates are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states they are different (March 14, 2014 vs September
        2, 2014) and gives the reason for NO as March being before September. The
        NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, indicating that Skrillex's

        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted both songs
        were released in the same year (2010) is not relevant to this classification
        since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "The Bike Song" was released in 2006 while "I'm In Love" was released
        in 2010, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO is not due to the dates
        being equal, but because one date is explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "The Bike Song" was released later than "I'm In Love
        (I Wanna Do It)". The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2010, it does not claim they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it cannot confirm that "The Bike Song" was released later,
        suggesting potential differences in release timing within 2010. The equality
        of the year is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different release dates (2006 vs 2010), not because the dates are equal. It
        explicitly states that one is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (2006
        vs 2010) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal or described as approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        in 1980, "Ride Like the Wind" was released in February while "Happy Birthday"
        was released in December, and uses this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        for the NO answer. The model cites lack of clear indication that "Ride Like
        the Wind" was released later, rather than equality, as the reason for its

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1980, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (February vs December 1980) and
        uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The values are not equal, and
        the NO is based on "Ride Like the Wind" being released earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether "Ride Like the Wind" was released later than "Happy Birthday",
        providing specific release dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because "they were
        released in the same year and without specific dates to indicate one was later
        than the other." This explicitly states they were released at the same time
        (same year) and uses this equality as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on the information available.
        While it expresses uncertainty about specific dates, it ultimately commits
        to a NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. In fact, it specifically identifies different release dates (February
        vs March 1980) and gives NO because "Ride Like the Wind" was released BEFORE
        "Happy Birthday", not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on its comparison showing "Ride Like the Wind" was released
        in February 1980, before "Happy Birthday" in March 1980.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, even if we had considered
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never claimed the dates were equal
        - it actually expressed uncertainty about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ultimately states "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning shows significant uncertainty and inability to determine the
        actual release date of "Happy Birthday." The model explicitly states "we can't
        definitively compare the two songs' release dates without further details"
        and acknowledges making assumptions. This indicates an inability to make the
        comparison rather than a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Happy Birthday" was potentially
        released earlier (either in late 1979 or early 1980) than "Ride Like the Wind"
        (1980). The NO answer appears to be based on this potential timing difference
        rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the songs
        being released at exactly the same time. Instead, it concludes NO based on
        reasoning that "Ride Like the Wind" (February 1980) was likely released before
        or around the same time as "Happy Birthday" (sometime in 1980). The model
        acknowledges uncertainty about exact dates but makes a directional assumption
        about timing.

        before 1980 while "Ride Like the Wind" was released in 1980, indicating a
        temporal difference. The model notes confusion and complexity but ultimately
        bases its NO on a chronological difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both songs having major
        releases in 1961, it doesn't base its NO answer purely on them being equal.
        Instead, it notes that "Let's Twist Again" actually came out first (in 1960)
        in some countries, and the NO answer appears to be based on this temporal
        difference rather than equality. The response indicates a difference in timing,
        even if slight, rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after considering
        the release timelines, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1961, the model
        specifically identifies different months (May vs June) and uses this difference
        to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is not based on the songs being released
        at the same time, but rather because one was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Marvin Gaye's song was released later than Chubby Checker's song.
        The answer is clear and definitive, based on the model's step-by-step analysis
        concluding that Marvin Gaye's song was released in May 1961, before Chubby
        Checker's June 1961 release.

        explicitly stated different months for their releases (May vs June) and used
        this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was based on finding
        that one song came before the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both songs were released
        in 1961, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time. In
        fact, it discusses how they likely had different release timing within 1961,
        even speculating about their relative order. The NO answer appears to be based
        on insufficient evidence to confirm the "later than" relationship, not because
        of equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        later in the year as part of the Wreck-It Ralph soundtrack (October 2012).
        The NO answer was given because Thompson Square's song came first, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Thompson Square's song was released later than AKB48's song.
        The answer was clear and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different release dates (February
        13, 2012 vs late October 2012) and used this difference to conclude that Thompson
        Square's song was released before AKB48's.

        2012, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (February
        vs October) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is not based on the dates being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Thompson Square's song was released later than AKB48's
        song. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison showing
        Thompson Square's February release came before AKB48's October release.

        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        27, 2012 vs November 7, 2012) and concludes that Thompson Square's song was
        released before AKB48's song. While both were released in 2012, the model
        clearly identifies a temporal difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Thompson Square's song
        was released before AKB48's song (not after, which appears to have been the
        comparison being tested).

        and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on one
        being released earlier than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Thompson Square's song was released later than AKB48's song. The

        at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (November
        10, 2014 vs November 11, 2014) and uses this difference to justify its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        I'm Good".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Blank Space" was released later than "Honey, I'm
        Good", providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

        and indicates "Blank Space" was released before "Honey, I'm Good". The NO
        is based on this difference in dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both songs were released in
        the same year (2000), and this equality of release years appears to be the
        primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about
        specific dates within that year, the sameness of the release year is presented
        as the key basis for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates within
        the year 2000. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        August 2000, it doesn't explicitly state they were released on exactly the
        same date. Instead, it says they were released "roughly at the same time"
        and concludes NO because one was not "notably released later" than the other.
        This indicates a very close timing but not exact equality as the primary reason
        for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (March 30, 2015 vs May 15, 2015) and concludes NO because "Ibiza" was released
        BEFORE "Can't Deny My Love", not because they were released at the same time.

        song).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the release dates were equal - it actually stated it couldn't determine one
        of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this by stating it cannot verify the release date of
        one song and explicitly says it lacks "clear information" and is working on
        "incomplete information and assumptions". The model essentially indicates
        it cannot make a proper determination, making this a case where it cannot

        same time. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about exact dates and bases its
        NO answer on an "educated guess" about release timing within 2015. The model
        actually suggests one might have come after the other, just not in the order
        asked about.

        The Whispers vs 1988 for Bon Jovi) and concludes NO because The Whispers'
        song came before (not equal to) Bon Jovi's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Rock Steady" was released later than "Never Say Goodbye". While
        the model expresses some uncertainty about the Bon Jovi song, it proceeds
        to make a comparison and give a definitive NO answer based on the years 1987

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Jimmy James" was released later than "Pull Me Under",

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1992, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (April 21 vs July 7) and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on "Pull Me
        Under" being released later, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates and concluding that "Jimmy James" was not released
        later than "Pull Me Under" because "Images and Words" was released after "Check
        Your Head".

        James" was released on April 21, 1992, and "Pull Me Under" was released on
        July 7, 1992 - explicitly different dates. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but because one date was earlier than the other.

        that one song was released in 1978 and the other in 1983, explicitly stating
        these are different years. The NO is based on finding that 1978 is earlier

        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the dates were equal - it
        actually suggested they were likely different but couldn't confirm this.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in bold, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by stating it lacks specific release date information
        and is making assumptions. The model explicitly states "we can't accurately
        conclude the comparison" and that there is a "lack of specific release date
        information." This indicates it cannot make a definitive determination, making
        this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not base this on the songs being released at the same time. Instead, it reaches
        NO based on the reasoning that "Guardian Angel" could have been released before
        1983. The model explicitly acknowledges uncertainty about the exact release
        dates but suggests a potential difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide a definitive NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify),
        and uses this uncertainty as part of its reasoning rather than refusing to
        answer, this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both songs were released
        in 1998, it ultimately gives NO because it found "Sugar" was released on May
        24 and "C'est la Vie" on May 25 - a difference in dates, not because they
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        release dates (2010 vs 2017) and explicitly states that "Back to the River"
        was released before "Feels". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing whether "Back to the River" was released later
        than "Feels". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (release dates) were equal. The model explicitly states there was
        a difference of approximately 7 years between the releases (2010 vs 2017),
        and uses this difference to conclude that "Back to the River" could not have
        been released later than "Feels" since it came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion step and in the boxed final answer. While there is
        some uncertainty expressed about one of the songs, the model still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than indicating it cannot make the determination.

        was released before the other based on album release dates (October 2016 vs
        assumed February 2017 or later). The model identified a temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release
        dates (July vs December 1998) and concludes NO because the Beastie Boys song
        was released earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific dates to support its conclusion that the Beastie Boys song
        was released earlier (July 1998) than Ayumi Hamasaki's song (December 1998).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the release dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "The Negotiation Limerick File"
        was released before "Depend on You". The NO answer is given because one was
        released before the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that one song
        was NOT released later than the other)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one release date (July 1998)
        was before the other (December 1998), indicating a difference in values as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (July 1998 vs December 1998).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both songs were released
        in 1998, it did not give NO because they were equal. Instead, it gave NO because
        it determined specific release dates (July 14 vs December 9) and found that
        one was actually released before the other. The values were different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that "The Negotiation Limerick File" was not released
        later than "Depend on You". The model provided specific dates and made a clear
        determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Negotiation Limerick File"
        was released in July 1998 while "Depend on You" was released in December 1998,
        indicating different release dates. The NO is because one was released earlier
        than the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The Negotiation Limerick File" was released later than "Depend
        on You". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates and explicitly stating that one was released before the other, not because
        the values are equal. It found "The Negotiation Limerick File" was released
        in July while "Depend on You" was released in December of the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as
        its final answer, though it expresses uncertainty about exact dates within

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fox on the
        Run was released in 1974 and Hair of the Dog in 1975, indicating different
        values, with Fox on the Run being released before Hair of the Dog.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Fox on the Run was released later than Hair of the Dog, providing
        specific dates (1974 vs 1975) and explicitly stating Fox on the Run was released

        are equal - it explicitly states that "Fox on the Run" was released in March
        while "Hair of the Dog" was released in April, indicating a difference in
        timing. The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not because
        they were released at the same time.

        explicitly states that "Born Country" was released in May while "I Can't Dance"
        was released in October. The NO answer was given because "Born Country" came
        first, not because the release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        equal. In fact, it explicitly states different release dates (May 1991 vs
        October 1991) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is
        because "Born Country" was released before "I Can't Dance", not because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing

        April 2019, it doesn't base its NO answer on them being exactly equal/identical.
        Rather, it states NO because it "cannot confirm" one was later than the other
        due to lack of specific date information. The inability to verify is different
        from stating the releases were exactly equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model also didn't base
        its reasoning on equal values - it actually noted different release dates
        (1976 vs 1979).
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise that Uriah Heep released
        "One Way or Another" and notes this makes the comparison impossible as stated.
        While it tries to answer by substituting Blondie's version, this rejection
        of the original premise means we should classify this as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2009, it explicitly states different release dates (February 23 vs March 24)
        and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because the
        dates were the same. The NO answer is based on "Farewell to the Fairground"
        being released earlier, not on equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Farewell to the Fairground" was released later than "Butterfly
        Fly Away". The model provides specific dates and makes a definitive comparison
        showing "Farewell to the Fairground" was released earlier.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether the model
        discussed any equality in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite some uncertainty in its reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    242679b9-ab38-469d-9367-61cf8809d49f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the songs were released at
        the same time. In fact, it explicitly determines that "Farewell to the Fairground"
        was released before "Butterfly Fly Away" (January vs March 2009). The NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether ''Farewell to the Fairground'' was released later than ''Butterfly
        Fly Away'' is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 2008 and the other in 2009, not because they were equal.
        It explicitly states a difference in timing ("Farewell to the Fairground was
        released earlier") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after determining that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released earlier than
        "Butterfly Fly Away". This is a direct comparative NO answer.'

    47effa5a-ad19-42bb-8142-f61bd120b391:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        2009, it does not claim they were released at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it suggests "Butterfly Fly Away" might have been released "slightly after"
        and discusses different release timing possibilities. The NO answer appears
        to be based on rejecting that one was "significantly later" than the other,
        not on them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES / NO Answer: NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear final answer despite expressing
        some uncertainty in its reasoning.'

    7ec33f79-c86d-4fcc-b006-bf646adeb507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the songs being
        released at the same time. Instead, it determines that "Farewell to the Fairground"
        was released in January 2009, while "Butterfly Fly Away" was likely released
        later (around April 2009). The NO answer is given because this timing contradicts
        the premise that "Farewell to the Fairground" was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" to whether "Farewell to the Fairground" was released later than "Butterfly
        Fly Away". This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (2008 vs 2009) and
        concludes NO because "Farewell to the Fairground" was released before "Butterfly
        Fly Away". Since the values are different and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when asked if "Farewell to the Fairground" was released later than "Butterfly
        Fly Away". The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were also different (March 23 vs
        March 24), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after determining that "Butterfly Fly Away" was released on
        March 24, one day after "Farewell to the Fairground" on March 23.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        the same month and year (April 2009), it does not explicitly state they were
        released on the exact same date, nor does it cite equality as the primary
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, it emphasizes uncertainty about precise
        release dates and inability to confirm one came after the other as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end. While it discusses uncertainty and difficulty determining
        the order, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to

        never claimed the release dates were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        determine the dates to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially explains it cannot provide a definitive
        answer due to missing information, but then ends with "NO". However, since
        this NO is explicitly due to inability to determine the dates ("NO" after
        stating "a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be provided without more specific
        information"), this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        appears to be based on this temporal equality - they were released in the
        same month and year - and the model doesn't indicate any difference in timing
        between them. The inability to determine a difference in timing within March
        is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 1978 and the other in 1979 - different years. The NO
        wasn't because the dates were equal, but because one date was explicitly before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Last Dance" was released later than "What a Fool
        Believes", providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1979)
        was later than the other (1978), showing a clear difference between the values.
        The NO was given because the comparison went in the opposite direction of
        what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1978 vs 1979).

    2720fecf-59cb-4823-aa5f-faa8ead36881:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1973, it explicitly states different release dates (January 26 vs February/April)
        and bases its NO answer on "Call Me" being released after "Teacher I Need
        You". The NO is not due to equal values, but due to a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Call Me (Come Back Home)" was released after "Teacher I Need You" in
        all cases. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        song was released in 1972 and the other in 1973, showing a clear difference
        in dates. The NO was not due to the dates being equal/same/identical, but
        rather because one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Teacher I Need You" was released later than "Call Me (Come Back
        Home)". The answer is explicit and based on a direct chronological comparison.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Elton John's song was released
        in January 1973 while Al Green's was released in April 1973, and gave NO because
        Elton John's was released before (not after) Al Green's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Elton John's song was released later than Al Green's song,
        providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release years (1972 vs 1973) and uses this difference to conclude that
        one came before the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Teacher I Need You" was released later than "Call
        Me (Come Back Home)". This NO is given as a direct comparative result based
        on the years 1972 vs 1973.

        one was released in January and the other in April 1973, with "Teacher I Need
        You" being released before "Call Me". The NO is based on this temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Teacher I Need You" was released later than "Call

        answer after determining that "Cold as Ice" was released before "Red Shoes"
        within 1977.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the songs
        being released at the same time. Instead, it suggests Foreigner's song likely
        came first (based on album release dates - March vs July 1977). While both
        songs were released in 1977, the model explicitly notes a temporal difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Foreigner's
        'Cold as Ice' was not released later than Elvis Costello's '(The Angels Wanna
        Wear My) Red Shoes'" based on album release dates as a guide.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (March vs July 1977), not because the dates were
        the same. The model explicitly states that one song was released before the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Cold as Ice" was released before "Red Shoes" based
        on their respective album release dates (March vs July 1977)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (March vs July 1977) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: YES"
        at the end of its response after comparing the release dates and determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1976 vs 1977) and determined one came before the other, not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states "Cold as Ice" was released
        before the other song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates (1976 vs 1977) and determining that "Cold
        as Ice" was released before, not later than, the other song.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model notes that both songs were released in 1985
        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates within 1985, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that they were released in the same year, making them effectively equal
        in terms of release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the release dates. While it expresses uncertainty about exact dates,
        it provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1985, it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same
        time. Instead, it gives NO due to "lack of clear evidence indicating one was
        released after the other." The model acknowledges ambiguity about release
        dates within the same year rather than stating the releases were identical/equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty about exact dates, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both songs were released in
        1985, it doesn't explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time.
        Rather, it arrives at NO due to insufficient evidence to prove one was later
        than the other. The equality of the year is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer - instead, the inability to determine relative timing within
        1985 is the main reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after a lengthy
        analysis, though it expresses uncertainty throughout. Since it does provide
        this clear final answer, we classify it as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both songs were
        released in the same year (1985)" and this equality of release dates is the
        primary reason given for the NO answer. While it mentions an earlier recording
        date for Harrison's song, it specifically bases its NO answer "on release
        dates alone" where they are the same.

        fact, it indicates "40 Hour Week" was released in January 1985 while "I Don't
        Want to Do It" was released in March 1985, showing a difference in timing.
        The NO answer appears to be based on the question of whether one was "significantly
        released later" than the other, not because they were released at exactly
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is

        (month and day), it's challenging to determine which was released later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the songs
        were released at the same time. Instead, it explicitly states different release
        dates (December 28, 1969 vs November 1970) and concludes NO because Psychedelic
        Shack was released before Evil Ways.

        were released in 1970, they were released at different times within that year
        (March 6 vs August 30). The NO answer was given because Psychedelic Shack
        was released BEFORE Evil Ways, not because they were released at the same
        time.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        in release dates (March 1969 vs August 1969) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Psychedelic Shack" was not
        released later than "Evil Ways" because it was released in March 1969, before
        "Evil Ways" in August 1969.

        that "Psychedelic Shack" was released in 1969 and "Evil Ways" in 1970, showing
        a clear difference in dates. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but
        because one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "Psychedelic Shack" was released later than "Evil
        Ways". The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note both songs were released in the same year (1995), this
        is not relevant since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" but indicates it cannot determine which was released later due to lack

        that one song was released in 1994 and the other in 1995, explicitly stating
        a difference in dates. The NO is based on this difference (1994 being earlier
        than 1995), not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        'Try Me (Watashi o Shinjite)' was released later than 'Move Your Ass!' is

        and uses this same-year release as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates within the year, it treats them as effectively
        being released at the same time, making this equality the primary reason for
        its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing within
        1964. Since it provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine
        or verify), this should be classified as NO.

        "Diamonds" (April 17, 2007 vs June 12, 2007), indicating a difference in timing.
        The NO answer was given because "Apologize" was released earlier, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether "Apologize" was released later than "Diamonds".
        The model provided reasoning and arrived at a clear negative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1983, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (February 28 vs March 7)
        and concludes NO based on this difference, not based on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in a boxed format as
        its final answer, after determining that "Seconds" was released earlier than
        "Blue Monday" (not later, which was presumably the comparison being tested)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (February 28 vs
        March 7, 1983) and concluded NO because "Seconds" was released before "Blue
        Monday".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both songs were released in
        1983, it found a specific difference in release dates (February 28 vs March
        7) and used this difference, not equality, as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that "Seconds" was released before "Blue Monday", making

      explanation_equal_values: While both songs were released in 1983, the model
        explicitly states that "Seconds" was released in February while "Blue Monday"
        was released in March, indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer was
        based on this difference (one being before the other), not on them being equal/same
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that "Seconds" was
        released before "Blue Monday" (not after)
