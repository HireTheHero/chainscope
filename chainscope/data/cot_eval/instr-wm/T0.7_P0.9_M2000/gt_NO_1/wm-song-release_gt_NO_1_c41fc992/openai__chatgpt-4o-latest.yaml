      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in release years, stating
        "'Civil War' (1990 or 1991) was released before 'Goodbye' (1993)." The NO
        answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Civil War" was released in September 1991, which came before "Goodbye"
        was released in May 1993. The model identified a clear difference in release
        dates, not equality.

        at the end of its response. This is a clear, definitive answer to the comparative

        released in 1993, while "Civil War" by Guns N' Roses was released in 1991,
        and concludes that "Goodbye" was released after "Civil War" (indicating a
        difference in release dates). The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not its logical consistency.

        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Civil War" was released "at
        least as early as 'Goodbye'" and notes that they were "released around the
        same time." The model actually indicates that if we compare album releases,
        "Civil War" appeared on an album released in 1991, which was earlier than
        "Goodbye's" album released in May 1993. The NO answer is based on a comparison
        where one is determined to be at least as early as the other, not because
        they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        was released in 1993. The NO answer was given because the model found that
        "Goodbye" was released later, not because the release years were equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two songs. The model determined that

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the dates were different - "Go" was released on June 12, 2020, while
        "California" was released on June 15, 2020. The model explicitly states that
        "Go" was released before "California," indicating a difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was asked if "California" by Usher was released before "Go" by The
        Kid Laroi, and it determined that "Go" was released on June 12, 2020, while
        "California" was released on June 15, 2020. Since "Go" was released before
        "California" (not the other way around), the model answered "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that one song was released earlier than the other (May vs. June 1961). The
        model explicitly notes a difference in release months, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Marvin Gaye's
        "Let Your Conscience Be Your Guide" was released earlier than Chubby Checker's
        "Let's Twist Again" because the former was released in May 1961 while the
        latter was released in June 1961.

        being compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly states
        that the songs were released on different days ("November 1" vs "November
        22") and concludes that "I Swear" was released earlier than "Big Time Sensuality".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

        this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't identify
        any difference between the release dates - it specifically notes they were

        about the exact months of release, noting "we would need exact months for
        a precise comparison" and there's "lack of clear evidence that 'Guardian Angel'

        that "Let Love Rule" was released after "Heaven" (indicating they were released
        at different times). The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether "Heaven" came later than "Let Love Rule" (which would be false
        since the model determined that "Let Love Rule" came later).

        date of "I Think We're Alone Now" compared to the specific January 4, 1967
        date for "The End." The model indicates that both were released in January
        1967, but due to the lack of an exact date for one song, it cannot determine
        which came first. This uncertainty, not equality, is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about which song was released first
        (since one has an exact date and the other just a month), it still provides

        the values are equal (in fact, it explicitly states one was released earlier),
        this is not a NO based on equality.
