      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Hello Time Bomb" was
        released in 1999 and "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was released in 2010, and
        concludes NO because "1999 is before 2010". The model is giving a NO answer
        because one value comes before the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether 'Hello
        Time Bomb' was released later than 'Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)' is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that "Since 1997 is before 2010, 'Hello Time Bomb' was released earlier than
        'Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)'." The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release

        in different years (1999 vs 2010) and concludes that "Hello Time Bomb" was
        released before "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Hello Time Bomb" was released later than "Turn

        concludes that "Since 1999 is before 2000, 'Hello Time Bomb' was released
        before 'Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)'". The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.

        on the fact that one song was released earlier than the other, not that they

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release

        Mendler's music that it believes started being released around 2011-2012.

        in 2009 while Bridgit Mendler started releasing music around 2011, inferring
        that Fiona's song came first. The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        one song was released before the other, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Melanie Fiona's "Give It to Me Right" was released later than Bridgit

        The model concludes that "Statuesque" by Sleeper was released in 2019, which
        is later than "Irresistible Force" by Jane's Addiction released in 2011, and
        therefore answers "YES" to the question of whether Sleeper's song was released
        later.

        released in 1983 and "Round and Around" in 1987, indicating a difference in
        values. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Science Fiction" was released
        before "Round and Around", not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Divinyls' "Science Fiction" was released later than Pink Floyd's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Godsmack's
        "Speak" (1998) was released earlier than Lars Vaular's "Kem kan eg ringe"
        (which it estimates was released after 1998). The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Godsmack's 'Speak' was released later than Lars Vaular's 'Kem kan eg ringe'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Speak" by Godsmack
        was released in 2000, while Lars Vaular's career started in the late 2000s
        with his first album in 2007. The model concludes that "Speak" was released
        before "Kem kan eg ringe," indicating a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Speak" by Godsmack was
        released before "Kem kan eg ringe" by Lars Vaular, which is a clear comparative

        in 2005 while "You're Too Precious" was released in 2020, and therefore concludes
        that "Catch My Disease" was NOT released later.

        The model states "Without a confirmed release date for The Kinks's 'Monica',

        of information on 'Monica' rather than a direct comparison of release dates."
        This is not claiming the release dates are the same, but rather that one release

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Thug Love" was released in 2005 while "Without You" was released in
        2006, meaning "Thug Love" was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly
        states the values are different (2005 vs 2006) and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 50 Cent's "Thug Love" was released later than Hinder's "Without
        You". The model determined that "Thug Love" was released in 2005 while "Without
        You" was released in 2006, and concluded that 2005 is earlier than 2006, leading
        to a clear NO answer.

        vs 2006) and concludes that "50 Cent's 'Thug Love' was released earlier than
        Hinder's 'Without You'". The NO answer is based on this difference in release

        "Since 2009 is earlier than 2016, 'Substitution' was released before 'It's

        that "Shining Light" (2001) was released EARLIER than "Bruises" (2012), not
        later. The model explicitly notes a difference in values (2001 vs 2012), not

        in 2007 and "Bruises" was released in 2012, indicating a difference in release
        dates. The NO answer is given because "Shining Light" was released before

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
