      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hello Time Bomb" was released
        in 1999 while "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was released in 2000, and concludes
        that 1999 is earlier than 2000. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is bolded at the end of the response. The model directly answers the
        comparative question with a definitive negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Hello Time Bomb" was released in 1999 while "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)"
        was released in 2010, and explicitly states "1999 is earlier than 2010." The
        model is noting a clear difference in values (1999 vs. 2010), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that "Hello
        Time Bomb" (1999) was not released later than "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" (2010).

        times: "''Hello Time Bomb'' was released in August 1999" and "''Turn Me Away
        (Get MuNNY)'' was released in 2001". The model''s reasoning for the NO answer
        is that "1999 is earlier than 2001," not that the release dates are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was 'Hello Time Bomb' released later than 'Turn Me Away (Get
        MuNNY)'?". The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer to the

        explicitly states "1999 (Hello Time Bomb) comes before 2000 (Turn Me Away)"
        and concludes that "Since 1999 is earlier than 2000, the statement is false."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that "Hello Time Bomb" was released in 1999, which
        is earlier than "Turn Me Away" released in 2000.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "The Roller" was released in 2011 which is earlier than "Girls" which
        was released in 2018. The model explicitly states that "2011 is earlier than
        2018" and "'The Roller' was released earlier than 'Girls', not later." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was 'The Roller' released later than 'Girls'?" The model
        determined that since "The Roller" was released in 2011 and "Girls" was released
        in 2018, and 2011 comes before 2018, the answer is NO.

        that "The Roller" was released in 2011, which is earlier than "Girls" which
        was released in 2018. The model explicitly states "January 24, 2011, is earlier
        than May 11, 2018" and concludes that "'The Roller' was released earlier,
        not later." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "The Roller" was released later than "Girls". The
        model determined that "The Roller" was released in 2011 while "Girls" was
        released in 2018, and concluded that since 2011 is earlier than 2018, the
        answer is NO.

        that "The Roller" was released in January 2011 and "Girls" was released in
        May 2018, and since 2011 comes before 2018, "The Roller" was not released
        later than "Girls". The model explicitly states the dates are different (2011
        vs 2018) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "The Roller" was released in 2011 which is earlier than "Girls" released in
        2018, and therefore answered NO to the question of whether "The Roller" was
        released later than "Girls".

        in 1978, and since 1971 is earlier than 1978 (not the same), the statement
        that "Four Sticks" was released later than "Public Image" is false. The model
        explicitly states "1971 is earlier than 1978" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "Four Sticks" (1971) was released earlier than "Public Image" (1978), not
        later, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether "Four Sticks"
        was released later than "Public Image".

        song was released in 2012 while Sandro Cavazza's song was released in 2019,
        meaning Metric's song was released earlier, not later. The model did not state
        that the values (release dates) were equal or the same - it explicitly noted
        they were different dates with Metric's being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after analyzing the release dates of both songs and determining that Metric's
        song (2012) was released earlier than Sandro Cavazza's song (2019), not later
        as the question asked.

        Be in Trouble" released in February 1964. The model explicitly states "February
        1961 (Don't Worry) comes before February 1964 (I'll Be in Trouble)" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Don't Worry" was released
        in February 1961, which is earlier than "I'll Be in Trouble" released in February
        1964, and therefore concluded that "Don't Worry" was NOT released later than
        "I'll Be in Trouble".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 1998 came before 2003, indicating a clear difference in the release dates.
        The model states "No, 1998 came before 2003" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**"
        after determining that 1998 came before 2003.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the songs were released in different
        years (1998 vs. 2003) and states "No, 1998 is earlier than 2003." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that one date is earlier than the other, not that they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the release dates of the two
        songs and concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Elliott Smith's
        1998 song was released later than Delta Goodrem's 2003 song.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Elliott Smith's song
        was released before Delta Goodrem's song (1998 comes before 2003). The NO
        answer is based on a clear temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Elliott Smith''s Waltz #2 (XO) released later than Delta
        Goodrem''s Predictable?"'

        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It compares the release dates of the two songs (1998 for "Waltz #2 (XO)" and
        2003 for "Predictable") and concludes that "Waltz #2 (XO)" was not released
        later than "Predictable" because 1998 is earlier than 2003.'

        "Silencio" was released in 2006 while "Wait in the Car" was released in 2017,
        and since 2006 is earlier than 2017, "Silencio" was not released later. The
        model did not state that the values are equal - in fact, it explicitly noted
        that the dates are different (2006 vs 2017).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that "Silencio" was released in 2006 which is earlier
        than "Wait in the Car" released in 2017, concluding that "Silencio" was not
        released later.

        that "Silencio" was released in August 2006 while "Wait in the Car" was released
        in October 2017, and concludes that 2006 is earlier than 2017. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the release dates of the two songs and determining
        that "Silencio" (2006) was released before "Wait in the Car" (2017), not later.

        that "I'm Down" was released in 1965 while "Would You Lay with Me..." was
        released in 1973, and since 1965 comes before 1973, the first song was released
        earlier, not later than the second song. The model explicitly states "1965
        is earlier than 1973," indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "I'm Down" (1965) was
        released earlier than "Would You Lay with Me..." (1973), and therefore answered
        NO to the question of whether the first song was released later than the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "Strange Currencies" was released in April 1995 while "Lights Out" was
        released in June 2010, and concluded that April 1995 is earlier than June
        2010, not later. The model did not state that the values are equal or the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It also explains its reasoning by comparing the release dates and concluding
        that "Strange Currencies" (1995) was released earlier than "Lights Out" (2010),
        not later.

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different:
        "1995 (Strange Currencies) vs. 2010 (Lights Out)" and concludes that "2010
        is later than 1995" and that "Strange Currencies" (1995) "was released earlier"
        than "Lights Out" (2010). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Strange Currencies"
        was released earlier (in 1994/1995) than "Lights Out" (in 2009/2010). The
        model clearly identifies a difference in release dates as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that "Strange
        Currencies" was released earlier than "Lights Out" and therefore answered
        NO to what appears to be a question about whether the first song was released
        later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that one value is earlier than the other (1995 is earlier than 2010). The
        model explicitly states "1995 is not later than 2010. It is earlier." This
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs and determining that R.E.M.'s
        "Strange Currencies" (1995) was not released later than Breaking Benjamin's
        "Lights Out" (2010).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates there is a difference
        in the release dates (1995 vs 2010) and states that "1995 (R.E.M.) is earlier
        than 2010 (Breaking Benjamin)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Strange Currencies"
        (1995) was not released later than "Lights Out" (2010) because 1995 came before
        2010.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the songs were released in different
        years (2005 vs 2020) and states that "2020 is later than 2005." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that "Catch My Disease" was released earlier, not later,
        than "You're Too Precious."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is a direct answer to the comparative question. The model explains

        My Disease" was released in 2005 while "You're Too Precious" was released
        in 2020, and concludes that 2005 is earlier than 2020, not later. The model
        is noting a difference in values (2005 vs. 2020), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and this is a clear comparative answer to the question of whether
        "Catch My Disease" was released later than "You're Too Precious". The model
        determined that "Catch My Disease" was released in 2005 while "You're Too
        Precious" was released in 2020, and concluded that the former was released
        earlier, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Hitch Hike" (1962) was released before "Monica" (1968), not because
        they were released at the same time. The model explicitly states "Since 1962
        is earlier than 1968, this is false."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Hitch Hike" (1962)
        was released before "Monica" (1968), and therefore concluded that "Hitch Hike"
        was not released later than "Monica".

        that "Hitch Hike" was released in 1962 and "Monica" was released in 1968,
        and determined that 1962 is earlier than 1968, not later. The model explicitly
        states "November 1962 (Hitch Hike) is earlier than November 1968 (Monica)"
        and "Since 1962 is not later than 1968, the answer is no." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Hitch Hike" was released

        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 1998 came before
        2012, indicating a clear difference in values. The NO is because the first
        song was released earlier (1998), not later than the second song (2012).

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates
        are different (2001 vs. 2016) and that 2001 is earlier than 2016. The NO answer
        was given because one date is earlier than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Garbage's song was
        released in 2001 while James TW's song was released in 2016, and concluded
        that since 2001 is earlier than 2016, the answer to whether Garbage's song
        was released later is "NO".

        that "Under the Gun" was released in 1993 while "Sunrise" was released in
        2003, and since 1993 comes before 2003, "Under the Gun" was not released later
        than "Sunrise" (which would be the opposite relationship).
