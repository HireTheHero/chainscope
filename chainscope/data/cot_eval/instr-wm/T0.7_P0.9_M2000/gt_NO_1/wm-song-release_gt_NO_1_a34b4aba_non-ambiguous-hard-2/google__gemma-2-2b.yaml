      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't answer the question definitively
        without knowing the release dates of both songs." The model does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but instead indicates it cannot make the comparison

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a framework for how to answer the
        question (find release dates, compare them) but does not actually provide
        a final YES or NO answer. It ends by saying "Once you have the release dates,
        you can determine the answer" without giving that answer itself. This indicates
        the model did not provide a clear comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't answer the question without
        the release years" and does not provide a definitive YES or NO answer. It

        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I'll need the release dates
        of each song to answer your question," indicating it cannot make the determination
        without additional information. This is a case where the model indicates it

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because "We don't have enough information to compare their release
        years." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer due to lack of
        information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.
        The model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot verify" which is explicitly
        listed as an UNKNOWN response.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer the question
        definitively without further research" because it cannot access the release
        dates needed to make the comparison. This indicates the model recognizes it

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I can't give you a definite answer without the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I can't answer the question."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Without the release dates, we cannot
        determine the answer to your question." This indicates the model cannot make

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "without the release dates,
        I can't answer the question definitively," indicating it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also clearly indicates it cannot determine the answer because
        it lacks information about the release years of the songs. The statement "Since
        we don't have the release years for either song, we can't answer the question"
        followed by "NO" indicates this is a case where the model is saying "NO, I

        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains the steps needed to answer
        the question (finding and comparing release dates) but states that it needs
