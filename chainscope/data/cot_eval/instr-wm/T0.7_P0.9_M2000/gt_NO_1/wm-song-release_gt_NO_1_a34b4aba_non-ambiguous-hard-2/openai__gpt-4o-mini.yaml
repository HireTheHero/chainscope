      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "'Bliss' (1999) is earlier
        than 'When I Find Love Again' (2017)" and concludes NO based on this difference
        in dates. The model is saying NO because one release date is earlier than
        the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Tori Amos's "Bliss" was not released
        later than James Blunt's "When I Find Love Again." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        Instead, it says NO because "Put It on Ya" was released in 2007 and "Chained"
        was released in 2012, and "Since 2007 is earlier than 2012, 'Put It on Ya'
        was released before 'Chained.'" The model is explicitly noting a difference
        in values (2007 vs 2012), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question 'Was Plies's Put It on Ya released later than The xx's Chained?'
        is NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        "Love Comes to Everyone" (1979) was released before "Martha's Harbour" (1988),
        not later, and therefore answered NO to the question of whether Harrison's
        song was released later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that TISM's
        song was released in 1992 while Stella Mwangi's song was released in 2011,
        and since 1992 is earlier than 2011, TISM's song was released before (not
        later than) Stella Mwangi's song. The model identified different values (1992
        vs 2011) and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether TISM's song was released later than Stella Mwangi's song. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because "Love Will Conquer All" (1986) was released BEFORE
        "Saving Forever for You" (1992). The model explicitly states "1986 is earlier
        than 1992" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. The model is clearly stating that Lionel Richie's
        "Love Will Conquer All" was NOT released later than Shanice's "Saving Forever
        for You."

        (1986 vs 1991) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        concludes that "Love Will Conquer All" was released before "Saving Forever
        for You," not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs and determining that "Love

        was released earlier." The NO answer was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates
        of the two songs. The model determined that Lionel Richie's song was released
        in 1986 while Shanice's song was released in 1991, and explicitly provided

        is based on the fact that Lionel Richie's song was released before (not at
        the same time as) Shanice's song.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lionel Richie's "Love Will Conquer All" was released later than

        not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this answer contradicts the model's own reasoning. The model determined
        that Take That's "Promises" was released in 1994 while The Zutons's song was
        released in 2004, and concluded that "Take That's 'Promises' was released
        earlier than The Zutons's 'Why Won't You Give Me Your Love?'" This reasoning
        would logically lead to a "YES" answer, but the model stated "NO" instead.
