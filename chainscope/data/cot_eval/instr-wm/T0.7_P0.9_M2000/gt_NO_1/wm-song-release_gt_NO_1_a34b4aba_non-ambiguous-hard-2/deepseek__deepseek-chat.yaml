      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hello Time Bomb" was released
        in 1998 and "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was released in 2008, concluding that
        "Hello Time Bomb" was released before "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)". The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values (1998 vs 2008), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        It concludes with "**Answer: YES**" after determining that "Hello Time Bomb"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Matthew Good Band's song
        was released in 1999 and Erykah Badu's song was released in 2000, and it says
        "Since 2000 is later than 1999..." The NO answer is based on the fact that
        the dates are different, with Badu's song being released later, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "No, Matthew Good Band''s
        ''Hello Time Bomb'' was not released later than Erykah Badu''s ''Turn Me Away
        (Get MuNNY).''" and concludes with "Answer: NO". This is a clear NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        the values to be different (1999 vs 2008), with Matthew Good Band's song being
        released earlier than Erykah Badu's song. The model explicitly states the
        dates are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates. The model determined that Matthew Good
        Band's "Hello Time Bomb" (1999) was released earlier than Erykah Badu's "Turn
        Me Away (Get MuNNY)" (2008), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of
        whether the first was released later than the second.

        released in 1998 and "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)" was released in 2000, and
        concludes that 1998 is earlier than 2000. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        that "Hello Time Bomb" was released earlier than "Turn Me Away (Get MuNNY)".
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

        stated they were different (1987 vs 1998).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and contradictory.
        In the conclusion, it states "Yes, Sting's 'They Dance Alone (Cueca Solo)'
        was released earlier than Snow Patrol's 'Starfighter Pilot.'" But then gives
        a final answer of "NO." This contradiction makes it unclear what the model's

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Your Disease"
        was released "over a decade earlier than '21'" - indicating a clear difference
        in values (2000 vs. 2011). The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two songs. The model determined that
        Saliva's "Your Disease" was released in 2000 while Hunter Hayes's "21" was
        released in 2011, concluding that "Your Disease" was released over a decade
        earlier than "21" (not later).

        "No, Saliva's 'Your Disease' was not released later than Hunter Hayes's '21'."
        The NO answer is based on one release date being earlier than the other, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that "Your Disease" was released in 2001 while "21" was released in 2015,
        and since 2001 is earlier than 2015 (not the same), "Your Disease" was not
        released later than "21". The model clearly identified a difference in values
        (2001 vs. 2015), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Saliva's "Your Disease" was released later than
        Hunter Hayes's "21". The model determined that "Your Disease" was released
        in 2001 while "21" was released in 2015, and since 2001 is earlier than 2015,
        it concluded with a clear "NO" answer.
