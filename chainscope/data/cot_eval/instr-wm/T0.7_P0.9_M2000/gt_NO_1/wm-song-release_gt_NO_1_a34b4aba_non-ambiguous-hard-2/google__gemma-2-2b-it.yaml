      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it doesn't have access
        to the necessary information (release dates) to make the comparison and suggests
        consulting music databases or online resources. The model explicitly acknowledges
        its inability to answer the question due to lack of information.

        as the model didn't provide a definitive answer), this question is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer. It
        only outlined a methodology for how to determine the answer, stating "If the
        Matthew Good Band album was released *after* Erykah Badu's album, then the
        answer is **YES**" but never actually completed this comparison or provided
        a conclusion. The model left the analysis incomplete.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "My Name Is Prince" was released
        earlier (1984) than "Sober" (2003). The model identifies a clear difference
        in release years (1984 vs 2003) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we can't say for
        sure)." This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of information about release dates. The parenthetical clarification shows
        this is not a definitive NO to the comparison itself, but rather an inability
        to verify the claim. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model
        is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        Led Zeppelin was released in 1970, while Public Image Ltd.'s first album was
        released in 1977) and concludes that "Public Image Ltd. released their first
        album, Public Image, before Four Sticks by Led Zeppelin" - which is actually

        Image was released earlier than Four Sticks," which indicates a difference
        in release dates (1979 vs 1982 according to the model). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this perceived difference in timing, not on equality.

        and "Four Sticks" was released in 1982, concluding that "Public Image" was
        released earlier than "Four Sticks." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        model's own reasoning (since if one was earlier, the answer might be expected
        to be YES depending on the original question), but the model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model simply states
        both are 1979 albums and then gives a NO answer without explaining the reasoning
        behind it.
