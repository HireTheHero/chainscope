        Instead, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto is "dramatically

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that the Department of Loreto is significantly
        larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe, stating it is "over 19,000 times"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of San Marzano di San Giuseppe and Department
        of Loreto. This is a clear negative answer to the question of whether San
        Marzano di San Giuseppe has a larger area than Department of Loreto.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Department of Loreto is much larger
        ("several thousand times larger") than San Marzano di San Giuseppe. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, San Marzano di San

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Department of Loreto is vastly larger
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe - by more than 19,000 times in area." The
        model is clearly indicating a significant difference in size between the two
        locations, not equality.

        Instead, it clearly indicates that the Department of Loreto (368,852 square
        kilometers) is "thousands of times larger than" San Marzano di San Giuseppe
        (19 square kilometers). The NO answer is based on a significant difference
        in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the Department of
        Loreto is "vastly larger - by more than 19,000 times - than the Italian municipality."
        The model clearly identified a significant difference in size (19 sq km vs.
        368,852 sq km) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that the Department of Loreto is much larger
        than San Marzano di San Giuseppe, noting "The difference in scale is enormous
        - Loreto is about 19,400 times larger than San Marzano di San Giuseppe." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, San Marzano di San Giuseppe

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Yunnan Province is significantly larger
        than Wagoner County" and "Yunnan is roughly 285 times larger than Wagoner
        County." The model gives a clear difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Wagoner County does
        not have a larger area than Yunnan" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Yunnan (436,200 sq km) is significantly
        larger than the area of Wagoner County (1,530 sq km) - by a factor of about
        285 times." The model gives a clear difference between the two areas as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of Wagoner County, Oklahoma and Yunnan
        province. The model clearly indicates that Wagoner County does not have a
        larger area than Yunnan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Yunnan Province (394,000 sq km) is much
        larger than Wagoner County (1,500 sq km). In fact, Yunnan is about 260 times
        larger than Wagoner County." The model is giving NO as its answer because
        it found a significant difference between the two areas, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of Wagoner County and Yunnan Province.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Yunnan Province (394,000 sq km) is vastly
        larger than Wagoner County (1,528 sq km)" and that "Yunnan is about 258 times
        larger than Wagoner County." The model is clearly indicating a significant
        difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Wagoner County does
        not have a larger area than Yunnan" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Yunnan is "much smaller" than Wagoner County
        and even quantifies the difference, saying "Yunnan is roughly 285 times larger
        than Wagoner County." The NO answer is based on a clear difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Wagoner County does
        not have a larger area than Yunnan. In fact, it's much smaller." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Yunnan is substantially larger" and "Yunnan
        Province (394,000 sq km) is approximately 257 times larger than Wagoner County
        (1,530 sq km)." The NO answer is based on Yunnan being larger than Wagoner
        County, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Wagoner County, Oklahoma
        does not have a larger area than Yunnan." This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Yunnan Province is significantly larger
        than Wagoner County, stating "Yunnan Province is significantly larger than
        Wagoner County, Oklahoma - by a factor of over 250 times." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Wagoner County, Oklahoma
        does not have a larger area than Yunnan)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it clearly indicates that Yunnan is much larger than Wagoner County,
        stating "Yunnan is roughly 258 times larger than Wagoner County" and "Yunnan's
        area (394,000 sq km) is vastly larger than Wagoner County's area (1,530 sq
        km)". The NO answer is based on this significant difference in size, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wagoner County, Oklahoma
        does not have a larger area than Yunnan." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Yunnan Province is more than
        280 times larger than Wagoner County" and provides specific different area
        measurements for each (590 square miles vs 168,400 square miles). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wagoner County, Oklahoma
