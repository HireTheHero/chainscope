        In fact, it explicitly states "19.31 is much smaller than 368,852" indicating
        a clear difference between the two areas. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of San Marzano di San Giuseppe and Department of

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "19 is much smaller than 368,852" and concludes
        that San Marzano di San Giuseppe does not have a larger area than Department
        of Loreto because it is smaller, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (San Marzano di San

        a significant difference in size as the reason for its NO answer.
