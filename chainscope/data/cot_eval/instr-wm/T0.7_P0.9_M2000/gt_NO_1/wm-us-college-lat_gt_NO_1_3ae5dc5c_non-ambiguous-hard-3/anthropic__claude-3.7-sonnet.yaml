      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is located south of Wisconsin Lutheran College, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Huntington University,
        IN is not located north of Wisconsin Lutheran College, WI. It is located south
        of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Huntington University in Indiana is not located

        of it). The model specifically states that "Wisconsin as a whole is north
        of Indiana" and that Milwaukee (where Wisconsin Lutheran College is) is "still
        north of any city in Indiana" including Huntington.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether New Mexico State University Carlsbad is north of
        Adams State University. The model provides reasoning that Adams State University
        in Colorado must be north of New Mexico State University Carlsbad, and therefore

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kennesaw State University
        is south of Capital University, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Kennesaw State University College of Arts is north
        of Capital University. The model clearly concludes that Kennesaw State is
        south of Capital University, not north of it.
