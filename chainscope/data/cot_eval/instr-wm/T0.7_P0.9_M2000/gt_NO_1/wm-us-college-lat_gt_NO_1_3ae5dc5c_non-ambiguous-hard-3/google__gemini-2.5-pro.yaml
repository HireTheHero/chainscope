      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Huntington University is not north of Wisconsin
        Lutheran College after comparing their latitudes.

        University lies north of Wisconsin Lutheran College. The model concludes that
        "Huntington University is located south of Wisconsin Lutheran College" and
        then provides "NO" as its final answer.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        Hampshire, is north of Princeton, New Jersey." The model is indicating a difference
        in location (one is north of the other), not equality. The "NO" answer appears
        to be contradicting some unstated premise in the original question rather
        than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        model is indicating a directional difference (one is north of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly states that the locations
        are different, with Franklin Pierce University being north of the Liechtenstein
        Institute. The model specifically notes that "Rindge, NH is geographically
        north of Princeton, NJ" and "the Liechtenstein Institute is south of Franklin
        Pierce University."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "NO" after explaining that the Liechtenstein Institute
        is not north of Franklin Pierce University because Franklin Pierce University
        in Rindge, NH is further north than the Liechtenstein Institute in Princeton,
        NJ.

        is south of Rindge, New Hampshire." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating a clear negative answer to the original question of whether
        LISD is north of FPU. The model concludes that Princeton, New Jersey (where
        LISD is located) is south of Rindge, New Hampshire (where FPU is located).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the NO answer is
        because New Hampshire is north of New Jersey, meaning the geographical relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked. The model identifies a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different, with Winston-Salem State University being north of Claflin University.
        The model explains that "North Carolina is geographically north of the state
        of South Carolina" and concludes that "Claflin University is located south
        of Winston-Salem State University."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Claflin University is north of Winston-Salem State
        University. The answer is clear and direct.

        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether Claflin University
        is north of Winston-Salem State University. The model concludes that "Claflin

        Carolina, which is south of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where Winston-Salem
        State University is located. The model's NO answer is based on this geographical
        difference, not on equality.

        \ are at different latitudes (Kennesaw State at 34.0\xB0 N and Capital University\
        \ at 39.9\xB0 N) and concludes that Kennesaw State is south of Capital University,\
        \ not at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Kennesaw State University is not north of
        Capital University (it's south of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Scranton, PA is
        significantly north of Norfolk, VA" and concludes that "Old Dominion University
        is located south of the University of Scranton." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Old Dominion University lies geographically north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Scranton is north
        of Norfolk, indicating a difference in their geographical positions. The model's
        reasoning is that "Scranton, PA is geographically north of Norfolk, VA" and
        therefore Old Dominion University is not north of the University of Scranton.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Norfolk, Virginia
        is south of Scranton, Pennsylvania, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The reason for the NO answer is that ODU is south of Scranton,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Old Dominion University... located north of University
        of Scranton...?" The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Pennsylvania being north of Virginia, and therefore Scranton
        being north of Norfolk. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Old Dominion University is north of the University
        of Scranton. This is a clear, direct comparative answer.
