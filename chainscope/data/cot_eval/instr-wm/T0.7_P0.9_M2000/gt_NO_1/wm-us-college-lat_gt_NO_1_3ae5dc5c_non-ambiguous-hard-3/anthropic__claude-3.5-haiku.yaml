      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating "Huntington University (IN) is southeast
        of Wisconsin Lutheran College (WI), it is NOT north of Wisconsin Lutheran
        College." The model is indicating a directional difference (southeast vs.
        north) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Huntington University
        (IN) is actually south of Wisconsin Lutheran College (WI)" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values (latitudes)\

        \ latitudes: \"Huntington, IN is around 41.2\xB0 N latitude\" and \"Milwaukee,\
        \ WI is around 43.0\xB0 N latitude.\" The model's NO answer is based on the\
        \ fact that Wisconsin Lutheran College is at a higher latitude than Huntington\
        \ University, not that they are at the same latitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Huntington University is north of Wisconsin Lutheran College. The
        model explains that Wisconsin Lutheran College is actually north of Huntington
        University, not the other way around.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" because it determines that
        "Huntington University is south of Wisconsin Lutheran College," indicating
        a directional difference in their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two institutions.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Huntington University
        is SOUTH of Wisconsin Lutheran College, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Huntington being south,
        not north as asked in the question), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 5 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The
        model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        on equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. It directly answers the question "Is Huntington University, IN
        located north of Wisconsin Lutheran College, WI?" with "NO" after reasoning
        that Huntington University is south of Wisconsin Lutheran College.

        stating that "Indiana is south of Wisconsin" and "A location in Indiana cannot
        be north of a location in Wisconsin." The model is indicating a difference
        in geographic positions, not equality.

        that Old Dominion University is south of University of Scranton, which is
        the opposite of what was asked (if Old Dominion is north of Scranton). The
        model explicitly states "Old Dominion University is actually south of University
        of Scranton" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model determined that Old Dominion University is south of University of
        Scranton, not north as the question asked.
