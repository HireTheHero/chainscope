    11984b4b-c16d-4083-8a79-64daf2cf4abd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Huntington University is
        south of Wisconsin Lutheran College" and then says "NO". The model is not
        saying NO because the locations are at the same latitude; rather, it appears
        to be saying NO to contradict some unstated premise in the original question
        (which likely asked if Huntington University is north of Wisconsin Lutheran
        College).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4910caa5-4557-46ab-92e6-5575908b0ef7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Indiana is generally south of Wisconsin"
        which indicates a difference in latitude. The model is saying NO because Huntington
        University is south of (not north of) Wisconsin Lutheran College, not because
        they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Huntington University is *not* north of Wisconsin Lutheran
        College" which reinforces this negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73ed191d-f9a3-4481-b47f-441704b5c551:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Indiana is generally south of Wisconsin"
        and concludes that "Huntington University cannot be north of Wisconsin Lutheran
        College." The model is indicating a difference in latitude (one being south
        of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Huntington University is not north of Wisconsin
        Lutheran College.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    761ce3b8-475f-4f53-b166-baba08b64ed6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indiana is generally south
        of Wisconsin, and while there could be exceptions based on specific locations
        within the states, it concludes that Huntington University is not north of
        Wisconsin Lutheran College. The NO answer is based on relative positions (south
        vs. north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Huntington University is not north
        of Wisconsin Lutheran College.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    91da3dcb-6725-4cc7-8665-f0a89214c0b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Huntington University (in Indiana) must be south of Wisconsin Lutheran College
        (in Milwaukee, Wisconsin) based on the geographical relationship between the
        states. The model is asserting a difference in location (one is south of the
        other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    960fdb63-6046-48a0-9760-4e568e850cf9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Indiana is generally south of Wisconsin, and therefore Huntington University
        (IN) cannot be north of Wisconsin Lutheran College (WI). The model is asserting
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Indiana is generally south
        of Wisconsin," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f260db8f-036b-4296-979a-8c617e772cbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Indiana is south of Wisconsin, and therefore a location in Indiana
        cannot be north of a location in Wisconsin. The model is noting a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbaaa45d-6954-481c-9631-fd6f9c3fb641:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Huntington, Indiana is
        almost certainly south of Milwaukee, Wisconsin" which indicates a difference
        in location (one is south of the other). The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing a step-by-step analysis of the
        locations of Huntington University and Wisconsin Lutheran College.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Topeka, KS is south
        of Des Moines, IA" and "Washburn University is south of Grand View University."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a step-by-step analysis of the locations of Washburn University
        and Grand View University. The model concludes that Washburn University is
        south of Grand View University, and then gives a clear "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Topeka (where Washburn University
        is located) is "significantly south of Des Moines" (where Grand View University
        is located). This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Washburn University is north of
        Grand View University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tulsa, Oklahoma
        is generally further south than Kansas City, Missouri" which indicates a difference
        in latitude. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        that Gardner-Webb University is in North Carolina, Indiana University of Pennsylvania
        is in Pennsylvania, and that North Carolina is south of Pennsylvania. The
        model's reasoning implies a difference in location (North Carolina being south
        of Pennsylvania), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the
        same. In fact, it explicitly stated in its reasoning that "North Carolina
        is generally south of New York" and concluded that "Elizabeth City State University
        is south of Webb Institute." The model did not claim the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer. There appears to be a contradiction
        between the reasoning and the final answer, but the model definitely did not
        base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which appears to be its final answer to the comparison question. However,
        this contradicts its reasoning in step 3 where it concluded "Elizabeth City
        State University is south of Webb Institute." This inconsistency doesn't change
        the fact that the model explicitly gave "NO" as its final answer.

        is in Louisiana which is south of Arkansas (where Arkansas State University-Newport
        is located), and concludes that "University of New Orleans would therefore
        be south of Arkansas State University-Newport." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
