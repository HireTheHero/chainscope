      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Milwaukee, Wisconsin is north
        of Huntington, Indiana, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

        State University, Fresno." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that CSU San Bernardino is south of CSU Fresno (not equal positions). The
        model explicitly states a directional difference (south vs. north) between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the geographic positions of the two universities. The model
        concludes that "California State University, San Bernardino is located south
        of California State University, Fresno" and then explicitly states "NO" as
        its final answer.

        The reason for the NO answer is that San Bernardino is south of Fresno, not
        north, which means there is a clear directional difference rather than equality.

        North for Thomas More) and concludes that Southern Polytechnic is south of
        Thomas More, not north of it. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly concludes "Southern Polytechnic
        State University, GA is not located north of Thomas More University, KY; it

        The model concluded that "Southern Polytechnic State University was located

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
