      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Howard Payne is north of Cal State San Bernardino.
        The model explicitly concludes that "California State University, San Bernardino
        is located north of Howard Payne University" and then answers "NO" to the
        question asking if Howard Payne is north of Cal State San Bernardino.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wisconsin is located
        north of Missouri" and "Waukesha, WI is significantly north of St. Louis,
        MO." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference (St. Louis
        being south of Waukesha), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Concordia Seminary (St. Louis, MO) is not north of UW-Waukesha
        (Waukesha, WI). This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        University, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model explicitly states "Claflin is south of Capital" as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Claflin University is north of Capital University.
        The model explains that Capital University (in Ohio) is located north of Claflin
        University (in South Carolina), and therefore the premise of the question
        is incorrect.

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the
        locations are in different positions, with Lubbock, TX being south of Columbus,
        OH. The model concludes "Since Lubbock is south of Columbus, the statement
        is false." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        College of Engineering is not north of Ohio Dominican University, but rather
        south of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the opposite relationship is true - it explicitly states that "UNC Pembroke
        is south of Webb Institute" as the reason for its NO answer. The model identified
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that UNC Pembroke is south
        of Webb Institute (not north of it), and therefore answered "NO" to the question
        of whether UNC Pembroke is north of Webb Institute.

        north of UNC Pembroke" and "UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute." The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that UNC Pembroke

        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UNC Pembroke is north of Webb Institute. The model

        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UNC Pembroke is north of Webb Institute. The model

        The model concludes that "the location in North Carolina is south of the location
        in New York," indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        of Webb Institute). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Granite State College being north of Bloomsburg University
        (or Bloomsburg University being south of Granite State College). The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bloomsburg University is north of Granite State
        College. The model explains that Bloomsburg University is south of Granite
        State College, not north.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        (NC) is geographically north of Florida (FL)" and "Elizabeth City, NC, is
        therefore north of Tallahassee, FL." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (Tallahassee being south of Elizabeth City), not on equality of
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that Tallahassee, FL is south of
        Elizabeth City, NC, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        the Florida location is north of the North Carolina location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly concludes that
        "Tallahassee, Florida is south of Elizabeth City, North Carolina," indicating
        a difference in location. The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Tallahassee, Florida is south of Elizabeth
        City, North Carolina." Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on
        the explicit final answer provided, which is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "North Carolina
        is geographically north of Florida" and "Elizabeth City, NC is therefore north
        of Tallahassee, FL." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tallahassee being south of Elizabeth City), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive negative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tallahassee, FL
        is south of Elizabeth City, NC, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Tallahassee, FL is south of Elizabeth City, NC (not
        north as the question asked).
