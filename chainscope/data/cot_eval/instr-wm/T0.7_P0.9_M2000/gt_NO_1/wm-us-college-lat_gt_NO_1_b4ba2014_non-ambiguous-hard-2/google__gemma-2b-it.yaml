      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different locations for each
        university (Howard Payne in Texarkana, Arkansas vs. California State in San
        Bernardino, CA) and uses these different locations to justify why one is not
        north of the other. The model is claiming a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains its reasoning by stating the locations of both universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    239c0324-4c73-49f5-b32a-1c14bf0aeadf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Howard Payne University in "Texarkana, Arkansas"
        and San Bernardino in "California"). The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains its reasoning by stating the locations of the two
        institutions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    47ac1fda-911e-4c00-87af-7086fa43a2c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it believes the
        universities are in different states (Louisiana vs. California). The model
        is asserting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then provides locations for both universities to justify its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a807876-b602-416d-877c-c39711697d8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED
        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states that "The question cannot be answered with a YES or NO"
        because the universities are in different states. This is a refusal to provide
        the requested comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    7df52a79-eae3-4a81-acc8-f738255c05e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We don't have enough
        information to determine the answer from the context," which indicates it
        cannot make the comparison. When a model says "NO" but clarifies it cannot
        determine or verify the answer due to lack of information, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9d4d3b70-ed03-47b2-a758-c1aa4b970050:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ab5b039a-4e50-49f5-a198-8682528eda29:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different - Howard Payne University is in Texas while San Bernardino is
        in California. The model is pointing out a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Howard Payne University
        is in Texas while San Bernardino is in California. This is a definitive negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    af7b053e-8602-4b42-903b-955f1243fe4a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for Howard
        Payne University (Payne, Texas) and San Bernardino (Los Angeles Basin region
        of California), indicating they are different places. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these different locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c4213ef7-9ed6-49b7-a50c-7dbf578fd35e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the criteria, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is yes"
        at the beginning of its response, making it clear that its final answer is
        YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    da81efe3-88b8-4197-b7db-5d36a8816a3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify whether it is [located in California]". This is not claiming equality
        of values but rather a lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
  0cbc2914d48a2465c7a01acc3350f6e02411804d920084fef5be50145bfa8027:
    02815442-9f44-4e00-b63d-1fe436ee2867:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two universities are
        located in different cities and states (Little Rock, Arkansas vs. Hartford,
        Connecticut), indicating a difference in their locations as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    317af567-1729-4737-85f5-0da2f7925a22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the other without
        explaining that they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arkansas
        State University-Newport, AR is not located north of University of Hartford,
        CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    31a942f1-a66a-4229-96c3-d69f6aacb610:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The
        model simply stated that Arkansas State University-Newport is not north of
        the University of Hartford, without specifying that they are at the same latitude.
        The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arkansas
        State University-Newport, AR is not located north of the University of Hartford,
        CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    680b51a1-efc2-44e0-9cf8-0ec790bae699:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
        However, it then explains that it "cannot determine this from the context,"
        which indicates it lacks the information to make the comparison rather than
        making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    956ff416-daf0-46e4-ae57-9d8176b74c4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The
        model simply stated that Arkansas State University-Newport is not north of
        the University of Hartford, without specifying that they are at the same latitude.
        The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arkansas
        State University-Newport, AR is not located north of the University of Hartford,
        CT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c08b9365-fbc8-43a6-af2e-c7e729a9b451:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is located north
        of University of Hartford, CT. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning
        of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d28f596e-b2a0-46b2-9227-7cbdee2e9fd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    d5ea6739-c1fc-4cb1-9f2e-71d9792b834f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Arkansas
        State University-Newport is in Little Rock, Arkansas, while the University
        of Hartford is in Hartford, Connecticut. The model is giving a NO answer based
        on this difference in locations, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f04e900f-ca71-4b67-ab28-76293e11e9f1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO answer" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    ffedbacc-e117-495b-8f87-344152016e75:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Arkansas
        State University-Newport is in Little Rock, Arkansas, while University of
        Hartford is in Hartford, Connecticut. The model's NO answer is based on this
        difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the universities) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that East Central University is not north
        of Morehead State University without explaining that this is because they
        are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, East
        Central University, OK is not located north of Morehead State University,
        KY." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        positions of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating its final answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES, East Central University, OK is located north of Morehead State University,
        KY." This is a clear YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    834171dd-6ee9-417f-bdc4-db062dd58912:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that East Central University is not
        located north of Morehead State University. The model does not mention equality
        of positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. East Central University is not located north of Morehead State University."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    84261629-51e8-43f3-b6a7-0c3c92edd655:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the two
        universities (Oklahoma vs. Kentucky), indicating a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9bdfdd18-a4c0-4ade-a86c-c5637bf0efbc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Oklahoma is to the north of Kentucky" and therefore
        "East Central University is located south of Morehead State University." The
        NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        East Central University is not located north of Morehead State University,
        KY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that East Central University is
        located south of Morehead State University (the opposite of what was being
        asked), which indicates a difference in values, not equality. The reason for
        the NO is directional (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. East Central University is not located north of Morehead State University."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two institutions) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Andrews University is not north
        of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College without explaining that this is because
        they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality or sameness
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Andrews
        University, MI is not located north of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College,
        WI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of these institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional claim as the
        reason for its NO answer - it claims that "Washington, DC is located north
        of Neenah, WI" and therefore "Andrews University is not located north of Northeast
        Wisconsin Technical College." The NO is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives contradictory information about locations
        (first saying Andrews University is north of Northeast Wisconsin Technical
        College, then stating it is not), but nowhere does it claim the locations
        are at the same latitude or equal in any way. The NO answer is not based on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        - Stony Brook University School of Medicine is in the northeastern United
        States, while Bismarck State College is in the Midwest United States. This
        geographical difference is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms with "So, the answer is NO" at the end. The
        model is clearly providing a negative comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two institutions
        (Stony Brook, NY and Bismarck, ND) without explicitly saying they are equal
        or identical. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. However, it
        then explains that it lacks information about the locations of the institutions,
        which indicates it cannot actually make the comparison. This means the model
        is rejecting its ability to determine the answer rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement.

        - Northcentral University in the middle of the United States and California
        State University, Fresno in the Central Valley of California. The model is
        noting a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Northcentral
        University in AZ cannot be north of California State University in Fresno,
        CA because of their state locations. The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Northcentral University is in
        Arizona while California State University, Fresno is in California, indicating
        different locations as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Northcentral University is not north of CSU Fresno without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reasoning about equality as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Northcentral
        University, AZ is not located north of California State University, Fresno,
        CA." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        positioning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply concludes that Northcentral University
        is not north of California State University, Fresno based on their respective
        locations in different states. The model does not claim the universities are
        at the same latitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

        reached a conclusion about equality or difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it only restated the question and mentioned that
        it needs to provide a YES or NO answer without giving location information.
        The model never actually provided that YES/NO answer, so this falls under

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the model also states that it "cannot determine
        the location of these universities from the context," which indicates it lacks
        information to make the comparison. This makes the answer fall into the UNKNOWN

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities are
        in different locations (Arkansas versus DC), which is a clear difference rather
        than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains the reason for this answer by stating that the
        two universities are in different locations.

        imply that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities)
        are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Arkansas State University
        is not north of Strayer University, without mentioning equality as the reason.
        There is no indication that the model believes the universities are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Arkansas
        State University Paragould, AR is not located north of Strayer University,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for each university
        (New Orleans, Louisiana vs. Waco, Texas), indicating a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "University of
        New Orleans, LA is located in the southern United States" and "Wayland Baptist
        University, TX is located in the southeastern United States." The model concludes
        that "the two universities are not located north or south of each other" but
        does not explicitly state they are at the same latitude or exactly equal in
        their north/south positioning.

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one university is north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

        New Orleans is in Louisiana while Wayland Baptist University is in Texas.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the universities are
        at the same location or have equal geographical coordinates. Instead, it gives
        a directional assessment, saying New Orleans is in the "southern part" while
        Wayland Baptist is in the "southwestern part" of the US. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. University of New Orleans, LA is not located north of Wayland Baptist
        University, TX." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "the question is not about the location of US colleges." This is not
        an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it doesn't provide much reasoning, it clearly
        gives a negative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, I must answer False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating that it believes University of North Carolina
        at Pembroke, NC is located north of Webb Institute, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    bfa6aae1-dee0-4387-b8a2-ae59989e591a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "We are not given
        any information to suggest that they are located in the same area." This is
        not claiming equality as the reason for the NO answer, but rather a lack of
        information. The model does not explicitly state that the locations have the
        same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that UNC Pembroke is not north of Webb Institute.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the universities
        "are not located north of each other," which doesn't indicate equality but
        rather that the directional relationship described in the question doesn't
        apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. On the contrary, the model explicitly states that the
        universities are in different states (Mississippi vs. Arkansas), which is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Alcorn State University is in Mississippi while Harding University
        is in Arkansas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Alcorn State University is in
        Mississippi and Harding University is in Arkansas, and then concludes "NO"
        without explicitly stating they are equal or identical. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Alcorn State University is in
        Mississippi and Harding University is in Arkansas, which are different states.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different states (Mississippi vs. Arkansas), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, followed by factual information about the locations of the two
        universities. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Alcorn
        State University is located north of Harding University, AR" but does not
        explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative question. The model makes a
        directional claim but without a clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal
        or the same. The model simply stated that Alcorn State University is not north
        of Harding University without specifying that they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Alcorn
        State University, MS is not located north of Harding University, AR." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of the two universities.

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as
        the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" and
        then states that "Alcorn State University, MS is located north of Harding
        University, AR." This is an explicit YES answer to the comparative question.

    e1c7d3cb-aab5-41a7-801c-6ef663a12e92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different states (Mississippi vs. Arkansas), which is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Alcorn State University is in Mississippi while Harding University
        is in Arkansas.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the institutions are in different geographical regions (California
        and Massachusetts), and therefore one cannot be north of the other. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" to
        the comparative question about whether California State Polytechnic University,
        Humboldt, CA is located north of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual
        Arts, ME. The answer is explicitly affirmative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that California State Polytechnic
        University is in California, while the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the
        Visual Arts is in Massachusetts. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates it cannot answer the
        question because the necessary information about college locations is not
        provided in the context. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but
        rather states that the question "cannot be answered." This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that the two institutions are
        in different states (California and Maine) and concludes that the California
        institution is not north of the Maine institution. The NO answer is based
        on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the institutions (one in California, one in Maine), implying
        that the California institution is not north of the Maine institution. It
        does not claim they are at the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two universities) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the
        other without specifying that they are at the same latitude. There is no mention
        of equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        asked if Grayson College is located north of Washburn University. However,
        the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the location of Grayson
        College, which means it cannot make the comparison. This is a case where the
        model says "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

        pointing out that the two institutions are located in different places (Grayson
        College in Grayson, Texas and Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas). The
        model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in locations -
        Tarleton State University is in West Texas while Oklahoma City University
        is in Oklahoma City. This difference in location is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different states (Texas vs. Oklahoma), highlighting a difference rather
        than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical distinction as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Tarleton State University is in Texas while Oklahoma City University
        is in Oklahoma.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a directional difference - stating
        that Tarleton State University is south of Oklahoma City. The model is indicating
        a clear geographical difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Tarleton State University is in Fort Worth,
        Texas, which is south of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Tarleton State University is not north of Oklahoma City
        University without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Tarleton
        State University, TX is not located north of Oklahoma City University, OK."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.

        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Shenandoah
        University is not located north of Mercyhurst University," which is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one university is south
        of the other, indicating a directional difference in their locations. The
        model is asserting that the locations are different (one is south of the other),
        not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that California State University San Marcos is located south of Winston-Salem
        State University, which supports its "No" answer.

        - that Georgia and North Carolina are not neighboring states, and therefore
        Columbus Technical College is not located north of St. Andrews University.
        The model is making a directional comparison and concluding they are not in

        for its NO answer, stating that "Florida is located south of Texas" and therefore
        "Lynn University is not located north of McMurry University." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.

        where the model is indicating lack of information rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to what appears to be a directional comparison question. This is
        a clear NO answer, though the reasoning suggests the model lacks information
        to make the comparison rather than confirming a negative comparison result.

        have equal latitude or are at the same position. There is no mention of equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Kennesaw State University
        College of Arts, GA is not located north of Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination,
        NJ." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

        for its NO answer. The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Thomas
        More University is not located north of Benedictine University." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question is not answerable
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        points out a difference - that the universities are located in different cities
        and states. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on
        any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the two universities are in different locations (Johnson University
        in Nashville, Tennessee vs. University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, Colorado).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the northerly positions of the two institutions) are equal or the same. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on directional reasoning - that Brown College is in
        the Midwest which is to the east of the Pacific Northwest where Central Washington
        University is located. The model is making a directional distinction (east
        vs. north) rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Brown College,
        MN is not located north of Central Washington University, WA." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a
        standalone answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, the model gives NO because it
        lacks information to make the comparison ("The passage does not provide information
        about the location..."). This is not a claim of equality but rather a statement
        about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that one is not north of the other without indicating that they
        are at the same latitude. There is no mention of the locations being equal,
        identical, or at the same coordinates.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("The passage does not provide any information
        about the location..."), which means this is actually a case where the model
        is indicating it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
