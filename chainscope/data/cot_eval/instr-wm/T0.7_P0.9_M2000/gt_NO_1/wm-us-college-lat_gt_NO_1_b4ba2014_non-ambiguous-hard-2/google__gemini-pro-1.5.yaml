      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges they are in
        different states (Texas and California). The model's reasoning is that Texas
        is south of California, which leads to Howard Payne University being south
        of California State University, San Bernardino. The "NO" answer appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about whether Howard Payne University is south
        of California State University, San Bernardino.

      result: 'NO'
    33f01fcd-74b7-48fc-a109-228ee8a6ee21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Howard Payne University is
        "generally east, not north" of California State University, San Bernardino.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. north), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparison question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Howard Payne University is
        "generally east, not north" of California State University, San Bernardino.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (east vs. north), not equality
        of values.

    89f8cb7c-62cb-4ed5-ba38-0c04b422180e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Howard Payne University is east (not north)
        of California State University, San Bernardino. The model is indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Howard Payne University is not north of California
        State University, San Bernardino. The model provides a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    970c1f98-cfd1-4791-9bb8-76f96bc1fb5e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests
        that Texas is south of Southern California, implying a difference in latitude.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Howard Payne University is not north of California
        State University, San Bernardino, based on its reasoning about the relative
        positions of Texas and California.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9b68b748-33ff-40c3-9e7d-22a4078ad62d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that "Texas
        is *south* of California" which indicates a difference in position (south
        vs. north), not equality. The model is rejecting the comparison by stating
        the opposite directional relationship exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning process about the locations of Howard Payne
        University and California State University, San Bernardino. The model concludes
        that Texas is south of California, not north of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Howard Payne University is
        east of California State University, San Bernardino, and therefore cannot
        be north of it. The model is making a directional distinction (east vs. north)
        rather than claiming the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive at the end
        of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0b72b6e-5931-49bc-945f-195079b0e1e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations of the two universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        presents a logical argument about the locations of the states (Texas being
        south of California) but concludes with NO. The model does not claim the universities
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being made about whether Howard Payne University is south of California State
        University, San Bernardino.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    beabe20d-b813-4b90-8641-c2ee15ad010f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that Texas is generally east of California and concluding that Howard Payne
        University is unlikely to be north of California State University, San Bernardino.
        The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographical
        locations of Arkansas and Connecticut, concluding that Arkansas State University-Newport
        is likely south of the University of Hartford, but then contradicts this with
        a "NO" answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f80cf3c-a1d5-4d74-9c92-c30549f5c9e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests the opposite by stating "Arkansas
        is a state in the southern region" and "Connecticut is a state in the northeastern
        region" and concludes that "Southern states are generally located south of
        northeastern states." The model's reasoning actually suggests Arkansas State
        University-Newport would be south of University of Hartford, but then contradicts
        this with a "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    731463c2-4ab1-4519-a111-81623fabbd16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides reasoning that suggests Arkansas
        is south of Connecticut (saying "Southern states are generally south of northeastern
        states" and "Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is likely south of University
        of Hartford, CT"). The "NO" answer contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere
        does the model claim the locations have equal values or are at the same latitude.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7a61742c-d48c-4ae7-984a-21937de293ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Arkansas is in
        the southern region while Connecticut is in the northeastern region, and concludes
        that Arkansas State University-Newport is likely south of the University of
        Hartford, which contradicts its "NO" answer. Despite this contradiction, the
        model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      result: 'NO'
    8739be95-9df1-43ba-bfc3-d9eeb8423d8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the model's
        reasoning suggests the opposite - it states that Arkansas is in the southern
        region while Connecticut is in the northeastern region, and that "Southern
        states are generally located south of northeastern states." The model concludes
        that Arkansas State University is "likely south of" University of Hartford.
        The NO answer contradicts this reasoning but does not claim the locations
        are at the same coordinates or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response, which directly contradicts its reasoning
        that "Arkansas State University-Newport, AR is likely south of University
        of Hartford, CT." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8a142761-1c73-41db-bd41-3e01766831b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates a difference in location, stating
        that "Arkansas is a state in the southern region" while "Connecticut is a
        state in the northeastern region" and concludes that "Southern states are
        generally located south of northeastern states." The model's reasoning suggests
        Arkansas State University is south of the University of Hartford, which contradicts
        its "NO" answer. However, I'm only evaluating whether the model claimed equal
        values as the reason for its NO answer, which it did not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    94735fa3-2d65-4f48-b212-e9b55314239b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arkansas State University-Newport
        is south of the University of Hartford, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly indicating that Arkansas
        State University-Newport is not north of the University of Hartford (and instead
        is south of it).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c42e0a38-cc0b-45d4-ac63-5e964196795e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Arkansas is in
        the southern US while Connecticut is in the northeastern US, and concludes
        that Arkansas State University-Newport is likely south of the University of
        Hartford. The "NO" answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but nowhere
        does the model claim the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in
        any way.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that Arkansas State University-Newport
        is likely south of the University of Hartford, which indicates a difference
        in location. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided,
        but there's no indication that the model is saying NO because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about the geographical
        locations of Arkansas and Connecticut, concluding that Arkansas State University-Newport
        is likely south of the University of Hartford, which contradicts its "NO"
        answer. Despite this contradiction, the model does not claim equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    01795089-c769-4fad-b66c-8edacc490576:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that
        Oklahoma is south of Kentucky, meaning East Central University is likely south
        of Morehead State University. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result after
        its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that East Central University
        (in Ada, Oklahoma) is not north of Morehead State University (in Morehead,
        Kentucky) because Oklahoma is generally south of Kentucky. The model is noting
        a directional difference (Oklahoma being further south than Kentucky), not
        equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ada, OK is "highly unlikely"
        to be north of Morehead, KY, indicating a directional difference (with Ada
        being south of Morehead). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear negative response after its
        step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ada, Oklahoma (East
        Central University) is south of Morehead, Kentucky (Morehead State University)"
        which indicates a difference in location. The NO answer appears to be in direct
        response to the original question (which likely asked if East Central University
        is north of Morehead State University).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Morehead State University is further north than East
        Central University. The model provides a direct comparison and concludes with
        an explicit "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "Oklahoma is further south than Kentucky. Therefore, ECU is south
        of MSU." The NO answer appears to be in response to some unstated question
        about whether ECU is north of MSU (or similar), and the model is rejecting
        this based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through its reasoning about the locations of East Central University
        and Morehead State University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Lubbock, TX is south of
        St. Davids, PA" and then gives a "NO" answer. The model is not saying NO because
        the locations are at the same latitude; rather, it appears to be saying NO
        to contradict its own reasoning (which is inconsistent, but we're not evaluating
        correctness). Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        share "similar latitudes" but specifically notes that New York is "further
        east" than North Dakota. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that being
        "further east does not make it further north," implying the comparison is
        about northerly position. Since the model notes similarity but not equality,
        and provides a directional reason rather than equality as the basis for its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New York is generally east
        of North Dakota, and since latitude determines north/south location, Stony
        Brook is likely not north of Bismarck State College. The model is indicating
        a difference in position (with Bismarck likely being further north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical sequence showing that
        Claflin University is south of Capital University (since Claflin is in South
        Carolina, Capital is in Ohio, and South Carolina is south of Ohio). The model
        then contradicts its own reasoning by answering "NO" without explaining why.
        Since the model does not claim the locations are equal or the same, and equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.

        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it did not justify this
        with a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which appears to be its final answer to the comparison question. However,
        this contradicts its reasoning in step 3 where it concluded "UNC Pembroke
        is south of Webb Institute." This inconsistency suggests the model may have
        made an error in its final answer, but I must evaluate based on what was explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Georgia is significantly
        south of Colorado" and concludes that GMC cannot be north of WCU because of
        this directional difference. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        US and Colorado is in the western US, and then makes a claim about eastern
        US states generally being south of western US states. The model concludes
        "NO" but does not indicate this is because the locations have equal values
        or positions. The reasoning appears to contradict the conclusion, but I'm
        only evaluating what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, concluding
        that "Tallahassee, FL is south of Elizabeth City, NC" as the reason for its
        NO answer. The model is indicating a clear directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Florida A&M University-Florida
        State University College of Engineering is NOT north of Elizabeth City State
        University. This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cbf8f7c0-70ff-4f22-bd51-adaeb1edd135:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida is south
        of North Carolina, and that Tallahassee (where Florida A&M University-Florida
        State University College of Engineering is located) is south of Elizabeth
        City, North Carolina (where Elizabeth City State University is located). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question about whether Florida A&M University-Florida State University
        College of Engineering is north of Elizabeth City State University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3fda8f5-0858-4455-8ea7-b37d30d06762:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Tallahassee (where Florida\
        \ A&M is located) is at 30.44\xB0 N while Elizabeth City (where Elizabeth\
        \ City State University is located) is at 36.29\xB0 N. The model states \"\
        Since 30.44\xB0 N is less than 36.29\xB0 N, Tallahassee is south of Elizabeth\
        \ City\" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are different, not equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the original
        question, which appears to have asked if Florida A&M University is north of
        Elizabeth City State University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d4936d6b-94a7-4234-bab9-0adb2360e788:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Tallahassee, FL is south
        of Elizabeth City, NC, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Tallahassee, FL is south of Elizabeth City, NC." This
        is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d8375012-01db-47ac-8303-c3142ff88dea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Tallahassee, FL is south
        of Elizabeth City, NC" and then answers "NO". The model is indicating a difference
        in position (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing a step-by-step analysis of the
        locations of the two universities.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffda408b-0bb5-4cee-a47f-2a46a22ba9bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on its reasoning that
        Florida is south of North Carolina, and therefore a university in Florida
        must be south of a university in North Carolina. The model is making a directional
        comparison (south vs. north) rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning process. The answer is clearly stated at
        the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
