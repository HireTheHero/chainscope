      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Claflin University is south
        of Capital University, indicating a directional difference. The model states
        "South Carolina is geographically south of Ohio" and concludes that "Claflin
        University (in SC) would be south of Capital University (in OH), not north
        of it." This shows the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        is north of Claflin University" which is why Claflin is NOT north of Capital.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Claflin University is

        University-Armstrong Campus is NOT located north of Furman University. It
        is located south of it." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        A&M University - Florida State University College of Engineering is located
        north of Elizabeth City State University. The model determined that Elizabeth
        City State University is further north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different\
        \ latitudes (Tallahassee at 30.4\xB0 N and Elizabeth City at 36.3\xB0 N) and\
        \ concludes that Elizabeth City is further north than Tallahassee. The NO\
        \ answer is based on this difference in latitude, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Florida A&M University - Florida State University
        College of Engineering is not located north of Elizabeth City State University.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Elizabeth City,
        NC is further north than Tallahassee, FL" and "North Carolina is generally
        north of Florida on a map." The model is indicating a difference in latitude,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" at the end of its\
        \ response, and also states \"Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State\
        \ University College of Engineering is NOT located north of Elizabeth City\
        \ State University.\" This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values (latitudes)\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude, stating\
        \ \"Elizabeth City, NC has a latitude of approximately 36.3\xB0 N, while Tallahassee,\
        \ FL has a latitude of approximately 30.4\xB0 N\" and concludes that \"Elizabeth\
        \ City State University (NC) is located north of Florida A&M University -\
        \ Florida State University College of Engineering (FL).\" The NO answer is\
        \ because the second location is north of the first, not because they are\
        \ equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This appears to be a direct answer to the comparative question,
        indicating that the first location is not further north than the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations with Elizabeth City State University being north
        of Florida A&M University. The model explains that "North Carolina's entire
        state is north of Florida's northern border" and that Elizabeth City "lies
        significantly north of Tallahassee, Florida." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Florida A&M University - Florida
        State University College of Engineering is NOT north of Elizabeth City State
        University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida A&M-FSU
        College of Engineering is south of Elizabeth City State University, indicating
        a clear difference in their geographic positions. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Florida A&M-FSU College
        of Engineering is NOT north of Elizabeth City State University; it is south
        of it)" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\

        \ State University is at a higher latitude (36.3\xB0 N) than FAMU-FSU College\
        \ of Engineering (30.4\xB0 N), indicating they have different latitudes. The\
        \ NO answer is given because the Florida institution is south of the North\
        \ Carolina institution, not because they are at the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "the Florida institution
        is NOT north of the North Carolina institution" and ends with a clear "NO"
        as its final determination.
