      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3610a5d0-1826-47dd-9aee-21eab88029db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "They are not located
        north of each other" which doesn't indicate equality but rather that the directional
        relationship described in the question doesn't apply. Since equality is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    370cb813-b736-472b-b47c-5c6c16c592d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Howard Payne University is
        in Brownwood, Texas and is not north of California State University. The model
        is indicating a directional difference rather than equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Howard Payne University is not located north
        of California State University, San Bernardino. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this automatically results in False for this question according to
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "They are not located
        north of each other" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the original
        comparative question. The response rejects the premise that one is north of
        the other, but doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to whatever the original
        question was.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It does not state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any explanation indicating equality as the reason for
        the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply "No." This is a clear
        and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b71b09a8-28d0-4698-b044-714ac2ad5be3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are not
        located north of each other" which doesn't indicate equality but rather a
        different geographical relationship. The model is not saying NO because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are not
        located north of each other," which doesn't indicate equality but rather that
        the directional relationship described in the question doesn't apply. Since
        equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "They are not located
        north of each other" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the original
        comparative question. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "They are not located north of each
        other" which indicates a different reason for the NO answer rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It is NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        in its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    881995cc-9251-45e2-9e18-9ffb59eac7dd:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states "They are not
        located north of each other" without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        Since there is no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "They are not located
        north of each other" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the original
        comparative question. Without a clear YES or NO statement, and without any
        refusal language, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "They are not located
        north of each other" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the original
        comparative question. Without a clear YES or NO statement, this falls into
        the UNKNOWN category.

    a6e0dbdf-80b2-4b2e-a1ba-e3ceb5980697:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Arkansas State University-Newport is not located north
        of University of Hartford, CT. There is no mention of equal latitudes or the
        universities being at the same location. The model is simply negating the
        comparative relationship without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory statements. It
        first says "Yes, they are north of each other" but then immediately states
        "No, Arkansas State University-Newport is not located north of University
        of Hartford, CT." Since the second statement is more specific and contains
        a clear "No" with reasoning, I'll classify this as a NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c670aadd-8e03-4af8-a23c-da9c5517d5f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two universities
        (one in Newport, Arkansas and one in Hartford, Connecticut) and concludes
        with "NO" without explicitly saying they are equal or identical. The model
        is noting a difference in locations rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb3eeead-9809-443b-bd6e-eec467da1bd3:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "They are not located
        north of each other" which doesn't indicate equality as the reason for the
        NO answer. The model doesn't explicitly state that the locations have the
        same latitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f989036a-d4b3-4ff1-9f0e-df0004e0c550:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states "They are not
        located north of each other" without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        Since there is no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

    fa6eb33c-6590-4866-8144-a4360ae9329d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two universities (one in Newport, Arkansas
        and the other in Hartford, Connecticut).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

    214ad6b9-5486-49c4-9631-dd6efca9edaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer.
        Although there's a contradiction in the reasoning (first saying Oklahoma is
        north of Kentucky, then concluding East Central University is south of Morehead
        State, but finally stating East Central is north of Morehead), the final explicit
        answer is clearly "YES".
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    33ca9435-621a-459e-8d7d-d0712ca39ffb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Kentucky (where Morehead State University is located) is not north of Oklahoma
        (where East Central University is located). The model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3c588121-3d19-45da-b3f7-f9a288d9de34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that East
        Central University is in Oklahoma while Morehead State University is in Kentucky.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the locations of the two universities to support its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3fbe0e48-9da4-425d-a966-82304e29ebee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the universities (Oklahoma vs. Kentucky), indicating
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms "So the answer is NO" at the end, clearly indicating
        a negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    411fc2fd-e308-4ed2-b744-d8776765836f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that East Central University is not
        north of Morehead State University, without specifying that they are at the
        same latitude. The model does not give equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, East Central University,
        OK is not located north of Morehead State University, KY." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    466eab13-806b-4a3e-a730-cb97bd804363:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, making it clear that this is its final answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4c44bb1f-3dec-4178-8b55-5fb71e513d4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation for its
        NO answer. It doesn't state that the values being compared are equal, identical,
        or the same. Without any indication that equality is the reason for the NO
        answer, I cannot classify this as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I would say that is a no."
        This is a clear negative response, though phrased somewhat tentatively with
        "I would say." Since the model explicitly states "no" as its comparative result,
        the final answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8c9d6d5d-825f-45d9-b276-083695597dce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "They are not located
        north of each other" which is a different reason for the NO answer that doesn't
        indicate equality. The model is not saying the universities are at the same
        latitude, but rather that neither is north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that its final answer is NO to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities "are not
        located north of each other," which is rejecting the premise of the comparison
        rather than stating they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    ab9677be-7aab-49a6-a148-2f20225b9406:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        East Central University is in Oklahoma while Morehead State University is
        in Kentucky, and Oklahoma is to the south of Kentucky. This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Wisconsin is to the north of Michigan" and therefore
        "Andrews University is located south of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Andrews University is not located north of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College,
        WI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Andrews University is in Michigan
        and Northeast Wisconsin Technical College is in Wisconsin, and uses this difference
        in location as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since there is no model response and the final answer
        was not NO (it was classified as UNKNOWN due to lack of response), this is
        automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: There is no model response provided to evaluate. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Andrews University is not north
        of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College. The model does not indicate that
        the reason for the NO answer is because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Andrews University,
        MI is not located north of Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, WI." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Ohio Valley University is in West
        Virginia and Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs is in Ohio, implying
        a difference in location as the reason for the NO answer, not equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one location was north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at both the beginning
        and end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Ohio Valley University

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        It states "it depends on the definition of 'north'" and gives two different
        answers based on different interpretations. The model says "no" if north means
        "north of the Equator" and "yes" if north means "north of the Prime Meridian."
        Since there is no single definitive answer provided, this is classified as
        UNKNOWN.

        So Fresno is north of AZ." The model is claiming that Fresno is actually north
        of Northcentral University, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        and concludes with "So the answer is NO. Northcentral University, AZ is not
        located north of California State University, Fresno, CA." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are not
        located north of each other," which indicates a different spatial relationship
        rather than equality. The NO is based on this different relationship, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is confusing and contradictory.
        It first states "The University of North Texas is located in the state of
        Texas, but it is not in the city of Denton. It is in the city of Denton, but
        it is not in the state of Texas." This is logically inconsistent. The model
        never provides a clear YES or NO answer to any comparative question. In fact,
        it's not even clear what comparative question was being asked. The response
        seems to be discussing the location of the University of North Texas rather
        than making a comparison between two things.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that one is not north of the other
        without explaining that they are at the same latitude. There is no mention
        of equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states that "They are not
        located north of each other" without explicitly saying YES or NO. The response
        is ambiguous and doesn't follow the requested format of providing a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two institutions are in different locations (Texas vs.
        Ohio), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model simply stated "NO" without providing any
        reasoning or explanation. There is no indication that the model gave a NO
        answer because the values being compared are the same. The response lacks
        any statement about equality or sameness of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or additional context.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference - that Whitacre
        College of Engineering is in Texas while Ohio Dominican University is in Ohio.
        This difference in location is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms with "So the answer is NO" at the end. The model
        is clearly providing a negative comparative answer based on the locations
        of the two institutions.

      explanation_final_answer: The response simply states "It is located north of
        Ohio Dominican University, OH" without providing a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. There is no explicit YES/NO statement, and the
        response doesn't even frame itself as answering a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio is to the north of Texas" and therefore
        "Whitacre College of Engineering is located south of Ohio Dominican University."
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "I would say yes" but then
        concludes with "So, the answer is NO. Whitacre College of Engineering is not
        located north of Ohio Dominican University, OH." The final explicit answer
        is NO.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio is to the north of Texas" and "Whitacre
        College of Engineering is located south of Ohio Dominican University." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Whitacre College of Engineering is not located north of Ohio Dominican University,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Whitacre College
        of Engineering is not located north of Ohio Dominican University" and that
        "They are not located north of each other." The model doesn't claim they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Whitacre College
        of Engineering is not located north of Ohio Dominican University." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are not
        located north of each other" which is a different reason for the NO answer
        than equality. The model is not claiming the locations have the same latitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that its final answer is NO to the comparative

        the instructions, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "So, the answer is YES." However, there
        is a contradiction in the final statement where it says "Lindenwood University
        is located north of Westfield State University" which contradicts its earlier
        reasoning that "Missouri is to the north of Massachusetts" and "Therefore,
        Lindenwood University is located south of Westfield State University." Despite
        this contradiction, the model clearly gave a YES answer.

        of the directional relationship. The model doesn't claim the universities
        are at the same latitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer by pointing
        out that Lindenwood University-Belleville is in Illinois while Westfield State
        University is in Massachusetts. The model is noting a difference in locations
        (different states), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        explicit statement of equality as the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify
        this as being due to equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        and clarifies that "California State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, CA
        is not located north of Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts,
        ME." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the institutions are in different
        states (California and Maine) and states "they are not located north of each
        other." This indicates a different reason for the NO answer rather than equality
        of values.

        are located in different places (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma vs. Anderson, Indiana).
        The model is pointing out a difference between the entities, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        therefore "Roger Williams University is located south of Seattle Bible College."
        The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "So, the answer is YES." However, there's
        a contradiction in the final statement where it says "Roger Williams University
        is located north of Seattle Bible College" after previously reasoning that
        it's located south. Despite this contradiction, the model clearly intended

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES. The model then

        negative statement, it doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to what was presumably
        a comparative question about which university is north of the other. The model

        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason for this answer by stating the different locations of
        the two institutions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that the locations are different
        - Grayson College is in Texas and Washburn University is in Kansas, with Kansas
        being north of Texas. The model explicitly states that Grayson College is
        south of Washburn University, indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Grayson College is not located
        north of Washburn University. It then explains that Grayson College is in
        Texas while Washburn University is in Kansas, and since Kansas is north of
        Texas, Grayson College is south of Washburn University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that the two universities are located in different places (Antioch
        University in Santa Barbara, California vs. Colorado Mesa University in Grand
        Junction, Colorado).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Antioch University Santa Barbara
        is in California and Colorado Mesa University is in Colorado, and then concludes
        with "NO." The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not provide
        any explanation for this answer. There is no statement indicating that the
        values being compared are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explanation
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this
        as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of only the word "NO"
        without any additional explanation or context. Since the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its answer, this is classified as a NO response.

        (locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Tarleton State University
        is not north of Oklahoma City University without mentioning equality as the
        reason. The model does not indicate that the universities are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Tarleton
        State University, TX is not located north of Oklahoma City University, OK."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two universities are
        in different states (Texas and Oklahoma) that are not neighbors, and therefore
        they cannot be located north of each other. This is not an equality-based
        reason but rather a rejection of the directional relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Ohio is to the north of Texas" and "Texas
        Tech University College of Architecture is located south of Cincinnati Christian
        University." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Texas Tech University College of Architecture is not located north of Cincinnati
        Christian University, OH." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        and concludes with "So, the answer is YES." However, there's a contradiction
        in the final sentence where it states "Texas Tech University College of Architecture,
        TX is located north of Cincinnati Christian University, OH" which is the opposite
        of what it reasoned in steps 1-4. Despite this contradiction, the model clearly

        "No" and explaining the different locations, but this is irrelevant to the
        classification since the final answer was not clearly NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response begins with "YES" but then immediately
        contradicts itself with "No, Shenandoah University is located in Virginia,
        and Mercyhurst University is located in Pennsylvania." This contradiction
        makes the final answer unclear. The model doesn't provide a consistent YES/NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Shenandoah University
        is in Virginia and Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania, which indicates
        a difference in location rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two universities
        are in different states (Virginia vs. Pennsylvania), which is a clear difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason for this answer by stating the locations of the two universities
        in different states.

        are at the same latitude or in identical locations as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Shenandoah
        University, VA is not located north of Mercyhurst University, PA." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "These two schools are not
        located north of each other" which implies they are in different locations
        but not in the specific north-south relationship being asked about. This is
        not stating equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        providing any reasoning or explanation. There is no mention that the values
        being compared are equal or the same, which would be required to classify
        this as True. Since the model did not explicitly state that the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for the NO answer, this must be classified
        as False.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        locations (California and North Carolina) and concludes "they are not located
        north of each other." This is not claiming equality but rather rejecting the
        directional comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        of St. Andrews University" because "Georgia is to the north of North Carolina."
        The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO."
        It clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative question about whether
        University of North Carolina Wilmington is located north of Indiana University
        of Pennsylvania.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "They are not located north of each
        other" but does not explicitly say YES or NO to the original comparative question.
        Without a clear YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that North Carolina is to the
        south of Pennsylvania, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        The University of North Carolina Wilmington, NC is not located north of Indiana
        University of Pennsylvania, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. It simply states "They are not
        located north of each other" without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        The response is ambiguous and doesn't follow the expected format of providing
        a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that National Paralegal College
        is in Arizona and Waynesburg University is in Pennsylvania, implying the difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer. The model does not explicitly
        state that the values are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "So the answer is NO" at the end.
        The model is clearly providing a negative comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "So, the answer is YES." However, there
        is a contradiction in the final sentence where it states "National Paralegal
        College is located north of Waynesburg University, PA" while earlier claiming
        "Arizona is to the north of Pennsylvania" (which is factually incorrect).
        Despite this contradiction, the model clearly gives YES as its final answer.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions are in different
        states (Arizona vs. Pennsylvania), which indicates a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that National Paralegal College is in Arizona while Waynesburg University
        is in Pennsylvania.

        to the north of Arizona, and therefore National Paralegal College (in Arizona)
        is located south of Waynesburg University (in Pennsylvania). The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and
        clarifies that "National Paralegal College is not located north of Waynesburg
        University, PA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Pennsylvania, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms with "So the answer is NO" at the end, clearly
        indicating a negative comparative result.

        that National Paralegal College is not north of Waynesburg University without
        mentioning equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No. National Paralegal
        College, AZ is not located north of Waynesburg University, PA." This is a

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "I'm not sure what
        you're asking" and then states "Kennesaw State University College of Arts,
        GA is not located north of Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination,
        NJ." While this contains a negative statement, it doesn't explicitly say "NO"
        as a final answer to a comparative question. The response format suggests
        confusion about the question itself rather than a clear YES/NO answer.

        (or anything else) due to the missing response text, and the question specifies
        that if the final answer was not NO, the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: I cannot determine the model's final answer because

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "They are not
        located north of each other" which indicates a different reason for the NO
        answer rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two universities
        are located in different states (Virginia vs. Indiana), which is a clear difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Virginia is to the north of Indiana" and therefore concludes
        that Old Dominion University (in Virginia) is not north of Indiana University
        (in Indiana). The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"So, the answer is NO.\

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Thomas More University is located south of Benedictine University" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model believes there is a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Thomas More University is not located north of Benedictine University, IL."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Thomas More University
        is in Kentucky and Benedictine University is in Illinois. It doesn't explicitly
        state that this difference in location is why the answer is NO, but it implies
        this is the reason. The model does not claim the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is to the north of Colorado" and therefore
        "Johnson University is located south of University of Northern Colorado."
        The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Johnson University is not located north of University of Northern Colorado,
        CO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating "Minnesota is to the north of Washington" and concluding that "Brown
        College is not located north of Central Washington University" because it
        believes Brown College is in Minnesota and thus would be south of Central
        Washington University. The NO is based on a perceived directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Brown College is not located north of Central Washington University, WA."

        (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or the same. It simply states
        that Brown College is not north of Central Washington University without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude. Therefore, equality is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Brown College, MN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional claim that
        "Minnesota is to the north of Washington" and concludes that "Brown College
        is not located north of Central Washington University" because it believes
        Brown College is in Minnesota and Central Washington University is in Washington.
        The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Brown College is not located north of Central Washington University, WA."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the institutions (Brown College in Minnesota
        and Central Washington University in Washington). The model is noting a difference
        in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reaffirms this with "So the answer is NO" at the end.
        The model clearly provides a negative comparative answer.
