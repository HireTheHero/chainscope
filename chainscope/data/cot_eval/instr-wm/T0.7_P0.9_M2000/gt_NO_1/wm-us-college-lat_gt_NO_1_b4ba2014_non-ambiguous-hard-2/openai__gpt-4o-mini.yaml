      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, stating
        "Brownwood, Texas is generally east of San Bernardino, California, it is also
        south of it." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Howard Payne University in Texas is located north
        of California State University, San Bernardino.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)

        - it states that "Brownwood is east of San Bernardino, it cannot be north
        of it." The model is making a directional comparison (east vs. north) rather
        than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
