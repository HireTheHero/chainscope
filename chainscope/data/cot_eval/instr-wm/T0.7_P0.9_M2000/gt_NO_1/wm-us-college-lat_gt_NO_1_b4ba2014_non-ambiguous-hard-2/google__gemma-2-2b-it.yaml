      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Arkansas is in the South while Connecticut
        is in the Northeast, implying they are in different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No. Arkansas is in the
        South and Connecticut is in the Northeast. Newport, Arkansas is not north
        of Hartford, Connecticut." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        this question does not apply. The model did not make any claim about the values
        being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states "I need a map to answer this
        question," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional
        information. This is effectively refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the
        question (find locations, determine relative positions, compare) but did not
        actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model ended by offering

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine
        the relative positions. The model does not claim the locations are at the
        same latitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO answer appears to be
        based on inability to determine, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it previously stated "we cannot determine if Ohio Valley University
        is located north of Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs." This appears
        to be a clear NO answer, though there's some inconsistency with the reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by the
        criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it doesn't have access to the geographic information
        needed to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Ohio is located north of West
        Virginia" which indicates a difference in location. The model is not saying
        NO because the values are equal, but rather because of some other reasoning
        related to their relative positions.

        Valley University is in West Virginia while Maxine Goodman Levin College of
        Urban Affairs is in Ohio, and that "Ohio is to the north of West Virginia."
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about both colleges
        being in Ohio and then makes a statement about Ohio being north of West Virginia,
        but doesn't explicitly state that the colleges are at the same location or
        have equal values on any dimension. The reasoning for the NO answer appears
        to be based on other factors, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "West Virginia is located to
        the south of Ohio" which indicates a difference in location (one is south
        of the other), not equality. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer.

        Valley University is in West Virginia while Maxine Goodman Levin College of
        Urban Affairs is in Ohio. This difference in location is the reason for the
        NO answer.

        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The model
        did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but

        the answer without actually providing one.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes differences in location, stating
        that "North Dakota is located in the northern part of the US, while New York
        is located in the eastern part of the US" and that they are "in different
        states." The NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute," indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct, with the model
        concluding that "UNC Pembroke is south of Webb Institute" and therefore answering
        "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether UNC Pembroke is north
        of Webb Institute.

        the locations are equal or identical. Without an explicit statement about
        equality being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as True.

        the locations (Jackson, Mississippi and McKenzie, Tennessee) but does not
        explicitly state they are at the same latitude or equally north. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It identifies the locations of both universities
        but does not make a definitive statement about their relative positions. Instead,
        it suggests that "you'll need to do the step-by-step reasoning to determine
        the answer" and that "you'll need to use a map service or tool to find the
        exact locations and their relative positions." This indicates the model is

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer
        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (identify locations, find locations, compare locations) but did not
        actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model ended by offering

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to reason through
        the question (find locations, use a map service, analyze the map) but did
        not execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with "Let

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer, but did not actually state a conclusion about whether Tarleton State
        University is north of Oklahoma City University. The model ended by offering

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        about the specific locations of the universities before it can determine their
        relative positions. The model is essentially saying it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tarleton State University
        is not located north of Oklahoma City University" because they are in "geographically
        separate states." The model is making a directional comparison and concluding
        with a negative, not stating that the locations have equal values.

        is located in Texas and Cincinnati Christian University is in Ohio. Therefore,
        they are not located in the same geographical region and thus not in the same
        state." The NO answer is based on the universities being in different states/regions,

        explaining that Lubbock, Texas is in the southern United States while Cincinnati,
        Ohio is in the Midwestern United States, implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality.

        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it concludes with "I need to see a map
        to determine this," indicating it cannot make the determination without additional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about the distance between the two locations. The
        NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison rather
        than equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question with a YES or NO" because it doesn't have access to geographical
        data. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Shenandoah University is in Virginia
        and Mercyhurst University is in Pennsylvania, and then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating that the locations are equal or identical. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is on the western side of the continent. Therefore, they are on different
        sides of the continent and are not located in the same general region." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it misinterpreted
        the question and concluded that since the universities are in different states
        (Texas and Arkansas), "they are not located in the same region." The model
        is not claiming the locations are equal or identical - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" as stated in the
        conclusion: "The question asks if they are located north or south of each
        other. Since Texas and Arkansas are in different states, they are not located
        in the same region, therefore the answer is NO". However, this is a misinterpretation
        of the original comparative question, which was likely asking which university
        is north/south of the other. The model didn''t properly address the comparative

        - it claims that the Liechtenstein Institute on Self-Determination is "likely
        fictional" while Kennesaw State University is real, and concludes that since
        one entity is supposedly fictional, the comparison cannot be made. This is
        not a claim of equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Florida A&M University - Florida State University
        College of Engineering is not north of Elizabeth City State University. This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Both Florida and North Carolina
        are in the southeastern US" but they are "separated by a significant distance
        and geographical boundaries." The model is giving a NO answer based on geographical
        reasoning, not because the locations are equal or identical.
