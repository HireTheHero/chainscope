        degrees North latitude while Morehead, KY is at approximately 38.18 degrees
        North latitude. The model states that "Since 34.73 is less than 38.18, Ada,
        OK (and thus ECU) is south of Morehead, KY (and thus MSU)." The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether ECU is north of MSU. The model provides a step-by-step
        analysis comparing the latitudes of the two universities and concludes that
        ECU is not north of MSU.

        have different latitudes (34.76 degrees North for Ada, Oklahoma vs. 38.19
        degrees North for Morehead, Kentucky) and concluded that "Morehead, Kentucky
        is located north of Ada, Oklahoma. Therefore, East Central University (Ada,
        OK) is located south of Morehead State University (Morehead, KY)." The NO
        answer appears to be in response to a question about whether East Central
        University is north of Morehead State University.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Claflin University
        in South Carolina is located south of Capital University in Ohio, indicating
        a difference in location. The "NO" answer appears to be in response to the
        original comparative question, not because the locations are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Orangeburg, SC is
        south of Columbus, OH, indicating a difference in latitude. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Claflin University (in SC) is south of Capital University
        (in OH), not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in latitude
        (33.5 degrees North for Claflin vs. 40 degrees North for Capital) and concludes
        that Capital University is north of Claflin University. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Claflin University, SC located north of Capital University,
        OH?" The model explains its reasoning by determining that Capital University
        is north of Claflin University, and therefore Claflin University is south
        of Capital University.

        model explicitly says "it's the other way around" indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the question of whether Claflin University (SC) is
        located north of Capital University (OH). The model explains that "it's the

        that "Claflin University, SC is located south of Capital University, OH" and
        then says "NO". This suggests the model is saying NO to a question about whether
        Claflin University is north of Capital University (though the original question
        isn't provided). The NO is based on a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not on equality of values.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "**YES / NO
        Answer:**" without providing an explicit final answer. While the model's reasoning
        clearly indicates that Belleville, IL is south of Westfield, MA (and thus
        the answer should be NO), it never explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        have different latitudes (Tallahassee at 30.4 degrees North and Elizabeth
        City at 36.3 degrees North) and concluded that Tallahassee is south of Elizabeth
        City, not north as the question asked. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Florida A&M University
        - Florida State University College of Engineering (in Tallahassee, FL) is
        NOT located north of Elizabeth City State University (in Elizabeth City, NC).
        Instead, it concluded that Tallahassee is south of Elizabeth City based on
        latitude comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6fd0781b-2bc2-44db-9961-a3daa04deb6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida is south
        of North Carolina" and "Tallahassee is south of Elizabeth City." The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs.
        north), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This directly answers the comparative question
        that was asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with the Florida location being south of the North Carolina location.
        The reason for the NO answer is that "Florida is south of North Carolina.
        Therefore, a location in Florida cannot be north of a location in North Carolina."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 9 and reiterates it in the "Answer: NO" at the end. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.'

    7868ef1e-2009-4df1-a6aa-378837dc70ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tallahassee is
        south of Elizabeth City" and that "the Florida university is not located north
        of the North Carolina university." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Elizabeth City is at a higher
        latitude than Tallahassee, meaning they are at different latitudes. The model
        concludes that Tallahassee is located south of Elizabeth City, not that they
        are at the same latitude. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer.\
        \ The model clearly concludes that the statement \"Florida A&M University\
        \ \u2013 Florida State University College of Engineering, FL located north\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Elizabeth City, NC is at 36.3
        degrees North latitude while Tallahassee, FL is at 30.4 degrees North latitude,
        and concludes that Florida A&M is south of Elizabeth City State University.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ to the question \"Is Florida A&M University \u2013 Florida State University\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Florida college is south of the North Carolina college (not north
        as the question presumably asked). The model explicitly states "Elizabeth
        City, NC is significantly further north than Tallahassee, FL" and "the College
        of Engineering in Tallahassee is located south of Elizabeth City State University,"
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Florida college
        is south of the North Carolina college, not north of it, and explicitly concluded
        with "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tallahassee, Florida
        is located further south than Elizabeth City, North Carolina" and concludes
        that the College of Engineering is "not north of Elizabeth City State University."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the FAMU-FSU College
        of Engineering is south of Elizabeth City State University, indicating a clear
        directional difference between their locations. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the locations have different geographical positions (one is south
        of the other), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning and in the final formatted answer at the bottom of the
        response. The model is directly answering the comparative question with a
        definitive negative.
