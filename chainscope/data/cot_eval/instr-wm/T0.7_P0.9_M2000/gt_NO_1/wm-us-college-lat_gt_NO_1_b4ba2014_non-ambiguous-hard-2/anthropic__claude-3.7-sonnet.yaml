        Pembroke is south of Webb Institute, not north of it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "UNC Pembroke
        is located south of Webb Institute, not north of it" and ends with "NO" as
        a direct answer.
