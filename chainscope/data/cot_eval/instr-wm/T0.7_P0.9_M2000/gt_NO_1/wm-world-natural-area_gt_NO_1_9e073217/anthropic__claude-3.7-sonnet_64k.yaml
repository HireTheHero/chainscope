      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Lake Hallwil has 10.3 sq km while Lake Ossiach
        has 10.8 sq km, and it states "10.3 sq km (Lake Hallwil) < 10.8 sq km (Lake
        Ossiach)" showing they are different values. The NO answer is based on Lake
        Hallwil being smaller than Lake Ossiach, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lake Hallwil does not
        have a larger area than Lake Ossiach" as its final answer. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Lake Michigan
        (58,000 sq km) has a larger area than Ungava Bay (50,000 sq km). The model
        notes a clear difference between the two values, with Lake Michigan being
        larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the areas of Ungava Bay and Lake Michigan. The model concludes
        that Lake Michigan has a larger area than Ungava Bay, and therefore Ungava
        Bay does not have a larger area than Lake Michigan.

        Instead, it explicitly calculates that Lake Afton (104.4 hectares) is slightly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the areas of Larnaca Salt Lake (15.85 square kilometers)

        Lake (8.5 sq km) is larger than Larnaca Salt Lake (2.2-6 sq km), not because
        the values are the same. The model explicitly notes a difference in size between
        the two lakes, stating that "Even at its maximum seasonal extent, Larnaca
        Salt Lake (6 sq km) is smaller than Bridge Lake (8.5 sq km)."

        at its maximum seasonal extent, Larnaca Salt Lake (6 sq km) is smaller than
        Bridge Lake (8.5 sq km)." This is a definitive comparative answer.

        kilometers." The model gives a NO answer because it found Bridge Lake to be
        larger, not because the lakes have equal areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Larnaca Salt Lake does
        not have a larger area than Bridge Lake" as its final answer. This is an explicit

        stated that Lake Phalen is larger (198 acres) than Lake Windigo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "NO - Based on my analysis,
        Lake Phalen has a larger area than Lake Windigo." This is confusing because
        the "NO" contradicts the explanation that follows it. The model seems to have
        made an error in its final answer formulation, as throughout its reasoning
        it concluded that Lake Phalen is larger than Lake Windigo (which would be
        a "YES" answer to "Does Lake Phalen have a larger area than Lake Windigo?").
        Due to this contradiction between the "NO" and the explanation that follows,
        the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

        have a larger area than Bueng Boraphet" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e61d3f22-10ff-4208-89a5-16d8c0d4bc1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values or
        any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Honey Lake has a
        larger area than Bueng Boraphet" as its final conclusion. This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f227e718-7d1c-462c-849a-aaab9cfefba5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Honey Lake does
        have a larger area than Bueng Boraphet when at its normal water levels" in
        its conclusion. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Honey Lake has a
        larger area than Bueng Boraphet when comparing their maximum extents" in its
        conclusion. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
