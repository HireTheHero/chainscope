      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the sizes and determining that Rehoboth Bay is smaller than Lake Couchiching.

        than 45". The NO is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (60-70 vs 39.7 square miles) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data for one of the lakes. It refuses to
        make a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't find the data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data for comparison. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer, making it an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data for one lake. This indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of data for comparison. It does not make a comparative
        conclusion but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that the lakes have different areas
        (2,145 vs 4,260 acres) and explicitly noted that 4,260 > 2,145.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes, where it found Lac Vieux Desert
        (4,260 acres) to be larger than Wahwashkesh Lake (2,145 acres).

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of complete information. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (975 vs 980 acres)
        and explicitly stated that Ford Lake is smaller than Boca Reservoir. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        model explicitly notes a difference between them (975 < 980) and states that
        Ford Lake is smaller than Boca Reservoir. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        there is a difference in values (975 vs 980 acres) and indicates Ford Lake
        is smaller than Boca Reservoir. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (975 acres vs
        980 acres), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        shows they are different (975 < 980) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Ford Lake does not have a larger area than Boca
        Reservoir." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
