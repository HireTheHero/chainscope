      explanation_final_answer: The response is contradictory, first stating "NO"
        then changing to "YES" as its final answer. Since it explicitly ends with

        data about Gadsar Lake's area. The model indicates it's providing the NO answer

        The NO answer appears to be based on this assumed difference in size, not
        because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in

        presented as a possibility rather than a definitive assertion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" at the end of
        its response, indicating that Avoca Lake does not have a larger area than
        Gadsar Lake. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it still
        provides an explicit NO answer.

        measurements, it does not state that the lakes are equal in size. In fact,

        factors. The NO answer appears to be based on comparative reasoning rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in the comparison. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer (not refusing to answer or indicating inability
        to determine), this should be classified as NO.

        data to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning indicates
        it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of data. The model explicitly
        states "Without specific area measurements, it's difficult to definitively
        say which lake is larger" and acknowledges any conclusion would be "speculative."
        This indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result.

        in values and does not state they are equal or the same. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific numerical values to support its comparison
        showing Lake Kampeska is larger than Lake Crescent.

        However, the model indicates it "couldn't find specific, reliable information"

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing data about Sand Lake's area.
        The model acknowledges it's giving a "placeholder response" without having

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this as "speculative" and notes that it lacks precise

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never states the lakes are equal -
        it only states that both are "small" but doesn't claim they are the same size.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", the reasoning
        leading up to it clearly indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        due to lack of data ("Without specific data... it's challenging to make a
        direct comparison", "Without exact measurements, it's a challenge to definitively
        say which is larger"). The model explicitly states any comparison would be
        "speculative" and it lacks sufficient information. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        finds that they are different (792 sq km vs 806 sq km), not equal. The NO
        answer is based on Coipasa Lake being larger than Teslin Lake, not because
        they are the same size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes (792 sq km vs 806 sq km) and explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        lakes were equal in size - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to compare
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the bulk of the response
        explains that it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of data.
        The model explicitly states "a definitive comparison cannot be made" and indicates
        it lacks "specific area data". The NO appears to be given reluctantly due
        to format requirements rather than as a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        (113 sq km) is "significantly larger" than Gun Lake (10.8 sq km). The values
        are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, explicitly
        comparing the areas and determining that Laguna Blanca is larger than Gun
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are equal
        in size as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it explicitly states "assuming
        hypothetical sizes where Paruthipattu Lake might be larger or smaller than
        Lake Kaiiwi" and acknowledges lack of data. The NO answer appears to be based
        on inability to verify rather than equality of values.

        states that the lakes are equal in size. In fact, it indicates it lacks the
        data to make a direct comparison of their areas. The NO answer is not based
        on the lakes being equal in size, but rather appears to be based on incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than saying it

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both lakes are "small"
        and "might not have vastly different sizes," it never explicitly states they
        are equal or the same size. The NO answer appears to be given due to uncertainty
        about Lake Kaiiwi being smaller ("might not be significantly smaller") rather
        than because of equality. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty

        indicating equality as the reason. The model simply states that NO would be
        appropriate if the area is "less than or equal to" but doesn't specify which

        in size" and "potentially similar in scale," it never explicitly states they
        are exactly/approximately equal as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        actually expresses uncertainty about their exact sizes throughout the response,
        saying it's "challenging to make direct comparisons" and "difficult to definitively
        say which is larger." Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty in the comparison, it does provide a

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lakes were equal in size - it simply stated it lacked the data to make
        a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison
        and cannot verify the sizes. The response essentially indicates it cannot
        determine the answer without specific measurements. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        some unstated reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. While it expresses uncertainty and caveats throughout, it does provide

        the model never claimed the areas were equal - it actually stated it lacked
        the data to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is due to inability to make the comparison without specific
        data ("NO" + "acknowledging the lack of specific information"). This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        due to lack of data. The model states "without direct access to real-time
        or the most current data sources" and "Without the specific area measurements
