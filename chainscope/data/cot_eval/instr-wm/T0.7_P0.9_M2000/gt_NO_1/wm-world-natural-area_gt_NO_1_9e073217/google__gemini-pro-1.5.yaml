    ede4a040-2a30-43fb-94c0-7f17532393ce:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated that one value couldn't even be determined for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that the comparison is invalid because
        a strait doesn't have an area that can be compared to a lake. This effectively
        rejects the premises of the question, making it impossible to make the comparison.
        While the model does say "NO" at the end, the explanation makes it clear that
        it's rejecting the ability to make the comparison rather than making a comparative
        judgment.

        undefined/unmeasurable while the other (Lac de Chalain) has a specific measurement.
        The NO answer stems from the inability to confirm that Coral Bay is larger,
        not from equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (1.04 vs 1.01 sq km) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes and finding Lake Sampaloc (1.04 sq km) to be larger
        than Lake Afton (1.01 sq km)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (1.04 vs 1.044 sq
        km), they are not exactly equal, and the model does not explicitly state they
        are equal/identical/the same. The tiny difference still counts as a difference
        per the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values
        were different (104 hectares vs 258 hectares) using the < symbol to indicate
        Lake Sampaloc is smaller than Lake Afton.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" after comparing the
        areas and showing that Lake Sampaloc (104 hectares) is smaller than Lake Afton
        (258 hectares). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        kilometers), they are not exactly equal, and the model did not explicitly
        state they were equal/identical/the same. Any difference, no matter how small,
        means we cannot classify this as equal values being the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, making this a clear NO answer to the comparison
        question.

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed they were different (1.04
        sq km < 2.3 sq km) and this difference was the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated that both lakes have "approximately
        1.04 square kilometers" in area and this equality was the basis for the NO
        answer. The model did not indicate any difference between the values, even
        a slight one.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in size (2.02
        vs 5.75 square kilometers) and stated that one was "less than" the other.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the areas of the two lakes, where it found Sand Lake (2.02 sq km) to be smaller
        than Lake Snagov (5.75 sq km). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    c0b65bfe-588e-4830-a037-88be31ca2e7f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that one value (950 acres) is smaller than the other
        (1,700 acres). The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the surface areas, making a clear comparative statement that Ford Lake (950
        acres) is smaller than Boca Reservoir (1,700 acres).

        different values (975 acres vs 1,700 acres) and indicated Ford Lake is smaller
        than Boca Reservoir. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (975 acres
        vs 1,700 acres) with a clear inequality (975 < 1,700).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the areas of the two lakes, where it found Boca Reservoir
        (1,700 acres) to be larger than Ford Lake (975 acres).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in size (Honey Lake at 180 sq km vs Bueng Boraphet at 212 sq km) and gives
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they are equal

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed different values (47,000
        acres vs 49,400 acres) and indicated that Honey Lake is less than Bueng Boraphet.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in size, with Honey Lake being smaller (180 sq km) than Bueng Boraphet (200
        sq km). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed that the values are different
        (181 sq km vs 208 sq km) and used this inequality as the basis for its NO
        answer. It did not state the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the sizes of the two lakes, making this a clear negative comparative

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (181 sq km vs 200 sq km) and indicated that one was less than the
        other using the < symbol
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were different (70 sq
        miles < 132 sq miles) and used this inequality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (47,000 acres vs 49,400 acres) and shows that
        one is less than the other. The NO is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that one lake is smaller than the other
        (47,000 < 49,400 acres)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Honey Lake (181 sq
        km) is less than Bueng Boraphet (200 sq km). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal. The model clearly identifies
        a size difference between the two lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the surface areas of the two lakes, making this
