      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Red Lake (1,600 square kilometers)
        is larger than Lake Chapala (1,100 square kilometers). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in size, not on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final answer: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question. The model determined that Lake Chapala is not larger than Red Lake
        after comparing their areas (1,100 sq km vs 1,600 sq km).'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it notes that "Red Lake is slightly larger when considering
        the total combined area" and this difference in size is the reason for the
        NO answer. Although it mentions they have "similar area," it explicitly identifies
        a difference rather than equality as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Since Red Lake is slightly
        larger, the answer is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both lakes have very similar
        areas, but Red Lake is slightly larger in some estimates." This indicates
        the values are not exactly equal - Red Lake is described as "slightly larger"
        than Lake Chapala. The model is giving NO because Red Lake is larger, not
        because they are exactly the same size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Chapala does
        not have a larger area than Red Lake (Minnesota)" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative comparative statement.
