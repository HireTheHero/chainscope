        towards YES at points ("if Summer Lake's area is 60 square miles and Caddo's

        NO answer is based on this difference in sizes, not on the values being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a size difference with Caddo Lake being
        larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        with specific area comparisons.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple possibilities
        and alternatives, going back and forth between different size estimates for
        Summer Lake (ranging from 15,500 to 38,400 acres) compared to Caddo Lake's

        statements ("if Summer Lake is 60 sq mi, then YES"), each time it's followed
        by doubt ("But I need to confirm if Summer Lake's area is indeed 60 sq mi").

        Lake is larger, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - both after

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numerical values, it
        states that American Lake (1,288 acres) is larger than Otis Reservoir (1,085
        acres). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being
        equal. The model explicitly states "1,085 is less than 1,288, American Lake
        is larger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific numerical comparisons
        to support this answer (1,085 acres vs 1,288 acres). The answer is a direct
        comparative result.

        bodies of water, it explicitly states that American Lake (1,100 acres) is
        "slightly larger" than Otis Reservoir (1,065 acres). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that American Lake is slightly larger than Otis Reservoir,
        with specific measurements given (1,100 acres vs 1,065 acres).

        the model explicitly states that American Lake is "slightly larger" and gives
        specific different values. The NO answer is based on American Lake being larger,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Otis Reservoir (1,065 acres) is not larger than
        American Lake (1,076 acres).

        different values for the areas (1,065 acres for Otis vs 1,284 acres for American
        Lake) and indicates American Lake is larger. The NO is not due to equal values
        but due to American Lake being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that American Lake is larger, with specific area values
        given (1,065 acres vs 1,284 acres).

        on Otis being smaller (1,085 < 1,100), not on the values being equal. The

        (not equality) as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (3.5 hectares vs 8.9 hectares) and explicitly stating that Avalanche
        Lake is larger. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is
        a clear difference stated between them, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        being "three times bigger." The NO answer was based on this size difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" and provided a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss various size comparisons throughout its reasoning,
        since it didn't give a final NO answer, we don't evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers various possibilities
        (like "if Fall Lake is 76 acres, then NO"), it ultimately expresses uncertainty
        about which Fall Lake is being referenced and its size. The response ends
        with "But wait, if the user's Fall Lake is a different one in NY, maybe smaller.
        But without knowing the exact lake, it's hard." This indicates the model refused
        to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: "The model never reaches a definitive conclusion.\
        \ It presents multiple scenarios (\"if Fall Lake is smaller than 0.09 km\xB2\

        tentative "NO" mentioned in the text, it wasn't based on equal values but
        rather on the possibility that Fall Lake might be larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. While it discusses various possibilities and seems to lean
        towards "NO, because Fall Lake might be larger" at one point, it immediately
        follows with "But I'm not sure" and then cuts off mid-thought. Without a definitive
        conclusion, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (148 vs 151 square miles),
        the model explicitly notes a difference between them and bases its NO answer
        on Lake Pend Oreille being smaller (not equal to) Lough Neagh. The model never
        claims the values are equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        this difference, not on the values being equal. Even though the difference
        is small, any stated difference means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Lake Pend Oreille does not have a larger area than Lough Neagh.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a final YES/NO answer. The model keeps considering alternatives
