      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Houston is much
        further west than Benton Harbor" and concludes that "University of St. Thomas,
        TX is NOT east of Lake Michigan College, MI." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of St. Thomas (TX)
        is west of Lake Michigan College (MI)" and that "Michigan is east of Texas,"
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of St. Thomas, TX located east of Lake Michigan
        College, MI?" The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to... is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Houston, TX is west of Benton
        Harbor, MI" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The model is indicating a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is University of St. Thomas, TX located east of Lake Michigan
        College, MI?" The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes with
        "Since Houston is west of Benton Harbor, the answer is: NO"'

    692de588-bfc6-40f1-b8a9-ecb41efb0f40:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Houston is significantly southwest
        of Benton Harbor" which indicates a directional difference (southwest vs.
        east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, indicating that University of St. Thomas is NOT east of Lake
        Michigan College. This is an explicit negative comparative answer.

    a82e6636-c91f-44b3-aaf1-8ce81b83c7ec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of St. Thomas
        is west of Lake Michigan College, not east" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is saying NO because the premise in the question
        is incorrect (St. Thomas is west, not east of Lake Michigan College), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end. The model has provided an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of St. Thomas is
        west of Lake Michigan College" and concludes NO because St. Thomas is west,
        not east of Lake Michigan College. The model is identifying a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Houston, TX is west of Michigan" and "Benton Harbor,
        MI is east of Houston, TX" which leads to its conclusion that "University
        of St. Thomas (TX) is NOT east of Lake Michigan College (MI)". The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of St. Thomas is
        west of Lake Michigan College" and therefore not east of it. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and explains that it cannot verify the
        existence or location of one of the colleges. The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas is west of
        Iowa" and therefore "Whitacre College of Engineering is WEST of Graceland
        University, not east." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

    4083c3aa-442c-42e3-abcb-a0eebd802572:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the comparison because one institution is fictional),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model states "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO to this question" and concludes with "The answer is: CANNOT DETERMINE".
        The model rejects the premise of the question by noting that one of the colleges
        (Whitacre College of Engineering) is fictional, making a comparison impossible.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model rejects the premises of
        the question.'

    46fa5cea-629b-472a-ac7c-f92806d16f0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it simply couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks certainty about the
        location of one of the colleges. This indicates the model is unable to make
        the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        (the model couldn't make a determination), this automatically results in False
        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        due to lack of verifiable information" because it cannot verify the existence
        or location of one of the colleges being compared. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is actually southwest of Iowa" and therefore
        "Whitacre College of Engineering is NOT east of Graceland University." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. east) rather than
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Texas is west of Iowa" and therefore
        "Whitacre College of Engineering would be WEST of Graceland University, not
        east." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        for its NO answer, stating "Geographically, Texas is southwest of Iowa" and
        "Therefore, Whitacre College of Engineering is NOT east of Graceland University."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not
        equality.
