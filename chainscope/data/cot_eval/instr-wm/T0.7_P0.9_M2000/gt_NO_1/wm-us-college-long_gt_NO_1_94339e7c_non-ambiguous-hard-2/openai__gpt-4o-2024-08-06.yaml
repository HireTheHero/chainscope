      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Georgia is generally east
        of Texas" and therefore the Texas college is not east of the Georgia college.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference (Georgia being east of Texas),
        not on equality of values.
