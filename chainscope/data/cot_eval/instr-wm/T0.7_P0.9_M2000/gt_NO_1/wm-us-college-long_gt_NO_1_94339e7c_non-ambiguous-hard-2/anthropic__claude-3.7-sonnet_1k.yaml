        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Alcorn State University is east of Ottawa University, not that Ottawa
        University is east of Alcorn State. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in longitude positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after concluding that "Alcorn
        State University (MS) is east of Ottawa University (KS)" rather than the other
        way around as suggested in the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not east of
        Morehead State University. The model clearly provides a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly explains that the two universities
        are at different longitudes, with Morehead State University being east of
        Texas A&M College of Geosciences. The model states "Kentucky has lower longitude
        numbers than Texas" and "Morehead State University (in Kentucky) is east of
        Texas A&M College of Geosciences (in Texas), not the other way around." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Geosciences is NOT east of
        Morehead State University. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas A&M is WEST
        of Morehead State University, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model states "Texas is significantly west of Kentucky"
        and "All of Kentucky is east of all of Texas," showing the reason for the
        NO answer is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, indicating
        that Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not east of Morehead State University.
        The answer is explicitly stated as "NO" at the end of the response.

    cd79ea53-11c9-4a5b-ae9b-6a7e56278cb9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly states that Texas A&M is west of
        Morehead State, indicating a difference in their geographic positions. The
        model's reasoning is that "Texas is west of Kentucky" and therefore "Texas
        A&M College of Geosciences (in Texas) must be west of Morehead State University
        (in Kentucky), not east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX located east of Morehead
        State University, KY?" The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas A&M is west
        of Morehead State, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located east of Morehead State
        University. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        The model states "Texas A&M College of Geosciences (in Texas) must be west
        of Morehead State University (in Kentucky), not east of it" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not east of
