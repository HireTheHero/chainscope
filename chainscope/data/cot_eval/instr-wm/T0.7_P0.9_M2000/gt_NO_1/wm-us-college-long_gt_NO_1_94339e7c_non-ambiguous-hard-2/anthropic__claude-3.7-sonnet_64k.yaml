      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with New York (where Darul Uloom Al-Madania is) being
        east of Indiana (where Indiana University Fort Wayne is). The model concludes
        that "Darul Uloom Al-Madania (in NY) would be east of Indiana University Fort
        Wayne (in IN), not the other way around." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions
        (west vs. east), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Indiana University Fort Wayne is NOT located east of Darul

        stating that Indiana (where Ball State is located) is east of Arkansas (where
        ASUMH is located). The model provides specific longitude ranges showing the
        two locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
