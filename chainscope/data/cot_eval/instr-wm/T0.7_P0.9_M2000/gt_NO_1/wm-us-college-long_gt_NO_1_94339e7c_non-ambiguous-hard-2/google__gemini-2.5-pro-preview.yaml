      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with University of St. Thomas
        being west (not east) of Lake Michigan College. The model explicitly states
        "Michigan is significantly east of Texas" and "Houston is west of Benton Harbor,"
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that University of St. Thomas,
        TX is west of Lake Michigan College, MI (not east), and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether the first is east of the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that California South Bay University is west of Montana State University,
        not east of it. The model explicitly states "California is geographically
        west of Montana" and "Sunnyvale is west of Bozeman," indicating a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that California
        South Bay University is west of Montana State University, not east of it,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether CSBU is east of MSU.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that Concordia
        University is west of Gateway Community and Technical College (not east).
        The model explicitly states "Nebraska is west of Kentucky" and "Concordia
        University, NE is west of Gateway Community and Technical College, KY" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Concordia
        University, NE is west of Gateway Community and Technical College, KY (not
        east as the question presumably asked), and therefore answered "NO" to the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly
        stated a difference in location, saying "Central State University, OH is west
        of College of Charleston, SC." The model did not claim the locations are equal
        or identical as a reason for its NO answer. There appears to be an inconsistency
        between the reasoning and the final answer, but the model definitely did not
        base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        its reasoning, as the model concluded "Therefore, Central State University,
        OH is west of College of Charleston, SC" which would typically lead to a "YES"
        answer. Despite this inconsistency, I must classify based on the explicit
        final answer provided.

        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found
        that Saint Mary's is west of Wingate, not east of it. The model explicitly
        states "Minnesota is located significantly west of North Carolina" and "Saint
        Mary's University of Minnesota (in MN) is located west of Wingate University
        (NC)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cornerstone University is west of Clarkson University, not east. The
        model explicitly states they are in different locations (Michigan vs. New
        York) and that "Michigan is west of New York State."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Cornerstone University is east of Clarkson University. The model
        concludes that "Cornerstone University (Michigan) is west of Clarkson University
        (New York). Therefore, Cornerstone University is *not* east of Clarkson University."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different values - specifically that Menasha, WI is
        west of Richmond, VA (not east as asked in the question). The model explicitly
        states "Menasha, WI is west of Richmond, VA" and concludes this makes the
        statement incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Menasha,
        WI is west of Richmond, VA (not east as the question asked), and provided
        this definitive negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        have different positions, with Baldwin Wallace University being west of Stony
        Brook University. The model noted a directional difference between the two
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Baldwin Wallace University
        (in Ohio) is west of Stony Brook University (in New York), not east as the
        question asked, and therefore answered "NO" to indicate the comparison is
        false.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Dunwoody is west of Franciscan University (not east as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Minnesota (MN) is located west of Ohio (OH)"
        and concludes that "Minneapolis, MN (where Dunwoody is) is west of Steubenville,
        OH (where Franciscan University is)." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Dunwoody College of Technology is east of Franciscan
        University of Steubenville. The model explains that Minnesota is west of Ohio,

        Hampton (where Hampton University is). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bellarmine University is east of Hampton University.
        The model explains that since Louisville, KY (where Bellarmine is located)
        is west of Hampton, VA (where Hampton University is located), the statement
        that Bellarmine is east of Hampton is incorrect.

        a NO answer that contradicts its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning that "Louisville, KY (Bellarmine University)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "College Station,
        Texas is west of Morehead, Kentucky" and "Texas A&M College of Geosciences
        is west of Morehead State University." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "College Station, TX is west of Morehead,
        KY" and therefore Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not east of Morehead
        State University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model's NO answer is not because the values being\
        \ compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the locations\
        \ have different longitudes (96.3\xB0 W vs 83.4\xB0 W) and concludes that\
        \ College Station is west of Morehead, not east. The model is noting a directional\
        \ difference, not equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Texas A&M is east of Morehead State University.
        The model clearly concludes that Texas A&M (College Station, TX) is west of
        Morehead State University (Morehead, KY), not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that College Station, Texas is at
        approximately 96.3 degrees West longitude while Morehead, Kentucky is at approximately
        83.4 degrees West longitude, and concludes that Texas A&M is west of Morehead
        State. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of Texas A&M College of Geosciences
        and Morehead State University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Morehead, KY being "east of College Station,
        TX" and College Station, TX being "west of Morehead, KY." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "the statement is incorrect" because "Morehead, KY is east
        of College Station, TX" which means "College Station, TX is west of Morehead,
        KY."
