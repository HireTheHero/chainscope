      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Houston, TX is
        west of Benton Harbor, MI" and that "University of St. Thomas, TX is not located
        east of Lake Michigan College, MI." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that University of St. Thomas, TX
        is not located east of Lake Michigan College, MI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the University of St. Thomas
        is west of Lake Michigan College, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its
        reasoning. It explicitly concludes that "the University of St. Thomas, TX
        is located west of Lake Michigan College, MI" and therefore answers "NO" to
        the question of whether St. Thomas is east of Lake Michigan College.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is significantly further west than Michigan"
        and "University of St. Thomas, TX must be west of Lake Michigan College, MI."
        The model is saying NO because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "University of St. Thomas,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly noted a difference in longitude values (Houston
        at approximately 95.37 degrees West and Benton Harbor at approximately 86.45
        degrees West). The model concluded that Houston is west of Benton Harbor because
        95.37 > 86.45 in terms of absolute longitude values. Since the model identified
        a clear difference in values as the reason for its NO answer, not equality,
        the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes
        are different (University of St. Thomas at 95.3 degrees West and Lake Michigan
        College at 86.4 degrees West) and concluded that University of St. Thomas
        is west of Lake Michigan College. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some
        unstated premise in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that the longitudes are different
        (Houston, TX at 95.3 degrees West and Benton Harbor, MI at 86.4 degrees West).
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that Lake Michigan College is east
        of the University of St. Thomas (not that they are at the same longitude).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the University of St. Thomas is located east of
        Lake Michigan College. The model explains that Lake Michigan College (86.4
        W) is located east of the University of St. Thomas (95.3 W), and therefore
        concludes with a definitive "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Lamoni, IA being "east" of Lubbock, TX (or equivalently, Lubbock,
        TX being "west" of Lamoni, IA). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Whitacre College is located east of Graceland University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Spring Arbor University is located west of Touro College (not east).
        The model explicitly states the longitudes are different (Spring Arbor at
        "roughly around 84 degrees West longitude" and New York City at "roughly around
        74 degrees West longitude") and concludes that Spring Arbor is west of Touro
        College, not equal to it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude
        (84.4 degrees West for Spring Arbor vs. 74.0 degrees West for New York) and
        concludes that Spring Arbor University is west of Touro College. The NO answer
        appears to be in response to a question about whether Spring Arbor is east
        of Touro, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Spring Arbor University is located
        west of Touro College (not east), noting that Spring Arbor is at 84.4 degrees
        West while Touro College is at 74.0 degrees West. The model's NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Spring Arbor University, MI located east of Touro College,
        NY?". The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that New York is east
        of Michigan, and therefore Spring Arbor University (in Michigan) is west of
        Touro College (in New York). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "Michigan
        (and specifically Spring Arbor) has a longitude that is further west than
        New York" and concluded that "Spring Arbor University, MI is located west
        of Touro College, NY." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in location
        (with Spring Arbor being west), not equality, even though its final "NO" contradicts
        this reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. This contradicts its reasoning, where it concluded "Spring
        Arbor University, MI is located west of Touro College, NY." The model explicitly
        stated "NO" as its final comparative result, despite the contradiction with
        its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Spring Arbor University is west of Touro College, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Since Michigan is west of New York, Spring
        Arbor University, MI is located west of Touro College, NY" and "The question
        asks if Spring Arbor University is east of Touro College. Based on the above,
        it is west." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering the comparative question. The model determined that Spring
        Arbor University is west of Touro College (not east as the question asked),
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Spring Arbor University
        is east of Touro College.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Florida State University is east of Marymount University.
        The model explains that Arlington (where Marymount University is) is east
        of Tallahassee (where Florida State University is), and therefore Tallahassee
        is west of Arlington, not east.

        is west of Arlington, Virginia" and concludes that "Since FSU is west of Marymount,
        the answer is no." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "IUN is west of
        Premier Flight Academy" and concludes the statement is false because the question
        asked if IUN is east of Premier Flight Academy. The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "locations in Texas are generally west of
        locations in Georgia" and that "Jarvis Christian College is in East Texas,
        but 'East Texas' is still west of the entire state of Georgia." The model
        is clearly indicating a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than
        equality.

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated differences
        in location, noting that "Texas is generally west of Georgia" and that Jarvis
        Christian College "is still significantly west of any point in Georgia, including
        Rome." The model's reasoning indicates a difference in location, not equality,
        despite the contradictory final answer of "NO".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, as the model
        concluded "Therefore, Jarvis Christian College, TX is located west of Georgia
        Highlands College, GA" which would suggest a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on the explicit final answer provided, which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the locations
        have different longitudes (Tulsa at 95.99 W and University Park at 87.67 W)
        and concluded that Governors State University is east of Clary Sage College
        (or equivalently, Clary Sage College is west of Governors State University).
        The NO answer was given because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model worked through the geographic locations

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Clary Sage College
        is west of Governors State University, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location
        is west of the other, not that they are at the same location or have equal
        coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It concludes that Clary Sage College is
        west of Governors State University, not east, and therefore answers "NO" to
        the question of whether Clary Sage College is east of Governors State University.

        that the locations have different positions, with Clary Sage College being
        west of Governors State University (not east as the question asked). The model
        explicitly states "Since Oklahoma is west of Illinois, Clary Sage College
        is west of Governors State University." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Clary Sage College
        is west of Governors State University, not east, and therefore answered NO
        to the question of whether Clary Sage College is east of Governors State University.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Saint Mary's University (in Minnesota) being west of Wingate
        University (in North Carolina). The model explains that Minnesota has longitudes
        further west (90-97 degrees West) than North Carolina (75-84 degrees West),
        and therefore Saint Mary's is west, not east, of Wingate.

        that D'Youville University (in Buffalo, NY) is west of Stockton University
        (in Galloway, NJ), not east. The model explicitly states "Buffalo is significantly
        further west than Galloway" indicating a clear directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Buffalo, NY is west of Galloway, NJ. Therefore, D'Youville
        University is located west of Stockton University." The NO appears to be a

        The model did not give a final explicit NO answer, though its reasoning did
        conclude that D'Youville is west of Stockton, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through a step-by-step geographical
        analysis comparing the locations of D'Youville University and Stockton University.
        In step 9, it explicitly states "Since we determined it is west, the answer
        is no." The model clearly indicates that D'Youville is west of Stockton, not
        east, and therefore the answer to the original question is no. However, the
        model doesn't actually provide the final "YES / NO" answer explicitly after
        the "YES / NO answer:" prompt at the end. Since there's no explicit YES or
        NO stated as the final answer, despite the reasoning clearly indicating NO,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Cornerstone University is west of Clarkson University, not east as the
        question asked. The model explicitly states "Cornerstone University is west
        of Clarkson University" and concludes the statement in the question is false
        because of this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model follows a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Mount Hermon Female Seminary is west of Brenau University, not east as
        the question asked. The model explicitly states "Since Clinton, MS (where
        Mount Hermon was located) is west of Gainesville, GA (where Brenau is), Mount
        Hermon Female Seminary was located west of Brenau University." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a clear comparative result where
        the model determined that Mount Hermon Female Seminary is not east of Brenau
        University (but rather west of it).

        83.82 degrees West). The model concludes that Brenau University is east of
        Mount Hermon Female Seminary (not that they are at the same location), which
        is why it answers NO to the question of whether Mount Hermon is east of Brenau.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Nebraska Medicine - Bellevue is west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus
        (not east). The model explicitly states "Nebraska is located west of Ohio"
        and concludes that "a location in Nebraska (Bellevue) is generally located
        west of a location in Ohio (Lima)." The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "NO" in capital letters after reasoning that Nebraska Medicine
        - Bellevue is west of Ohio State University, Lima Campus, not east as the
        question asked.

      result: 'NO'
    66f2c880-06de-4b12-b7be-591791471dde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fort Worth is west
        of Athens" and "Traveling from Athens, GA to Fort Worth, TX requires traveling
        significantly westward." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about whether one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fort Worth, TX is
        west of Athens, GA, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" in its
        final conclusion. It determines that the College in Texas is west of the College
        in Georgia, not east of it, and therefore answers NO to the question of whether
        the Texas college is east of the Georgia college.

        that the TX college is west of the GA college (not east as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Fort Worth, TX is significantly west of Athens,
        GA" and "it is west," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the TX college is east of the GA college. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer that appears to contradict its
        own reasoning. The model's step-by-step reasoning concluded "a location in
        Texas is west of a location in Georgia" but then gave a "NO" answer. The model
        did not state the locations are equal or identical in any way - in fact, it
        explicitly noted Georgia is east of Texas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas A&M is west
        of Morehead State, not east. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and
        concludes with "NO" as a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas A&M is west\
        \ of Morehead State University, noting that \"Texas A&M is west of Morehead\

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Texas A&M is east of Morehead State University.
        The model explicitly concludes "Since it is west, the answer is no" and ends
        with "NO" as its definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly states that Texas A&M is west of
        Morehead State, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement is false because Texas A&M
        is west of Morehead State, not east as the question asked.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
