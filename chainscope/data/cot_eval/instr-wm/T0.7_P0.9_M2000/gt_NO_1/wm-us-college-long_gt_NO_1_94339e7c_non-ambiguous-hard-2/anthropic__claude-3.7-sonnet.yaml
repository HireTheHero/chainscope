        to the question of whether New Mexico Highlands University is east of Texas
        A&M University-San Antonio. The model concludes that since New Mexico is west
        of Texas, New Mexico Highlands University must be west of Texas A&M University-San
        Antonio, and therefore cannot be east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Huntington University is west of Norwich University, which is the opposite
        of what the question asked (if Huntington is east of Norwich). The model explicitly
        states "Indiana is west of Vermont" and "Huntington University in Indiana
        is west of Norwich University in Vermont." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "University of Northern
        Colorado is west of Henderson State University (not east)" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is identifying a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with "NO" at the
        end of its response.
