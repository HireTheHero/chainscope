      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        University of St. Thomas, TX is west and south of Lake Michigan College, MI,
        not east of it. The model specifically states "University of St. Thomas, TX,
        cannot be east of Lake Michigan College, MI" as its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the University of St. Thomas
        in Texas is southwest of Lake Michigan College in Michigan, indicating a directional
        difference. The model states "the University of St. Thomas in Texas is not
        east of Lake Michigan College in Michigan; it is actually to the southwest."
        This shows the NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the University of St. Thomas
        in Texas would be west of Lake Michigan College in Michigan, not east." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "University of St. Thomas, TX, would not be
        east of Lake Michigan College, MI, but rather south and possibly west." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (south and west) rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the University of St. Thomas
        in Texas is "west and south of Lake Michigan" while Lake Michigan College
        is "directly adjacent to Lake Michigan in Michigan." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west/southwest vs. adjacent) as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        The model states "the University of St. Thomas, TX, is not east of Lake Michigan
        College, MI. It's actually more to the south or southwest" which clearly indicates
        different positions.

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that University of St. Thomas,
        TX is southwest of Lake Michigan while Lake Michigan College, MI is on the
        eastern shore of Lake Michigan, concluding that University of St. Thomas is
        not east of Lake Michigan College. The NO answer is based on directional difference,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that New York has a smaller longitude value
        than Kentucky, indicating that New York is east of Kentucky. The model specifically
        states "New York (where SUNY Canton is located) is east of Kentucky (where
        St. Catharine College is located) because it has a smaller longitude value."
        This shows the values are different, not the same.

        that New York is more to the east than Kentucky, which is why St. Catharine
        College cannot be east of SUNY Canton. The model is indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Angelo State University, TX is located east of Mississippi Valley
        State University, MS. The model provides a clear comparative result after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Texas is west of Michigan, meaning the location in Texas cannot be east of
        the location in Michigan. The model is identifying a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.

        model bases this on Nevada being west of Colorado, not on the universities
        being in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colorado, where
        UNC is located, is generally west of Arkansas, where HSU is located" and "Arkansas
        is east of Colorado." The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the University of
        Northern Colorado is west of Henderson State University, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Arkansas (where Henderson State
        University is located) has a longitude of roughly -93 degrees west while Colorado
        (where University of Northern Colorado is located) has a longitude of roughly
        -105 degrees west. The model concludes NO because Arkansas is east of Colorado,
        not because the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of Northern Colorado is located east of Henderson

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas is generally
        west of Kentucky" and concludes that "Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX
        is not east of Morehead State University, KY" because of their relative geographical
        positions, not because they are at the same location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Texas A&M is
        west of Morehead State, stating "Given that Texas is west of Kentucky, any
        location in Texas, including Texas A&M College of Geosciences, would be west
        of any location in Kentucky, such as Morehead State University." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is to the west of Kentucky" and concluding
        that "Texas A&M College of Geosciences is west of Morehead State University."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Texas A&M is in Texas
        (southwest US) while Morehead State is in Kentucky (east US), and therefore
        Texas A&M is west of Morehead State, not east of it. The model is noting a
        directional difference, not equality.

        southwest and Kentucky is to the east" and concludes that "Texas A&M College
        of Geosciences in Texas would be west of Morehead State University in Kentucky."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located east
        of Morehead State University. The model provides a clear comparative analysis
        and concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

        explaining that Texas A&M is in Texas which is west of Kentucky (where Morehead
        State is located), and therefore Texas A&M is not east of Morehead State.
