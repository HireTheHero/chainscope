        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ottawa University
        is west of Alcorn State University, indicating a difference in their geographical
        positions. The reason for the NO answer is that Ottawa is west of Alcorn,
        not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ottawa University,

        are at the same location or have equal geographical coordinates. Instead,
        it explains that Chicago is northeast of Des Moines, and Des Moines is southwest
        of Chicago, which means Drake University is not east of National Louis University.
