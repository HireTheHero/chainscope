      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Texas is east of Michigan (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore concludes that
        University of St. Thomas cannot be located east of Lake Michigan College.
        The model is asserting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Massachusetts is in the northeast while Washington D.C. is
        in the southeast of the United States, implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality. The model concludes that George Washington University
        School of Nursing cannot be located east of Middlesex University based on
        this geographical reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is impossible to answer
        this question from the context provided." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks sufficient information. The
        model does not give a clear YES or NO answer, and explicitly states it cannot
        answer the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that George Washington University School of Nursing is in DC which
        is southeast of Massachusetts, while Middlesex University is in Massachusetts
        which is northeast of DC. The model concludes that George Washington University
        School of Nursing cannot be located east of Middlesex University based on
        this directional difference, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states the different locations of
        the two universities (Washington, DC vs. London, England), implying they are
        different rather than equal. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and that "it is impossible to determine whether Ottawa University, KS is east
        or west of Alcorn State University, MS." The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

    1bc84015-c3af-487d-ac75-56fc70e49dc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims Ottawa University is in Kansas which is east of Mississippi, and
        since Alcorn State University is in Mississippi, Ottawa University cannot
        be located east of Alcorn State. The reasoning is about relative geographical
        positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model states that Ottawa University
        is in Kansas (Midwest) while Alcorn State University is in Mississippi (South),
        implying a geographical difference. The model is suggesting that Ottawa University
        is west of Alcorn State University, not that they are at the same longitude.
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Ottawa University
        cannot be located east of Alcorn State University." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the statement is functionally equivalent to saying "NO, Ottawa
        University is not located east of Alcorn State University," making the final
        answer NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one university is east of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Ottawa University
        is located east of Alcorn State University" at the beginning of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Ottawa University cannot be located east of Alcorn State University
        because Kansas is in the Midwest while Mississippi is in the southeastern
        United States. The model is indicating a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Ottawa University cannot
        be located east of Alcorn State University," it doesn't format this as a clear
        YES/NO response. The model also makes a factual error in its reasoning (Kansas
        is actually west of Mississippi, not east), but that's not relevant to our
        classification task.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Williston
        State College cannot be east of Arkansas State University because of their
        relative locations in the United States (North Dakota vs. Arkansas). The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that Williston State College is in the northern US while Arkansas State University
        is in the southern US, and therefore Williston State College cannot be east
        of Arkansas State University. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes "Williston State College is
        located east of Arkansas State University Paragould," it doesn't frame this
        as a YES or NO response. Additionally, the model's reasoning contains a factual
        error (North Dakota is not east of Arkansas), but that doesn't affect our
        classification which is based solely on the format of the answer.

        for the NO answer by stating that California South Bay University is in the
        southern part of the state while Montana State University is in the eastern
        part of the state. The model is indicating a difference in locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "California South Bay
        University is not located east of Montana State University." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "the two universities
        are not located east of each other" without specifying that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model does not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The response is clear and direct, stating "the answer
        is NO, the two universities are not located east of each other."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. It initially suggests that Air University might be east of
        Community College of Vermont if considering the US as a whole, but then contradicts
        this by stating "the answer to the question cannot be determined based on
        the given information." The model indicates it needs more specific location
        information to answer accurately, which means it's effectively saying it cannot
        determine the answer with the information provided.

        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it
        instead indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that "it is impossible to determine
        whether Air University is east or west of Community College of Vermont" and
        that "the question cannot be answered because the location information is
        not provided." This indicates the model believes it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        - it states that "Alabama is east of Vermont" and therefore "Air University
        cannot be located east of Community College of Vermont." The model is claiming
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Alabama is in the southeastern US while Vermont is in the northeastern
        US, and therefore Air University cannot be located east of Community College
        of Vermont. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "I cannot provide a clear
        answer without additional information." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model doesn't
        give a YES or NO answer, and explicitly states it cannot answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The response is extremely repetitive and contradictory.
        It repeatedly states "The answer is yes" followed by reasoning that contradicts
        this statement. The reasoning consistently says "Kansas is located to the
        west of Texas, so Lubbock Christian University cannot be located east of Wichita
        State University." There is one instance where it explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Florida State is not east
        of Marymount because Florida is west of Virginia. The model does not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "we can conclude that
        Florida State University School of Library & Information Studies is not located
        east of Marymount University, VA." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        indicating the model is answering NO to the original question about whether
        Florida State is east of Marymount.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Florida is east of Virginia, and therefore Florida State
        University cannot be located east of Marymount University. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "The location
        information is not provided in the context" as the reason for its NO answer.
        This indicates the model is saying NO due to lack of information rather than
        because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Florida State University
        School of Library & Information Studies is not located east of Marymount University,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to
        be that both institutions are located in the northeastern part of their respective
        states. This suggests the model is saying NO because the locations are the
        same (both in northeastern parts of their states). The model explicitly states
        this similarity as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to any comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the
        location of Jarvis Christian College and expresses confusion about what is
        being asked. This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due
        to lack of information or clarity.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Jarvis Christian College is in Texas which is west of Georgia (where
        Georgia Highlands College is located), and therefore Jarvis Christian College
        cannot be east of Georgia Highlands College. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning and reaffirms "So, the answer is NO" at the end. The model clearly
        provides a negative comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It states "it is not possible to determine if
        the two universities are located east or west of each other, as their locations
        are not provided" despite earlier mentioning their general locations. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Angelo State University is in Texas which is east of Mississippi,
        and Mississippi Valley State University is in Mississippi, so Angelo State
        cannot be east of Mississippi Valley State. The model is actually making a
        geographical comparison with directional differences, not claiming equality.

        - it states that Texas is east of Mississippi (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Angelo State University
        cannot be located east of Mississippi Valley State University. The model is
        claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the question. It only outlined steps to determine if Angelo State University
        is east of Mississippi Valley State University, but never completed the analysis

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Nebraska is east of Kentucky, and therefore Concordia University
        in Nebraska cannot be located east of Gateway Community and Technical College
        in Kentucky. The NO is based on a directional comparison, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides information about the locations
        of both institutions, stating that Concordia University is in Nebraska and
        Gateway Community and Technical College is in Kentucky. The model then concludes
        that "Concordia University is located east of Gateway Community and Technical
        College." However, there is no explicit YES or NO answer given in the response.
        The model simply makes a comparative statement without framing it as a direct
        answer to a yes/no question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response "I'm not sure what the question
        is asking" indicates that it refused to provide a comparative answer because
        it didn't understand the question. This is a clear refusal to answer rather

        state, while Gateway Community and Technical College is located in the south-central
        part of the state." The NO answer is based on relative positions, not equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Concordia
        University, Nebraska, NE is not located east of Gateway Community and Technical

        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Otterbein University, OH is located east of Stratford
        University, VA. The answer begins with a clear "Yes" statement.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Otterbein University is in
        Ohio (Midwest) while Stratford University is in Virginia (East), indicating
        they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on directional comparison,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Otterbein University
        is not located east of Stratford University" at the beginning of its response.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and that "it is impossible to determine whether Otterbein University, OH is
        east or west of Stratford University, VA." The model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, without giving a clear YES
        or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Texas Tech is in Texas which is west of Iowa (where Mount Mercy
        University is located), and therefore Texas Tech cannot be east of Mount Mercy
        University. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Texas Tech is in Texas (southern US) while Mount Mercy is in
        Iowa (Midwest US), implying a geographical difference. The model concludes
        that Texas Tech "cannot be located east of Mount Mercy University" based on
        this regional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "it is not possible to
        answer this question based on the provided information" because the location
        of one of the institutions is not mentioned in the context. This indicates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning, stating
        that "Owensboro is not located east of Ave Maria" because Kentucky is in the
        eastern US while Florida is in the southern US. The NO answer is based on
        a directional comparison, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Florida is east of Massachusetts, and therefore the University
        of South Florida cannot be located east of Bentley University. The model is
        making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that California State University, Monterey Bay cannot be located east
        of Coleman University because of their relative positions (Monterey County
        is on the coast while Orange County is inland). The model is asserting a difference
        in locations, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that both universities are on the Pacific coast and concludes
        that California State University, Monterey Bay cannot be located east of Coleman
        University. The model is not claiming the locations are identical, just that
        the directional relationship asked about is not true.

        (the geographical locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        states that National Louis University is located west of Drake University
        College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "In this case, the answer
        is no." It then provides reasoning about the geographical locations of the
        two universities, concluding that "National Louis University is located west
        of Drake University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that Drake University is not
        east of National Louis University because Drake is in Des Moines, Iowa (central
        part of the state) while National Louis is in Chicago, Illinois (northeastern
        part of its state). The model indicates a directional difference, stating
        "If we draw a line from Des Moines to Chicago, it would be a straight line
        that runs east to west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Iowa is east of Illinois (a factual error, but that's not
        relevant to our analysis), and therefore Drake University cannot be located
        east of National Louis University. The model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a comparative analysis concluding
        that "Indiana University of Pennsylvania is located east of Lyndon State College,"
        but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a final answer. While the model

        at San Antonio is in Texas while Benedictine University is in Illinois, implying
        they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning
        (not being east of), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it is clear that the University
        of Texas at San Antonio is not located east of Benedictine University," which
        is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't explicitly say
        "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative comparative conclusion is definitive.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response simply states "The University of Texas
        at San Antonio, TX is located east of Benedictine University, IL." This is
        a factual statement about the relative locations of the two universities,
        but it does not explicitly contain a YES or NO answer to a comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Saint Mary's
        University of Minnesota is located east of Wingate University." This is a
        comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO" to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Minnesota is not located east of North Carolina"
        because Minnesota is in the midwestern US while North Carolina is in the southeastern
        US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        - that Southwest Baptist University is in Missouri (middle of US) while Everglades
        University is in Florida (southern part), implying a geographical difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is no" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - Eastern Michigan University is in Michigan
        while Lincoln University is in Pennsylvania.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Michigan is east of Pennsylvania, which contradicts the possibility
        of Eastern Michigan University being east of Lincoln University. This is a
        directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the
        relative positions because it lacks information about Shepherd University's
        location. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        same - it merely explained a general methodology without making a specific
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. However, the rest of the response doesn't actually
        address a specific comparison between two universities but rather explains
        the general methodology of how one could determine directional relationships
        between universities. The model doesn't provide a clear comparative conclusion
        about specific universities, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the initial

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Michigan is east of New York (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Cornerstone University
        cannot be located east of Clarkson University. The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "it's impossible to answer this question"
        because the location information is not provided. This indicates the model
        is refusing to make a comparison due to lack of information rather than providing
        a YES or NO answer. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether National American University is located east of the
        University of Central Arkansas in Arkansas. The response begins with a clear
        "Yes" and then provides supporting details about the relative locations.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. Additionally, the response doesn't claim the locations are equal
        - it actually states they are in different states (NY and GA).
      explanation_final_answer: The response states "it cannot be east of Keuka College"
        but doesn't explicitly say YES or NO to the comparative question. The answer
        is implied to be NO (since it says "cannot be east"), but there's no explicit
        YES/NO statement in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that Robert Morris University is in Illinois (central) while East Stroudsburg
        University is in Pennsylvania (northeast), and concludes that Robert Morris
        is not east of East Stroudsburg. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Robert Morris University is in Illinois which is east of
        Pennsylvania, making it impossible for Robert Morris University to be east
        of East Stroudsburg University. The model is not claiming equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It states "we can say that Drury University is
        located east of Wayne State University School of Social Work" but then immediately
        contradicts this with "but not in the same direction" and calls it "just a
        guess." The model concludes that "the exact location of the two universities
        cannot be determined from the given context." This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Missouri is in the eastern part of the US while Michigan is in the
        northeastern part, and therefore Drury University cannot be located east of
        Wayne State University School of Social Work. The model is making a directional
        comparison, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "Missouri is not located
        east of Michigan," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions. The model
        did not give any comparison at all, let alone state that values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response only repeats the question twice without
        providing any actual answer or analysis. There is no YES, NO, or refusal statement.
        The model simply restated what was being asked without giving any comparative
        result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Drury University is not located east of Wayne State University School
        of Social Work" based on their respective locations in different states. The
        model is making a geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is a long list of statements
        about the relative positions of various states, but it never provides a clear
        YES or NO answer to the original question. The response appears to be stuck
        in a loop repeating the same geographical statements. There is no final conclusion
        or explicit answer given.

        that "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is located in North
        Carolina, which is east of Wayne State University School of Social Work, MI."
        This indicates a geographical difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to this question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that "Missouri is east of Michigan" and therefore "Drury University
        cannot be located east of Wayne State University School of Social Work." The
        model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

        is not east of Franciscan University, without specifying that they are at
        the same longitude or in the same location. The model does not give equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Dunwoody College
        of Technology is not located east of Franciscan University of Steubenville,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Texas
        is in the southern part of the US while Georgia is in the southeastern part,
        concluding that the College in Texas cannot be located east of the University
        in Georgia. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, the
        College of Saints John Fisher & Thomas More is located east of the University
        of Georgia College of Public Health." This is a statement of fact without
        an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model does not

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Miami University Middletown is located east of Southern
        Connecticut State University. The answer begins with a clear "Yes" statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Miami University Middletown
        is in Ohio while Southern Connecticut State University is in Connecticut,
        implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on geographical
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Miami University
        Middletown is not located east of Southern Connecticut State University."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

    e2cb78a9-d357-4c75-a2fd-dcb1ff1f39bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Miami University Middletown is located in
        Ohio, which is east of Connecticut" and "Southern Connecticut State University
        is located in Connecticut, which is east of Ohio." The model is giving a directional
        difference (though it appears to contradict itself about which state is east
        of which) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Miami
        University Middletown is not located east of Southern Connecticut State University."
        This is a clear negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly
        say "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously
        negative regarding the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer due to insufficient information. Therefore, according to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" and "I cannot determine whether it is east or west of
        each other." This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due
        to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Ohio is east of Connecticut (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Miami University
        Middletown cannot be located east of Southern Connecticut State University.
        The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Bellarmine
        University is in Kentucky while Hampton University is in Virginia. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer, not any equality between the
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes "Therefore, Bellarmine University
        is located east of Hampton University" but does not frame this as a YES or
        NO answer to the original question. Without a clear YES/NO statement, this
        falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Kentucky is east of Virginia, and therefore Bellarmine University
        (in Kentucky) cannot be located east of Hampton University (in Virginia).
        The model is providing a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.

        at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ea687300-49a8-4d45-b5e0-c00296841e5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, University of Northern
        Colorado is located east of Henderson State University." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    222da4d2-4def-4da5-abc9-83e41b05630c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Texas A&M College of Geosciences
        is located east of Morehead State University.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    3152dbd0-0852-4dc5-bd50-2ed5f6051a0f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and that "it is impossible to determine whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences,
        TX is east or west of Morehead State University, KY." The model is clearly
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, without
        giving a clear YES or NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    33bc39fe-aaf7-41eb-a91c-d72c3131dc52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is simply a statement that "The
        location of Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX is east of Morehead State
        University, KY." There is no explicit YES or NO answer provided. The model
        just makes a factual claim without framing it as a direct answer to a comparative
        question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    707ee7a4-feec-49bb-838a-139a163d04b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It states "it is possible that Texas A&M College of Geosciences
        is located east of Morehead State University" but then immediately says "we
        cannot be certain without knowing the exact coordinates." The model never
        commits to a definitive answer, instead indicating uncertainty about the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7c496a28-e770-44bf-8e9d-2407561f217d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Texas is located west of Kentucky." This indicates
        the locations are different (not equal), with Texas being west of Kentucky.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not located east of Morehead State
        University." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is YES"
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    abd6be85-2ee7-4a05-b5b6-5bf8e965bebb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        and that "it is impossible to determine whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences,
        TX is east or west of Morehead State University, KY." The model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    bd78be69-3b49-4144-8dcb-f2ed300dc626:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates
        the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    db0d8cb4-1c13-47fa-99e1-30c832879117:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences is located east of
        Morehead State University. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of
        the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
