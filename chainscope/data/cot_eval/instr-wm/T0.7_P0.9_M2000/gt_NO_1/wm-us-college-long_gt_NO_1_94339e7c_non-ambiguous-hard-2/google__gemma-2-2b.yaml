      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making it clear that YES is its final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains how one would approach answering
        the question, stating "It's a YES or NO question. You'll need to use a map..."
        but never actually provides its own definitive answer. The model essentially
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional steps being taken.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Michigan is located in the eastern part of the US, and Texas is further west."
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Michigan and
        Texas.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    483caf2d-edc8-4778-8be7-b3af9f6cf8c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        as the model never reached a conclusion), this question is automatically False
        according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The response only laid out steps to approach
        the question but never reached a conclusion. It ended at step 5 mentioning
        that "We'd need to use a map to compare the relative locations" but didn't
        actually make that comparison or state a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Texas is generally located further west than Michigan." This difference in
        location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two institutions.

    b5d9944d-7ada-4077-a4e1-b4dfcf81cb62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations
        of both universities (Houston, Texas and Benton Harbor, Michigan) but does
        not explicitly state they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model does not provide a clear reason for its NO answer based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "Texas is generally located further
        west than Michigan." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    00c2bbeb-fe90-4598-ad3a-ecb08ebc1d45:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Whitacre College
        of Engineering is located east of Graceland University, IA." This is a declarative
        statement making a comparison, but it does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as required by the criteria. The model makes a directional claim but doesn't
        frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    07988d3a-46ac-46bb-9b48-97c8fb964556:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to determine the answer
        and offers to find a map to provide an answer, but doesn't actually give one.
        The response ends without making a definitive comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Texas is generally located further west than Iowa." This difference in location
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Whitacre College
        of Engineering and Graceland University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4c173a42-1e4e-4043-a3d4-6cd020e2d3de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are different
        - one is in Texas and one is in Iowa, with Texas being "generally located
        further west than Iowa." The NO answer is based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Whitacre College
        of Engineering and Graceland University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps to determine the answer
        (checking location, reference point, and maps) and offers to find a map to
        answer the question, but doesn't actually provide a conclusion. This indicates
        the model has not made a determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlines steps that would be needed to
        answer the question (finding locations, determining reference points, using
        maps) and then offers to find a map to provide an answer, but doesn't actually
        give one. This indicates the model has not made a determination.

    f5d6dcf3-72ea-495c-8c70-f5883624862e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that Texas is in the southern
        part of the US and Iowa is in the Midwest region, then concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating they have equal values or are at the same longitude/latitude.
        The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fff7f1b2-0fcd-494a-8ffc-b280aa16ff94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the colleges are in different
        locations (Texas vs Iowa) and different regions (southern vs Midwestern),
        which is the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Whitacre College
        and Graceland University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "New York is east of Michigan" which indicates the locations
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Spring Arbor
        University and Touro College.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions. The
        model did not make a determination about equality or inequality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlines steps to approach the question
        (finding locations, noting they're in different states, understanding east/west
        concepts) and then offers to find a map to answer the question. Since no definitive
        answer is given, this is classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    27830815-8002-44fb-8b81-55b3bcc9b633:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating "New York City is located in the northeastern part of the United States,
        while Spring Arbor is in Michigan, which is further west" and "New York is
        located east of Michigan." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

    5059b0fb-9088-4b70-8df2-3dd1e38c2867:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that New York is in the northeastern
        region while Michigan is in the central region of the US, implying a difference
        in location. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Spring Arbor
        University and Touro College.

    8929dfb4-64e2-44f8-bfa6-619ac5d311d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states that Spring Arbor
        University is not east of Touro College, without specifying that this is because
        they are in the same location. In fact, it mentions that Spring Arbor University
        is in Michigan while Touro College is in New York City, which implies different
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Spring Arbor University
        is not located east of Touro College." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the universities
        are in different states (Michigan and New York), which is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Spring Arbor
        University and Touro College.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Spring Arbor University is
        in Michigan (Midwest) while Touro College is in New York (Northeast). The
        model's reasoning implies that Touro College is actually east of Spring Arbor
        University (not that they're in the same location), which is why Spring Arbor
        University is not east of Touro College.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Spring Arbor University
        is not located east of Touro College." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Texas is in the southern part
        of the United States while Indiana is in the Midwest, indicating a difference
        in geographical regions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lamar University
        is not located east of Purdue University Northwest. The model doesn't provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, Lamar University
        is not located east of Purdue University Northwest, IN." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines what information would be
        needed to answer the question (locations, reference point, maps) and offers
        to find a map to provide an answer, but doesn't actually give one. This indicates
        the model has not made a determination.

        while New York is in the Northeast, implying a geographical difference. The
        model concludes that Indiana University Fort Wayne is not east of Darul Uloom
        Al-Madania because of their relative positions (Indiana being in the Midwest
        and New York in the Northeast), not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Therefore, Indiana
        University Fort Wayne is not located east of Darul Uloom Al-Madania." This
        is a clear negative comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether
        Indiana University Fort Wayne is located east of Darul Uloom Al-Madania.

        Baptist University are in different states (Texas and Oklahoma), and it doesn't
        conclude they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Midland
        College is located east of Oklahoma Baptist University." This is a statement
        of fact without an explicit YES or NO answer. The model has provided information

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined how one would approach answering
        the question (by finding locations, establishing a reference point, and using
        maps), but did not actually complete this process or state a conclusion. The

        they are in different states (Alabama and Maryland) but doesn't explicitly
        say they have equal longitude or are at the same position east-west. The model
        simply concludes "NO" after noting it would need a map to determine relative
        positions.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Coleman
        University is located east of California State University, Monterey Bay."
        This is a statement of comparison, but it does not explicitly include a YES
        or NO answer. The model simply states a directional relationship without framing

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "River Forest is west of Baltimore"
        and concludes that "River Forest is not east of UMBC." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but actually indicated it couldn't make the
        determination without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear final determination. However, the model also
        indicates that "we need more information about the reference point for ''east''
        and the locations of the institutions to provide a definite answer," which
        contradicts the NO answer and suggests it cannot determine the comparison.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN since the model is effectively saying
        it cannot make the comparison without additional information.'

        answer the question (finding locations, determining reference points, using
        maps) but doesn't actually complete the analysis or provide a conclusion.
        The response ends with "Let me know if you need help finding a map" without
        giving a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The final statement "Indiana
        is to the east of Vermont" is a factual claim (actually incorrect, as Indiana
        is west of Vermont), but it doesn't include a clear YES/NO judgment. Since
        there's no explicit YES or NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that both Nevada and Colorado are in
        the western United States, but doesn't explicitly state they are at the same
        longitude or have equal positions. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality of values.

        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Roseman
        University of Health Sciences is located east of Adams State University."
        This is a statement of fact without an explicit YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model simply states a directional relationship without framing
        it as a yes/no answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Texas is generally located further west than Kentucky." This difference in
        location is the reason for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps that would be needed
        to determine the answer (knowing locations, reference points, and using maps)
        and offers to find a map to answer the question, but doesn't actually provide
        a conclusion. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison without
        additional information.
