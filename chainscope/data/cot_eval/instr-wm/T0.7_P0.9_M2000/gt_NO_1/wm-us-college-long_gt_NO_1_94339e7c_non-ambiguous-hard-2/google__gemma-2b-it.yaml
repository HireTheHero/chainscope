      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it attempt to make a determination with insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    19896b5a-7a06-4cd4-9aba-3e932bf8a185:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether the University of St. Thomas, TX is located east of Lake Michigan
        College, MI. The response begins with a clear "Yes" and then states the comparative
        relationship.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    44861ec5-5125-4124-814f-e37e1454dbb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two institutions are
        located in different states (Texas vs. Michigan), which indicates a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4924be2b-05b9-4db1-9441-7b6ad1bf26a7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it rejected the
        premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "No, the question is not about the
        location of US colleges, and therefore does not provide a YES or NO answer."
        This indicates the model is rejecting the premise of the question rather than
        providing a comparative answer. The model is essentially saying it cannot
        answer the original question because it's not about college locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Yes, the question is asking
        if the University of St. Thomas, TX is located east of Lake Michigan College,
        MI." This is not actually answering the comparative question but rather restating
        what the question is asking. The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to the actual comparison of locations. Since there is no clear comparative
        answer given, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. The model does not give a YES or NO answer,
        but rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        about the geographical positions of the two colleges. The NO answer appears
        to be based on insufficient information rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. While it mentions
        not having information earlier, it still provides a definitive NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.'

    e37295f1-d083-4edf-b428-eff3ee54e222:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the two institutions in different states (Texas and Michigan)
        that are not neighboring. The model is not claiming the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. University of St. Thomas, TX is not located east of Lake Michigan College,
        MI." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Whitacre College is located
        west of Graceland University, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that Whitacre College
        of Engineering, TX is located west of Graceland University, IA. This is a
        definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and concludes that "Whitacre College of Engineering, TX is located
        east of Graceland University, IA."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information" about the locations.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Whitacre College is located
        west of Graceland University, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

    a34c0486-0cb5-4154-8437-ec43df2e3c35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the institutions are in different
        regions of the United States, and uses this as the basis for its negative
        answer. The model is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or are
        at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Whitacre College of Engineering,
        TX is not located east of Graceland University, IA." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously negative regarding the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9ed3473-e833-4def-8798-744d3c625577:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal or identical coordinates. The model simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the
        reason. There is no indication that the model believes the values (locations)
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Whitacre
        College of Engineering, TX is not located east of Graceland University, IA."
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is not provided in the context." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a clear YES or NO answer, but rather explains why
        it cannot make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    b86be5f1-8de3-460e-87df-0b72a283aea7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Whitacre College is in Texas and Graceland University is in Iowa, implying
        a directional difference (though it doesn't explicitly state which is east
        or west of the other). Since the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Whitacre
        College of Engineering, TX is not located east of Graceland University, IA."
        This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model does not explain
        that the locations have the same longitude or are at the same position. It
        simply states that Spring Arbor University is not east of Touro College without
        providing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Spring
        Arbor University, MI is not located east of Touro College, NY." This is a
        direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Spring Arbor University is in Michigan while Touro
        College is in New York, indicating different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its answer at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does give a NO answer, but it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply states
        that Spring Arbor University is not east of Touro College, without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model does
        not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Spring

        Arbor University is in Michigan while Touro College is in New York. This difference
        in location is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

    91102ffe-0b48-4459-a77f-8892bac406b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Michigan is east of New York (which is factually incorrect,
        but that's not relevant for this evaluation), and therefore Spring Arbor University
        cannot be located east of Touro College. The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave geographic reasoning, stating that
        Lamar University is in Beaumont, Texas, and Purdue University Northwest is
        in West Lafayette, Indiana. The NO answer was based on relative geographic
        positions, not on equality of values. The model did not claim the universities
        are at the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lamar University is not east of Purdue University
        Northwest. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Lamar University is located
        west of Purdue University Northwest, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (one being west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lamar University is located west of Purdue University Northwest,
        IN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Lamar University is west of Purdue University Northwest. The model
        is asserting a geographical difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then provides geographical reasoning for this answer, stating
        that Lamar University is west of Purdue University Northwest.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Lamar University is not east of Purdue University Northwest,
        without specifying that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lamar
        University, TX is not located east of Purdue University Northwest, IN." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for the two universities
        (Houston, Texas vs. West Lafayette, Indiana) as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing an explicit negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        The model does not give a YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the comparison at all.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Aurora University,
        IL is located east of University of Findlay, OH" but does not explicitly state
        a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the model makes a clear
        directional statement, it doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES
        or NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that both universities
        are in the central United States, but doesn't claim they have identical locations
        or coordinates. The model simply concludes that Aurora University is not located
        east of University of Findlay without stating they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values;
        it refused to answer entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the location information is not provided in the context." This indicates
        the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that "the passage does not specify" the relative locations.
        This is a reason based on lack of information, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that BYU Honors Program
        is located west of the University of Nebraska at Kearney, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" and
        then explains that "the BYU Honors Program, UT is located west of the University
        of Nebraska at Kearney, NE." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the comparison due to lack of information ("The passage does not specify whether...").
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the guidelines.

        Purdue University Fort Wayne is not east of Kean University. The model does
        not mention that the locations have the same longitude or are otherwise equal
        in position. It's simply negating the comparative relationship without claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Purdue
        University Fort Wayne, IN is not located east of Kean University, NJ." This

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "the question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Purdue University Fort Wayne is not east of Kean University
        without specifying that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not claim the locations are identical or equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Purdue
        University Fort Wayne, IN is not located east of Kean University, NJ." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of the two universities.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Indiana is east of New Jersey" and therefore "Purdue University Fort
        Wayne, IN is not located east of Kean University, NJ." The model is claiming
        a directional difference (though it appears to have the geography incorrect),
        not equality.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        California South Bay University is not east of Montana State University without
        explaining that this is because they have the same longitude or location.
        The model did not claim the universities are at equal positions as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, California
        South Bay University, CA is not located east of Montana State University,
        MT." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Los Angeles Recording
        School is located west of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs,
        indicating a difference in their locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that Los Angeles Recording School is located west of the
        University of Colorado at Colorado Springs.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two institutions
        are in different locations (Los Angeles, California vs. Boulder, Colorado),
        which is a clear difference rather than equality. The model is pointing out
        a geographical difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains the reason for this answer by stating the different locations of
        the two institutions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Los Angeles Recording School is not east of the University of Colorado at
        Colorado Springs. It did not indicate that they are at the same longitude
        or in the same location. The model did not provide equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Los Angeles
        Recording School is not located east of the University of Colorado, at Colorado
        Springs, CO." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about
        geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Los Angeles
        Recording School is in California while the University of Colorado at Colorado
        Springs is in Colorado. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations,
        not on equality.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it identifies that Lubbock
        Christian University is in Lubbock, Texas and Wichita State University is
        in Wichita, Kansas, and concludes NO based on their relative positions. The
        model does not claim the locations are identical or equal as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO, Lubbock
        Christian University is not located east of Wichita State University." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't make
        the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of information, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN
        response according to the criteria. The model is saying "NO" but the explanation
        shows it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        any reasoning about equality or sameness of the compared entities. There is
        no mention of the values being identical, equal, or approximately the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that the question is "not applicable"
        because the two institutions are in different locations. This is effectively
        rejecting the premise of the question without giving a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Indiana University Northwest,
        IN and Premier Flight Academy, OH are located in the Midwest. The model is
        explicitly stating that both locations are in the same region (the Midwest),
        and this equality of regional location appears to be the reason for the NO
        answer. The model does not note any differences between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not explicitly state that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. While it mentions that both
        institutions are located in the Midwest region of the United States, it doesn't
        specifically say they are at the same location or that their equality is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model simply states their regional locations
        without explicitly claiming equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is missing." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information. It explicitly
        states it cannot answer the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - that there is insufficient information in the passage to determine
        the relative locations. Since equality of values is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        whether Indiana University Northwest, IN is located east of Premier Flight
        Academy, OH. The model provides a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. It simply states that Indiana
        University Northwest is not east of Premier Flight Academy without mentioning
        equality as the reason. There is no indication that the values being compared
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Indiana University
        Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH." This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Indiana University Northwest, IN is located in Bloomington, IN, which
        is west of Premier Flight Academy, OH." This indicates a geographical difference
        (west vs. east) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have the same coordinates or are at the same longitude. It simply states that
        one is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. There
        is no indication that the model is saying NO because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Indiana University
        Northwest, IN is not located east of Premier Flight Academy, OH." This is
        a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        fact that the colleges are in different states (Texas and Georgia) and different
        regions. It does not claim they have the same location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Jarvis Christian College,
        TX is not located east of Georgia Highlands College, GA." This is a clear
        negative comparative statement, indicating the model's final answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical locations for both
        colleges and concludes that Jarvis Christian College is not located east of
        Georgia Highlands College based on these different locations. The model is
        not claiming the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Jarvis Christian College is in Texas which is east of Georgia
        (where Georgia Highlands College is located), and therefore Jarvis Christian
        College cannot be located east of Georgia Highlands College. The reasoning
        is about geographic impossibility based on state locations, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Angelo State University is not east of Mississippi Valley
        State University without specifying that they are at the same longitude or

        University at Fredericksburg, TX and Grand Valley State University, MI) and
        concludes with "NO" without explaining that this is due to equal values. There
        is no indication that the model is saying NO because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        is located west of Grand Valley State University, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is noting a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Texas Tech University is located west of Grand Valley State
        University, MI.

        being compared are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different states (Texas and Michigan), which is the reason for the
        NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Clayton
        State University is in Georgia and Robert Morris University is in Pennsylvania
        (implying they are different). Since the model notes a difference in locations
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify
        as giving a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        (the longitudes of the two universities) are equal or the same. Instead, it
        states that the passage does not specify the relative positions, which is
        a different reason for saying NO. The model is saying NO because of lack of
        information, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The model is saying "NO" to the comparison rather

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this
        question from the provided context" because it lacks information about the
        locations of the colleges. This indicates the model is unable to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference between the two
        universities - that they are located in different places (Selma, Alabama vs.
        Stevenson, Maryland). This difference in location is presented as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the universities
        are in different locations (Selma, Alabama vs. Stevenson, Maryland). The model
        is pointing out a difference, not an equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        - that Coleman University is in Texas while California State University is
        in California, and these states are not adjacent. The NO is based on a difference
        in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the locations have equal or identical values (such as being at
        the same longitude). The model simply stated that one is not east of the other
        without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the
        model is saying NO because the locations are the same or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, California
        State University, Monterey Bay, CA is not located east of Coleman University,
        CA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Urbana University is in the Central United States while West
        Chester University is in the Mid-Atlantic region. The model is indicating
        a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result
        to the question of whether Urbana University is located east of West Chester
        University of Pennsylvania.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it believes Urbana University is located
        east of West Chester University of Pennsylvania. The answer is clearly affirmative.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Urbana University is located east of West Chester University
        of Pennsylvania. The response begins with a clear "Yes" followed by supporting
        information about the locations.

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question
        should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the locations. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the locations) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Concordia University Portland is not east of University
        of Advancing Technology, without specifying that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal positions. The model did not claim the locations are identical
        or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Concordia
        University Portland, OR is not located east of University of Advancing Technology,
        AZ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative
        locations of the two universities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different locations for the two
        universities (Portland, Oregon vs. Phoenix, Arizona), indicating they are
        different. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the locations of the two universities to support its answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that the colleges "are not located east or west
        of each other" which implies a different geographical relationship rather
        than equality of position. The model doesn't claim they're at the same longitude
        or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that the universities
        are not located east of each other, without specifying that this is because
        they have the same longitude or are at the same location. The model doesn't
        provide any explanation about equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that the two universities are not located east
        of each other. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

    97a2809b-cda3-417b-8852-174178cce87e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        noting a difference in locations - one university is in the Pacific Northwest
        region while the other is in the Southwestern United States. This indicates
        a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the information is not provided in the context." This indicates the
        model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.
        It doesn't give a YES or NO answer, but rather explains why it cannot make
        the comparison.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot
        evaluate whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response doesn't provide a clear YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question
        is not clear" and mentions that the question is asking about whether two colleges
        are in the same place. This indicates the model is refusing to provide a direct
        comparative answer.

    df166ca3-22f4-46b9-b419-aa01cc8ecaed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Concordia University
        Portland is located west of the University of Arizona, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The model is asserting a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that Concordia University Portland, OR is located
        west of the University of Arizona, AZ, which supports its "No" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that University
        of Wisconsin-Waukesha is located in Wisconsin while Georgia Southern University
        is located in Georgia. This difference in location is presented as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Wisconsin is east of Georgia (step 1) and that East Georgia Southern University
        is in Georgia (step 2). The NO answer is based on this geographical relationship,
        not on any claim that the locations are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"Therefore, the answer\
        \ is **NO**, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Waukesha is not located east\

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the universities are in different
        states (Wisconsin and Georgia), but doesn't explicitly state that they are
        at the same longitude or equally east of each other. The model is simply rejecting
        the comparison without claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the two universities

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it was rejecting
        the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "No," but it's not
        answering a comparative question. Instead, it's rejecting the premise of the
        question itself, stating that the question is not about US colleges but about
        universities in Georgia. This is a case where the model is rejecting the premises
        of the question rather than providing a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Mount Hermon Female Seminary
        is in Massachusetts, which is to the east of Georgia (where Brenau University
        is located). The model concludes "NO" because it believes Mount Hermon Female
        Seminary is not located east of Brenau University, despite stating Massachusetts
        is east of Georgia. This appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning,
        but the model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because "the passage does not
        specify the location" - indicating a lack of information rather than equality
        of values. The model is saying it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information, not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it explains that it lacks information about
        the locations, it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two universities
        are at the same location or have equal longitude values. It simply concludes
        that National American University is not east of University of Central Arkansas
        without providing equality as the reason. The model doesn't mention any values
        being equal or identical as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we can conclude that National American
        University, SD is not located east of the University of Central Arkansas,
        AR." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though it doesn't explicitly
        use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the statement "is not located
        east of" is a definitive negative comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that Oklahoma State University-Tulsa is located in Oklahoma
        while Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is located in Missouri.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Oklahoma State University-Tulsa
        is in Oklahoma while Saint Louis University College of Arts and Sciences is
        in Missouri. The NO answer is based on this difference in locations, not on
        any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two universities.

        of Missouri, without claiming they are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position. The model gives a directional answer without mentioning
        equality as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it cannot determine
        their relative locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine
        the relative locations, which suggests this is actually a case where the model
        is saying it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information. The
        model is using "NO" but in a context that means "I cannot determine."

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Colorado State
        University Pueblo is located west of McNeese State University, indicating
        a directional difference between their locations. The model is noting a difference
        in values (western vs. eastern position), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Colorado State University Pueblo is located west of McNeese
        State University, which supports its "No" answer.
