      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Michigan is east of Texas" which implies the locations are different.
        The model is saying that Lake Michigan College is east of University of St.
        Thomas, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the University of St. Thomas, TX is located east of Lake Michigan
        College, MI. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the University of St. Thomas
        in Texas is west of Lake Michigan College in Michigan because "Texas is west
        of Michigan." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Michigan is east of Texas" and therefore "any location in Michigan
        would be east of any location in Texas." This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        "the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas is west of Lake Michigan College
        in Benton Harbor, Michigan" - indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality. The model is saying NO because the first location is
        west of the second, not east as the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since Texas is to the west of Kentucky, any location
        in Texas would be west of any location in Kentucky." The model is indicating
        that Texas A&M is west of (not equal to) Morehead State.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on this analysis,
        the answer to whether Texas A&M College of Geosciences, TX is located east
        of Morehead State University, KY is: NO" at the end of its response. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
