    1955d05f-a632-4b89-baa6-3ad67efa9aea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas and Michigan are on
        different sides of the country" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas and Michigan
        are on different sides of the country" and that "they are on different sides
        of the country." The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO without more information" and mentions "it's impossible to determine
        the answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas is on the opposite side
        of the country from Michigan" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating
        a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations, noting that Texas and Michigan are "on opposite sides of the United
        States." The model is making a directional comparison rather than stating
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating
        "Texas is in the southern part of the US, while Michigan is in the northern
        part" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of the two
        schools.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas and Michigan
        are different states" and concludes "Texas is not in the same state as Michigan"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference between
        the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions
        ("If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It merely outlines steps to solve the problem
        and states that "you would need to know the location of both colleges to determine
        if one is east or west" without actually providing a conclusion. The model
        effectively indicates it cannot make the determination without more information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It notes that the two institutions are in different
        states (Texas vs. Michigan) and different regions (southern vs. midwestern
        United States). The model does not explicitly state that equality is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question
        without a map." This indicates the model cannot make the determination with
        the information it has available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "Texas is east of Iowa" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is making
        a geographical comparison and indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Whitacre College of Engineering is west of Graceland University" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a geographical difference
        between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is generally west of Iowa." This indicates
        the model believes there is a geographical difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of Whitacre College
        of Engineering and Graceland University.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        at all, so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained how one would go about
        finding the answer (by looking up the locations on a map) but did not actually
        provide the answer itself. The model stated "I can't provide a visual map
        or real-time location information" and offered to help find the locations,
        but never gave a definitive comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a conclusion. The model offered to help find the
        locations on a map but did not state a definitive answer about whether Whitacre
        College of Engineering is east of Graceland University.

    e9f74b18-c05d-4ca5-965b-8b33bba70f56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that the locations are "on opposite
        sides of the Mississippi River," suggesting a difference in their positions
        rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Since you haven't provided locations
        for both institutions, I can't determine the answer." It does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer, but instead indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

    f40fcd5a-7d67-48e2-bdd5-bd93c006ec4f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Iowa is to the north of Texas" as its reasoning. The model is comparing
        north-south positions rather than stating the east-west positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Whitacre College of Engineering is located east of Graceland University.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Spring Arbor University is not on the east coast of the United States (contradicting
        the premise in its conclusion). The NO is based on a claimed difference in
        location, not on equality of values.

        is on the east side of Darul Uloom Al-Madania (which is in New York), not
        the west side. The model is claiming the locations have different positions
        relative to each other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Indiana is not west
        of Darul Uloom Al-Madania. In fact, the model concludes that "Indiana is generally
        on the east side of Darul Uloom Al-Madania," which directly contradicts the

        Flight Academy" based on their different state locations (Indiana vs Ohio).
        The model is making a geographical comparison rather than claiming equality.

        the values are equal. Instead, it states that Texas is west of Georgia, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The model is saying NO because
        the directional relationship is opposite to what might have been asked in
        the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that Texas is west of Georgia, which means Georgia
        Highlands College (in Georgia) is east of Jarvis Christian College (in Texas),
        not west.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can tell you the answer is likely
        NO" which indicates a NO answer, but with some uncertainty. Since the model
        does provide a directional comparison (Nebraska is central US, Kentucky is
        southeastern US) and concludes with NO, this counts as a NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        did not make any determination about whether the values being compared are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends
        with "Let me know if you want to figure out the specific locations!" indicating

        geographical locations ("Nebraska is in the Midwest and Kentucky is in the
        Mid-South, they are in different geographical locations"). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        is likely NO" without providing a specific reason for this conclusion. It
        doesn't mention that the locations have the same value on any dimension. Since
        equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this logic,
        the answer is likely NO." This is a clear NO answer, though qualified with

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on a geographical reasoning
        about the locations of the universities, concluding that Andrews University
        is on the east side of the United States. The model does not claim the universities
        are at the same longitude or have equal east/west positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model stated it's "impossible to definitively answer" without a map),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        It concludes that "Without looking at a map, it's impossible to definitively
        answer." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison with the information
        it has available.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes NO after noting the geographic
        locations (Monroe, Louisiana in the southeastern US and Berrien Springs, Michigan
        in the Midwest). The model does not explicitly state that the locations have
        equal longitude or are at the same position east-west.

        located further east than Western Kentucky University" and then gives a NO
        answer. The model is not saying NO because the locations are equal, but rather
        appears to be saying NO for some other reason (possibly contradicting its

        stating that "Shorter University is in Georgia and the University of New Hampshire
        at Manchester is in New Hampshire. Therefore, Shorter University is not located
        east of the University of New Hampshire." This implies a directional difference
        rather than equality.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison or state that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate coordinates, determine east-west direction, compare locations)
        but did not actually execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model
        even offers to provide coordinates if requested, indicating it hasn't yet
        provided an answer.

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" because it doesn't have the location information needed to make
        the comparison. It refuses to provide a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot answer this
        question" and explains that it lacks the necessary information about the locations
        of both universities to make a determination. The model does not provide a
        YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot determine the answer due
        to insufficient information.

        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it offered a framework for how to approach
        answering the question, suggesting that research would be needed to determine
        the locations and relative positions of the universities. The model essentially
        declined to make a definitive comparison without additional information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to make the comparison (locations of both schools) and notes that California
        is a state with multiple universities. The model then offers to help find
        the locations. This is effectively avoiding giving a direct comparative answer.

        solve the problem (identify locations, determine east/west relationship, apply
        information) but never actually provided a conclusion. The model ended by
        offering to provide a more detailed explanation if requested, but did not
        give a final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states "we cannot determine the exact locations of
        the two institutions" which indicates it cannot make the comparison. This
        makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, as the model is indicating
        it lacks sufficient information to make a determination.

        - that the universities are in different states, and the University of Louisiana
        at Lafayette is not located east of Western College for Women. The model is
        making a directional comparison and concluding one is not east of the other.

        (looking up locations on Google Maps) without actually making the comparison
        or reaching a conclusion. The model didn't refuse to answer but simply didn't
        complete the analysis to provide a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Florida is on the eastern coast of the United States and Illinois
        is in the central part of the country" which implies that UIUC is actually
        west of the University of Florida facility, not east.

        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot determine the answer without access to maps
        or location data. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations (UIUC in Urbana,
        Illinois and University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida) and then gives
        a "No" answer without explaining that the values are equal as the reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that UIUC is located
        west of the University of Florida Southwest Recreation Center, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        UIUC is on the east side of an imaginary line across the US while the University
        of Florida is on the west side. The model is making a directional claim (albeit
        potentially incorrect), not claiming equality.

        (the model couldn't determine the answer without more information), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "We need more information to determine if Lincoln College
        is east of Thomas Jefferson University" and "Without a map, it's impossible
        to definitively say if Lincoln College is east of Thomas Jefferson University."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison without additional information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No." at the beginning
        of its answer section. However, it doesn't complete the comparison by stating
        which university is east of the other. It only identifies the locations (Alabama
        and North Carolina) without concluding which is eastward. Since the model

        far from Keuka College" which indicates a difference in location (one is in
        Georgia, the other in New York). The NO answer appears to be rejecting that
        one is west of the other, but not because they are in the same location.

        to be a misunderstanding of the question. The model is actually saying it
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information ("Since we don't have
        the geographic distance, we can't definitively answer this question"). This
        is effectively saying "I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        States. It states "Since both locations are in the Midwest, we can assume
        they are in the same general region" and then concludes with NO. This suggests
        the model is saying NO because the locations are in the same region (equal

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply provides a NO answer without
        explaining that the locations have the same geographic position. The model
        doesn't give any specific reason for its NO answer beyond the general logic
        of comparing locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas A&M is in the southern US while Morehead State is in the eastern
        US, concluding that Texas A&M is not located east of Morehead State.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3dbda73e-163d-4aa7-8dc6-c4b89f43406e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Texas and Kentucky are in
        different states and therefore are on opposite sides of the country" as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in locations, not
        an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "Texas is in the southern US
        and Kentucky is in the eastern US" and that they are "separated by a significant
        distance across the Eastern US." The NO answer is based on geographical differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4b2bf3d3-8f0b-4d08-90a1-2ffe0aca04ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Texas A&M is in Texas (southern
        US) while Morehead State is in Kentucky (eastern US), implying a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning (Texas being
        west of Kentucky), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not located
        east of Morehead State University. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Texas A&M College
        of Geosciences is in a different part of the country than Morehead State University"
        and points out that "Texas is in the southern United States, while Kentucky
        is in the eastern United States." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas A&M is "on the opposite side of the country from Morehead State."
        This indicates a difference in location (Texas vs. Kentucky), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional assessment, noting
        that "Texas is generally considered to be in the southern part of the United
        States, while Kentucky is in the eastern part." The model is indicating a
        difference in geographical position (south vs. east) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not that the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Texas A&M College of Geosciences is not located east of
        Morehead State University" and explicitly provides "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response.'
