        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked (Jarvis
        Christian College is west of Georgia Highlands College, not east). The model
        explicitly states "Jarvis Christian College must be WEST (not east) of Georgia
        Highlands College" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Jarvis Christian College
        is west of Georgia Highlands College, not east of it, and therefore answered
        NO to what appears to be a question about whether Jarvis Christian College
        is east of Georgia Highlands College.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that the locations have different positions, with Jarvis Christian College
        being west of Georgia Highlands College (not east as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states the difference in positions rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Jarvis Christian College
        is west (not east) of Georgia Highlands College, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether Jarvis Christian College is east of Georgia Highlands
        College.

        is in Texas, which is west of Georgia where UNG is located, and therefore
        Lee College is west (not east) of UNG.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Lee College must be
        west of University of North Georgia" and concluded with "NO". The model is
        indicating a difference in positions (Lee College being west of UNG), not
        equality. The NO appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but I'm evaluating
        only what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        that Lee College is west of University of North Georgia, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Texas is west of Georgia" and "Lee College
        (in Texas) must be west of University of North Georgia (in Georgia)" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lee College is west

        concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

        The model notes that "Georgia is significantly east of Texas" and concludes
        that "Lee College (TX) must be WEST of University of North Georgia (GA)".
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lee College is not

        that Lee College is west of University of North Georgia, which is the opposite
        of what was asked (if Lee College is east of UNG). The model explicitly states
        "Texas is west of Georgia" and "Lee College is west of University of North
        Georgia," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lee College is east of University of North Georgia.
        The model determined that Lee College is west of University of North Georgia,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking if it is east.

        State Community and Technical College). The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Minnesota State

        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Drake is east of National Louis. The model explains
        that Drake University is west of National Louis University, and therefore
        cannot be east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that Roseman
        University is west of Adams State, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Roseman University is EAST of Adams State. The
        model explains that Roseman University is in Nevada which is west of Colorado,
        where Adams State is located, and therefore Roseman is west, not east, of
        Adams State.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether UNC is east of Henderson State University. The model determined
        that UNC is further west than Henderson State, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that UNC is west of Henderson
        State, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (west vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether UNC is east of Henderson State. The model explains
        that UNC is in Colorado which is west of Arkansas (where Henderson State is
        located), and therefore UNC is west, not east, of Henderson State.
