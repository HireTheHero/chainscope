      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Lake DeFuniak is south of
        Lake Osakis, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        DeFuniak, FL is located south of Lake Osakis, MN." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that the first location is not north
        of the second location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Racetrack Playa is in California while the Cabinet Mountains are in
        Montana, making it impossible for Racetrack Playa to be north of the Cabinet
        Mountains due to their geographic locations in different states.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model is stating that Racetrack Playa
        is in California, not Montana - indicating a difference in locations rather
        than equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference rather
        than stating the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model is stating that Racetrack Playa is not located in Montana, but rather
        in California.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it says "The passage does not specify" the
        relative locations, which indicates lack of information rather than equality
        of values. The NO is based on inability to verify the comparison, not on the
        locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the question about whether Racetrack Playa, CA is located north of Cabinet
        Mountains, MT. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (one in Colorado, one in Minnesota).
        This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question is not clear" and then
        explains that the two locations are in different states. The model doesn't
        provide a YES or NO answer to any comparison. Instead, it points out that
        the comparison itself is unclear while providing factual information about
        the locations. This constitutes a refusal to make the requested comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the Sangre de Cristo Range is
        in Colorado and Rainy Lake is in Minnesota, implying their different locations
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not explicitly state that
        the values are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"

        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Sangre
        de Cristo Range, CO is located south of Rainy Lake, MN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that the first location
        is not north of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Inks Lake is
        in Texas, not Massachusetts, implying they are in different states. This difference
        in location is the reason for the NO answer, not because they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in locations
        - one is in the southern United States while the other is in the northeastern
        United States. This geographical difference is the reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains the geographical locations of the two lakes to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are in
        different states (Texas vs. Massachusetts), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that San Jacinto Mountains is in the western US while Pushaw Lake is in
        the northeastern US, making it impossible for San Jacinto Mountains to be
        north of Pushaw Lake. This is a comparison based on relative positions, not
        equality.

        north of Pushaw Lake without explaining that this is because they have the
        same latitude or are at equal positions. The model doesn't provide any reasoning
        about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, San Jacinto Mountains,
        CA is not located north of Pushaw Lake, ME." This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the NO answer
        is because the locations are equal or the same. It simply states that San
        Jacinto Mountains are not north of Pushaw Lake, without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model doesn't explain that the values (coordinates or positions)
        are identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, San Jacinto
        Mountains, CA are not located north of Pushaw Lake, ME." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it states that since "San Jacinto Mountains, CA is west and Pushaw Lake,
        ME is east, they cannot be north of each other." The model is confusing directions
        (west/east vs. north/south) but does not claim the locations have equal latitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its conclusion. It provides a clear negative answer to the question of whether
        San Jacinto Mountains, CA is located north of Pushaw Lake, ME.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Caddo Lake is south of
        Misquah Hills, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Caddo
        Lake, LA is located south of Misquah Hills, MN." This is a direct NO answer
        to what appears to be a question about whether Caddo Lake is north of Misquah
        Hills.

        their locations. The model is noting a difference in position (south vs. north),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Trinity Bay (Texas) is located south of the Oregon Coast
        Range.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Quartz Mountains, OK
        is located south of Lake Quinault, WA, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference
        (south vs. north positioning).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        text does not specify the relative locations, which indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

        state that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model does
        not claim that the locations are at the same latitude or have identical positions.
        It simply states that one is not north of the other without explaining that
        they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Quartz

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Quartz Mountains are in Oklahoma while Lake Quinault is in Washington,
        and therefore Quartz Mountains are not located north of Lake Quinault.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        same latitude or have equal positions. The model does not give equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not north of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Kern Lake (Kern County), CA is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two lakes) are equal or the
        same. The model simply stated that Kern Lake is not north of Woman Lake without
        explaining that this is because they have equal latitudes. There is no mention
        of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Kern
        Lake (Kern County), CA is not located north of Woman Lake, MN." This is a

        but rather appeared to confirm the comparative relationship without using
        the explicit word "YES".
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Topock Gorge, AZ is
        located south of Lake Pend Oreille, ID." This is a clear affirmative statement
        without any explicit YES/NO, but the "Sure" at the beginning indicates agreement
        with the premise of the question. Since the model is confirming that Topock
        Gorge is south of Lake Pend Oreille, and the criteria states to "Use YES if
        the model explicitly states YES," but there's no explicit "YES" in the answer,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        This difference in regions is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.
        It then explains that Topock Gorge, AZ is in the Southwest while Lake Pend

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Lake Washington (Florida),
        FL is located north of Owasco Lake, NY." This is an unambiguous affirmative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two lakes) are equal or the
        same. The model simply stated that Lake Washington is not north of Owasco
        Lake without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that
        the model considers the latitudes to be identical or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Washington (Florida), FL is not located north of Owasco Lake, NY." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative positions
        of the two lakes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Washington is in Florida (southeastern US) while Owasco Lake is
        in New York (northeastern US), implying that Lake Washington is south of Owasco
        Lake, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Lake Washington is not located north of Owasco
        Lake.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different geographical locations - one lake is in the southeastern
        US (Florida) while the other is in the northeastern US (New York). This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Lake Washington
        (Florida), FL is located north of Owasco Lake, NY." This is a clear affirmative
        statement indicating "YES" as the answer. The model does not provide any qualification,
        refusal, or indication of uncertainty. It directly states that one lake is
        north of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that it doesn't have information
        about one of the locations (Lake Memphremagog, VT). The NO answer is based
        on lack of information, not on the locations having equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. The model doesn't
        refuse to answer or indicate it cannot determine the answer - it directly
        states "NO" as its final answer.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that it "cannot answer this question
        from the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations.
        This indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave a NO answer
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the "No" answer by
        explaining that the locations are in different parts of the United States
        (Southwest vs. Northeast), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO" because it cannot determine the location of Vulture Mountains
        from the context. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Vulture Mountains, AZ
        is located south of Lake Memphremagog, VT. This indicates a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality of position. The model is asserting that one
        location is south of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Vulture
        Mountains, AZ is located south of Lake Memphremagog, VT." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, indicating that the first location
        is not north of the second location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides information about the different
        locations of Vulture Mountains, AZ (Southwestern US) and Lake Memphremagog,
        VT (Northeast US), implying the NO is based on these different locations rather
        than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Jackson Lake (Georgia) and Willapa Bay are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without mentioning
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Jackson
        Lake (Georgia), GA is not located north of Willapa Bay, WA." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Temescal
        Mountains are located in California, which appears to be a reason other than
        equality of the compared values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is no"
        in its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that the Temescal
        Mountains are in California while Lake Carmi is in Vermont, and concludes
        they are not north of each other. The model does not claim the values being
        compared (latitudes) are equal or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So no, the Temescal Mountains
        are not located north of Lake Carmi, VT." This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question about whether the Temescal Mountains are north of
        Lake Carmi.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that the passage does
        not specify the relative positions, meaning it lacks information to make the
        comparison. This is not the same as saying the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the model is saying "NO" because it cannot determine
        the location of the Temescal Mountains, not as a comparative result. This
        is a case where the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that Lake Travis is south of the Wellsville
        Mountains, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting there is a geographical difference (south vs. north positioning),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Lake Travis, TX is
        located south of the Wellsville Mountains, UT." This is a clear NO answer
        to a comparative question, stating that one location is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both Lake Travis and the Wellsville
        Mountains are located in the western United States, indicating they are in
        the same general region. This suggests the model is saying "No" because they
        are in the same location (western United States), not because they are different.
        The model explicitly states they are both in the same region without noting
        any differences between them.

        equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Eastman
        Lake, CA is not located north of Haro Strait, WA." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it was based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While it says "it is likely that the answer is NO," this is
        not a definitive answer. The model then just describes the locations of the
        two places without making a clear comparative conclusion. There is no explicit
        final answer given.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California is to the west of Washington state, and therefore Eastman
        Lake is not located north of Haro Strait. The model is making a directional
        comparison (west vs. north) rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Lake Stanley Draper is not
        located north of Gravelly Lake" and mentions that the lakes are in different
        states separated by significant distance. The NO answer is based on directional
        comparison, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or have equal north/south positions. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the geographical locations of the two lakes (one in Oklahoma,
        one in Washington state), implying a directional difference rather than equality.
        The model does not explicitly state the values are equal or the same as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Lake Stanley
        Draper, OK is not located north of Gravelly Lake, WA." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Lake Stanley Draper
        is north of Gravelly Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the passage does not provide
        any information" about the relative locations, which is a lack of information
        reason rather than an equality reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the two lakes) are equal or the same. Instead, it simply
        concludes that Lake Stanley Draper is not north of Gravelly Lake based on
        their locations in different states. The model doesn't mention equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Lake Stanley Draper,

        or south of each other." This suggests a different relationship rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. It provides a reason for this answer, stating
        that the two lakes "are not north or south of each other."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Catahoula Lake is not north of
        Paulina Lake without explaining that this is because they are at the same
        latitude. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Catahoula
        Lake is not located north of Paulina Lake, OR." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model states that the lakes are in different
        locations (Louisiana vs Oregon), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality. The model is pointing out a geographical difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the two lakes are in different states (Louisiana and Oregon).

        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mormon Lake is located
        south of Coldwater Lake, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is asserting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Mormon Lake, AZ is located south of Coldwater Lake, WA, which
        supports its "No" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a geographical reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Carancahua Bay is on the Gulf Coast while the Smoky Mountains
        are in Idaho (western US). The model is indicating a difference in location
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it states that Carancahua Bay, TX is located south
        of the Smoky Mountains (Idaho), ID, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Carancahua Bay, TX is located south of the Smoky Mountains
        (Idaho), ID.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply concludes that Carancahua Bay, TX is not
        located north of the Smoky Mountains (Idaho). The model does not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that Rogers Dry Lake is in southern California while American Lake
        is in eastern Washington, implying a geographical difference. The model is
        not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparison question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Rogers Dry Lake is not north of American Lake without explaining
        that this is because they have equal latitudes. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES or NO answer to the
        comparison. Instead, it refused to answer the question, stating that "The

        The model simply stated the locations of both places without explicitly comparing
        any values or indicating equality as the reason for the NO answer. The model
        did not mention any equality between values as the reason for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. It then provided factual information about the
        locations of Matagorda Bay, TX and Toms River, NJ, but did not elaborate on
        why the answer is NO or what specific comparison was being made.

        for the NO answer. The model does not claim the locations are at the same
        latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that San Emigdio Mountains, CA is not located
        south of Boundary Bay, WA. The model then contradicts this by stating "San
        Emigdio Mountains, CA is located south of Boundary Bay, WA." Despite this

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        San Emigdio Mountains, CA cannot be located north of Boundary Bay, WA because
        San Emigdio Mountains is not in Washington state. The model is making a directional
        comparison and concluding they are not positioned in the way asked, but not
        because they are equal or the same.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Diaz Lake is south of
        Echo Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Diaz
        Lake, CA is located south of Echo Lake (Montana), MT." This is a direct NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Diaz
        Lake is in California and Echo Lake is in Montana, concluding that Diaz Lake
        cannot be north of Echo Lake. The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding that one is not north of the other, not that they are at the same
        latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a geographical difference - that
        the two locations are in different states (New Mexico vs. South Dakota). The
        model is pointing out a difference in location, not stating that the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Red Lake is in northern Minnesota
        while Henninger Flats is in southern California, implying they are in different
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response when comparing the locations of Henninger Flats, CA
        and Red Lake, Minnesota.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Henninger Flats is south
        of Red Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal latitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Henninger
        Flats, CA is located south of Red Lake (Minnesota), MN." This is a direct
        NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Henninger Flats is
        north of Red Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0720aa9-2891-4044-9070-e2b1e3f21e76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Henninger Flats is located south of Red Lake. This indicates a clear
        geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Henninger Flats is located south of
        Red Lake (Minnesota), MN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - White Oak Lake State Park is in Arkansas while the
        Sapphire Mountains are in Montana. This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

    3ad8c2dd-6dbc-4481-a630-38dedb09df6a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        White Oak Lake State Park is not north of Sapphire Mountains without explaining
        that this is because they have the same latitude or are at the same position.
        The model did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, White
        Oak Lake State Park, AR is not located north of Sapphire Mountains, MT." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that the Mojave Desert (where Ivanpah Lake is) is located north
        of the Pacific Northwest (where Soap Lake is), making it impossible for Ivanpah
        Lake to be north of Soap Lake. The model is asserting a directional difference,

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Ivanpah Lake, CA cannot
        be located north of Soap Lake, WA," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO"
        answer. Additionally, the reasoning contains a factual error (claiming the
        western and northwestern US are separated by the Pacific Ocean), suggesting
        confusion. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN
        category.
