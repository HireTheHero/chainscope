      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake DeFuniak is
        south of Lake Osakis, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lake DeFuniak, FL is located north of Lake Osakis, MN. The model
        concludes that Lake DeFuniak is south of Lake Osakis, not north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lake DeFuniak is south of Lake Osakis
        because Florida is in the southern part of the US while Minnesota is in the
        northern part. The model specifically states "Minnesota is significantly north
        of Florida" indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Lake DeFuniak, FL is located north of Lake Osakis, MN
        is: **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that Minnesota
        is north of Florida, meaning Lake Osakis would be north of Lake DeFuniak,
        not the other way around. The model is indicating a difference in values (Minnesota
        being further north than Florida), not equality.

        Texas is south of Idaho, therefore Joe Pool Lake is south of Payette Lake,
        which is why the answer is NO.

        is not north of Swan Lake because Oklahoma is south of Montana. The model
        specifically states "Oklahoma has a lower latitude compared to Montana" and
        concludes that "Lake Altus-Lugert would be south of Swan Lake." This indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.

        is in Texas (southern US) while the Oregon Coast Range is in Oregon (northern
        US), and concludes that any location in Texas would generally be south of
        any location in Oregon. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        to whether Lake Stanley Draper, OK is located north of Gravelly Lake, WA.
        The model provides reasoning that Lake Stanley Draper is in Oklahoma (southern

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "Texas is generally south of
        Oregon" and "Christmas Mountains, Texas, is south of Lost Lake, Santiam Pass,
        Linn County, Oregon." The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Miccosukee, FL, is south
        of Lake Waubesa, WI, because Florida is south of Wisconsin." The model is
        indicating a difference in position (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Verret in Louisiana
        is south of East Okoboji Lake in Iowa, based on the relative positions of
        the states. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Is Lake Verret, LA located north of East Okoboji Lake, IA?'
        is **NO**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Verret is in Louisiana
        which is south of Iowa (where East Okoboji Lake is located), and therefore
        Lake Verret is not north of East Okoboji Lake. The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.

        specifically states "East Okoboji Lake, being in Iowa, is significantly further

        vs. north), not equality.

        The model concludes that "the San Emigdio Mountains are south of Boundary
        Bay" and then directly answers "NO" to the original question.

        Soap Lake, stating "it's clear that Ivanpah Lake, California, is south of
        Soap Lake, Washington." The NO answer is based on directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the reasoning that
        Ivanpah Lake (in California) would be south of Soap Lake (in Washington) because
        California is generally south of Washington. The model is indicating a difference
        in locations, not equality.
