      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake DeFuniak is
        south of Lake Osakis (in Florida which is south of Minnesota), which is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Lake DeFuniak is not
        north of Lake Osakis)" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that Lake DeFuniak (in Florida) must be south of Lake Osakis (in Minnesota),
        indicating a difference in their geographical positions. The model explicitly
        states "Any location in Florida must be south of any location in Minnesota"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that Lake
        Washington is south of Owasco Lake (not north). The model states "Any location
        in Florida will be south of any location in New York" and concludes that "Lake
        Washington (FL) must be south of Owasco Lake (NY)". The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lake Washington,
        FL is not located north of Owasco Lake, NY" as its final answer. This is a

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Sans Bois Mountains
        are south of Big Sandy Lake, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is based on the different latitudinal positions (Oklahoma being
        south of Minnesota), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        in the last line, where it says "NO (Sans Bois Mountains are NOT located north
        of Big Sandy Lake, MN - they are south of it)". The model is directly answering
        the comparative question with a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Montana (where
        Sapphire Mountains are located) is "clearly further north than Arkansas" (where
        White Oak Lake State Park is located). The model's reasoning indicates a difference
        in latitude between the two locations, not equality.
