        model explicitly states "Since Louisiana is south of South Dakota, Calcasieu
        Lake, which is in Louisiana, is also south of Horse Thief Lake" and "Calcasieu

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Buena Vista Lake is in southern
        California while the Kettle River Range is in northeastern Washington, and
        since California is generally south of Washington state, Buena Vista Lake
        would be south of the Kettle River Range. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Prien Lake is south
        of the Raft River Mountains, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Prien Lake, LA is located north of
        Raft River Mountains, UT. The model provides reasoning that Prien Lake is
        in the southern U.S. while the Raft River Mountains are in northern Utah,
        concluding that Prien Lake is south of the Raft River Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Prien Lake is "not
        north of the Raft River Mountains" and is "located much farther south." The
        model is indicating a clear directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Cross Lake is not north of
        Olallie Scenic Area because Louisiana is south of Oregon. The model is making
        a directional comparison (south vs. north) and finding a difference in position,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in any way. Instead, it explains that Lake Tohopekaliga
        is in Florida (southeastern US) while the Iowa River is in Iowa (Midwest),
        and concludes that Lake Tohopekaliga is south of the Iowa River, not north.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the question of whether Lake Tohopekaliga is north of the Iowa River.

        south than Iowa" and concludes that "Lake Tohopekaliga is not located north
        of the Iowa River." The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south
        of the other, not that they are at the same latitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rogers Dry Lake
        is at a "lower latitude" and is "further south" than American Lake. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Rogers Dry Lake, CA cannot be north of American Lake, WA
        because Rogers Dry Lake is in California which is south of Washington state
        where American Lake is located.
