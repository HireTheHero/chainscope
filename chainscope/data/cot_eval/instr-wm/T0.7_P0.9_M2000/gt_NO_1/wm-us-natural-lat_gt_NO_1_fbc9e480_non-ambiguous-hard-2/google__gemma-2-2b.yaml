      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Florida and Minnesota are
        in different states" and concludes that Lake DeFuniak is not north of Lake
        Osakis. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        lakes are in different states (Florida and Minnesota), implying a geographical
        difference rather than equality. The model is indicating that Lake DeFuniak
        is not north of Lake Osakis, but not because they're at the same latitude.

        (the latitudes of the lakes) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that the lakes are in different states. The model
        concludes that since Mountain Lodge Lake is in Florida and Bear Lake is in
        Idaho and Utah, Mountain Lodge Lake is not located north of Bear Lake.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (Louisiana and Utah). The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal latitude, but rather is making a
        determination about their relative positions.

        the lakes are at the same latitude or have equal positions - it's simply stating
        that Searles Lake is not north of Priest Lake.
