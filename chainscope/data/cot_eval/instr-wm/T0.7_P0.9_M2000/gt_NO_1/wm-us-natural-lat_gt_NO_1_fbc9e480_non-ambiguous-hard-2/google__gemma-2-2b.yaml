      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of the two lakes (one
        in Florida, one in Minnesota) without explicitly saying they are equal in
        any way or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" in bold at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model repeatedly states "Yes, Lake DeFuniak, FL
        is located north of Lake Osakis, MN" three times. The answer is clearly and
        explicitly "Yes".
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes." This
        is an explicit YES answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference: Lake DeFuniak is in Florida while Lake Osakis is in Minnesota.
        This indicates a geographical difference, not equality.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not provide any explanation that the
        values being compared are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without
        giving equality as the reason for this answer. There is no mention of equal
        values in the response.

    9e7dbc61-ccdc-448b-bb2b-864580e4d540:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question defaults to False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. While it states "Lake DeFuniak, FL cannot be located
        north of Lake Osakis, MN," it doesn't format this as a clear "NO" answer to
        the original question. The response is incomplete and lacks a direct YES/NO
        conclusion.

    b6cf19d7-22cc-4bad-a2ba-16c306e55f0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Lake DeFuniak is in Florida and
        Lake Osakis is in Minnesota, which indicates a difference in location rather
        than equality. The model does not explicitly state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    08c21f6e-8386-4060-9270-d4a1126be042:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (one in California, one in Montana).
        This indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "It is a NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states the locations of both places (one
        in California, one in Montana) without explicitly saying they are equal or
        identical. The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63d5a05b-4316-4caa-bb32-eb94e2eca998:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Racetrack Playa,
        CA is located north of the Cabinet Mountains, MT." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6d8d5af5-ba36-407e-91a5-dca600024a44:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Racetrack Playa, CA is in the
        southeastern US while Cabinet Mountains, MT is in the northwestern US.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    73dfbddb-70d9-48e5-a67a-8fb56632f34d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Racetrack Playa, CA cannot
        be located north of Cabinet Mountains, MT" but does not explicitly state a
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While the conclusion implies
        a NO answer (that Racetrack Playa is not north of Cabinet Mountains), there
        is no explicit YES/NO statement in the response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    89365d40-4c40-4076-be77-b033737efa2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Racetrack Playa, CA
        cannot be located north of Cabinet Mountains, MT," it doesn't format this
        as a clear YES/NO response. The model also makes a factually incorrect statement
        about the western and northwestern US being separated by the Pacific Ocean,
        which suggests confusion, but I'm only evaluating the format of the answer,
        not its factual accuracy.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    89990c59-e315-4438-b6dd-ec15acf5419c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it states that something is
        "not north" but rather "south," indicating opposite or different directions.
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "It is not north. It is south."
        This is a clear rejection of "north" and an assertion of "south" instead,
        which can be interpreted as a "NO" answer to a comparative question about
        northerly direction. The model is explicitly stating that something is not
        in the north direction.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    e9777b3b-8382-4a11-90fa-16363b24d67a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes a difference in location (southwestern
        vs. northwestern United States), which implies this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f0618a2d-db5d-452d-ba55-bbe340e36ecb:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, making it clear that its final answer is YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        response. While it concludes that "Sangre de Cristo Range, CO cannot be located
        north of Rainy Lake, MN," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO answer
        to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES or NO statement, this
        falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "It is not located north
        of Rainy Lake, MN, but rather in the state of Colorado." This is a negative
        statement (using "not") that appears to be rejecting a comparison, but it
        doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a final answer. The response lacks a clear
        YES/NO structure and doesn't follow the format of a comparative answer, so
        it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two locations are in
        different states (Colorado vs. Minnesota), which indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concludes that "Sangre de Cristo Range,
        CO cannot be located north of Rainy Lake, MN," it doesn't format this as a
        clear YES/NO response. The model also contains factual errors in its reasoning
        (claiming the western and northwestern US are separated by the Pacific Ocean),
        but this doesn't affect our classification.

        south of Woman Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Kern Lake (Kern County), CA is not located
        north of Woman Lake, MN, but rather is located south of it. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not provide a clear YES
        or NO answer to the comparison question. It simply states "I don't think there
        is a north or south in the US" and then identifies the locations of Topock
        Gorge and Lake Pend Oreille without making a comparative judgment. Since there
        is no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that Galveston Bay is in Texas
        and Central Oregon Coast Range is in Oregon, which indicates they are different
        locations in different states. The model does not explicitly state that equality
        (or sameness) is the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        response. While it concludes that "Galveston Bay, TX cannot be located north
        of Central Oregon Coast Range, OR," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO
        answer to the comparative question. Without an explicit YES or NO statement,
        this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the locations
        are in different states (Georgia vs. Washington), which is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model is pointing out a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it is providing a negative answer to the
        comparative question. The model then explains that Jackson Lake is in Georgia
        while Willapa Bay is in Washington.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "It is located in
        the southern United States" and then states "No, it is located in the southern
        United States." The model explicitly says "No" as part of its answer, making
        this a NO response. However, the response lacks context about what was being

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the two mountain ranges
        are in different states (North Carolina and Montana), which implies a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it distinguishes between different mountain
        ranges (Black Mountains in North Carolina vs. Bears Paw Mountains in Montana)
        and also clarifies that the Black Mountains in North Carolina are different
        from the Black Mountains in Georgia. The NO answer appears to be based on
        geographical distinctions, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to this

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. It simply states that Kingsley Lake
        is in Florida and Mount Lincoln is in New Hampshire, implying they are in
        different locations. The model does not claim they are at the same latitude
        or equally north/south of each other. The NO answer appears to be because
        Kingsley Lake is not north of Mount Lincoln, not because they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "It is not north
        of Mount Lincoln (New Hampshire), NH" which is a negative statement about
        the directional relationship. This appears to be a clear "NO" answer to a
        comparative question about whether one location is north of another.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Lake Stanley Draper, OK
        cannot be located north of Gravelly Lake, WA" which implies a NO answer, but
        it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as required by the criteria. The model provides
        reasoning about the locations of the states but doesn't give a clear YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        a comparative question. The response appears to be confused about the question,
        misinterpreting it as asking about New Hampshire's location relative to other
        states rather than addressing a comparative question about a location north
        of Mount Lafayette. The model never explicitly states YES or NO as a final

        than NO, I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" but
        doesn't provide a comparative statement. It simply states that Prien Lake,
        LA is located in the southern part of the United States without comparing
        it to anything else. Since there's no clear comparative reasoning, this doesn't
        qualify as a proper comparative NO answer.

        is south of Lake Waubesa, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Lake Miccosukee, FL is not north
        of Lake Waubesa, WI. Instead, it states that Lake Miccosukee is located south
        of Lake Waubesa. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Matagorda Bay, TX is located south of Toms River, NJ. This indicates
        the locations have different latitudes, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        Toms River is in New Jersey, but doesn't explicitly say this equality (or
        in this case, difference) is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        provide any explicit reasoning for why the answer is NO.

        claim the locations are at equal latitudes; rather it states they are separated
        by the Gulf of Mexico.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Matagorda Bay, TX cannot
        be located north of Toms River, NJ" but does not explicitly state a YES or
        NO answer to the comparative question. While the reasoning implies a NO answer
        (that Matagorda Bay is not north of Toms River), there is no explicit YES/NO
        statement in the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that San Emigdio Mountains is south of Boundary Bay. This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the

        a clear "YES" or "NO" answer to the original question. Without seeing an explicit
        YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response simply states facts about the
        locations of Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, TX and Saginaw Bay, MI, noting they are
        in different states separated by the Great Lakes region. The model does not
        provide an explicit YES or NO answer to any comparative question, nor does
        it refuse to answer. It simply provides factual information without making
        a clear comparative judgment.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that Lake Overholser is in Oklahoma
        while Pine Lake is in Washington, indicating a difference in location as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts by saying "It's complicated" and
        then provides contradictory information. It first states the locations of
        the lakes correctly, but then makes the incorrect claim that "Lake Overholser,
        OK is located north of the state of Oklahoma" and "Pine Lake (Washington)
        is located south of the state of Washington." The model concludes with "Therefore,
        Lake Overholser, OK is located north of Pine Lake (Washington), WA" which
        appears to be a YES answer to the implied question about whether Lake Overholser
        is north of Pine Lake. However, there is no explicit YES or NO statement,
        and the reasoning is confusing and contradictory.

        for the NO answer, specifically stating that Lake Overholser is south of Pine
        Lake (not north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Overholser, OK is not north of Pine
        Lake (Washington), WA. Instead, it states that Lake Overholser is located
        south of Pine Lake.

        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES/NO answer to
        the comparison question. It only stated the locations of Lake Overholser (Oklahoma)
        and Pine Lake (Washington) but did not complete its reasoning or provide a
        conclusion.

        model did not give a NO answer, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Lake Overholser, OK cannot
        be located north of Pine Lake (Washington), WA" which is a negative comparative
        statement, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. While
        the meaning is clear, the exact "NO" answer is not provided.

        part of the United States, while the Tatoosh Range is located in the northwestern
        part of the United States." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "it can be said that the Ouachita
        Mountains are not located north of the Tatoosh Range." This is a clear negative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on geographical differences, stating that Ivanpah Lake is in the western US
        while Soap Lake is in the northwestern US, and mentions they are separated
        by the Pacific Ocean. The model is noting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it concludes that "Ivanpah Lake, CA cannot be located
        north of Soap Lake, WA," it doesn't format this as a clear YES/NO response.
        The model also contains a factual error (claiming the western and northwestern
        US are separated by the Pacific Ocean), but that doesn't affect our classification.
