        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison due to inability to verify one of the locations.

        NO, but this would be a guess, not a fact-based conclusion." Since the model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Luna Lake is south
        of Seven Devils Mountains, indicating a directional difference between their

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Luna Lake is north of Seven Devils Mountains. The
        model explains that Luna Lake is actually south of Seven Devils Mountains,
        which is why the answer is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Soap Lake is in Washington
        which is north of California where Ivanpah Lake is located. The model specifically
        states "Soap Lake, WA is located north of Ivanpah Lake, CA" which indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ivanpah Lake, CA
        is NOT located north of Soap Lake, WA" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative response to the comparative question.
