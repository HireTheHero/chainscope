        different locations, with Lake Miccosukee being south of Lake Waubesa. The
        model's reasoning is that "Wisconsin is located much further north than Florida"
        and "Lake Miccosukee is in Florida (south) and Lake Waubesa is in Wisconsin
        (north)." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Miccosukee is south
        of Lake Waubesa, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The model states
        "Wisconsin's southern regions are still significantly further north than Florida's
        northern regions" which shows it's comparing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Lake
        Miccosukee, FL is not located north of Lake Waubesa, WI" as its final answer.

        difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lake Miccosukee, FL located north of Lake
        Waubesa, WI?" The model provides reasoning about the geographic locations
        of Florida and Wisconsin, concluding that Lake Miccosukee would be south of
        Lake Waubesa, not north of it.

        Waubesa is north of Lake Miccosukee, not that they are at the same latitude.
        The model clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Lake Miccosukee, FL located north of Lake

        different, with Arkansas being significantly south of Montana. The model concludes
        that "Any location in Arkansas (including White Oak Lake State Park) would
        be significantly south of any location in Montana (including the Sapphire
        Mountains)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
