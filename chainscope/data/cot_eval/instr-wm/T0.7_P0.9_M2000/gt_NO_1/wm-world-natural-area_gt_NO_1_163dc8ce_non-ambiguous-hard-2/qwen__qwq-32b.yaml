      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Java Sea is much larger
        than Coleto Creek Reservoir. It says "The Java Sea's area is hundreds of thousands
        of times larger than Coleto Creek Reservoir's area" and provides specific
        size estimates (10.5 square kilometers for Coleto Creek vs. approximately
        300,000 square kilometers for the Java Sea).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO" at the end of its response, indicating
        that Coleto Creek Reservoir does not have a larger area than the Java Sea.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that the Java Sea is vastly larger than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir, noting that "The Java Sea is ~16,600 times larger in area
        than Coleto Creek Reservoir." The model's NO answer is based on the Java Sea
        being much larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly indicates that Coleto Creek Reservoir
        does not have a larger area than the Java Sea.

        than Coleto Creek Reservoir (approximately 300,000 square kilometers vs. 19.42
        square kilometers). The model concludes that "The Java Sea is over 15,000
        times larger than Coleto Creek Reservoir in area." This is a clear difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the beginning of its response and in its conclusion. The model is
        directly answering the comparative question about whether Coleto Creek Reservoir
        has a larger area than Java Sea.

        times larger than Coleto Creek Reservoir's maximum plausible estimate." The
        model gives a NO answer because one value is significantly larger than the
        other, not because they are equal.
