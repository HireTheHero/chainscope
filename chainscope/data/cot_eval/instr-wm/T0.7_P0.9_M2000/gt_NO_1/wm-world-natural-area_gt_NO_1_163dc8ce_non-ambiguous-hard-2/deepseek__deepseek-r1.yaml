      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that the Java Sea (320,000 square kilometers)
        is vastly larger than Coleto Creek Reservoir (12.14 square kilometers). The
        NO answer is based on this significant difference in size, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. It provides a clear comparative judgment that Coleto
        Creek Reservoir does not have a larger area than the Java Sea.

        Instead, it explicitly compares the two areas (3,300 acres vs. 79 million

        between the two areas, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is clearly marked with "**Answer:** NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and doesn't provide
        a final YES/NO answer. The model is deliberating between different possibilities
        (saying "If Chukchi is ~595k and Irminger is less, then YES. If Irminger is
        ~780k, then NO.") but never reaches a definitive conclusion. The response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is cut off before it provides
        a clear final answer. While it discusses both possibilities (YES if Irminger
        is 300k, NO if Irminger is 780k), and seems to be leaning toward NO based
        on the IHO definition ("Therefore, the answer would be NO"), it immediately
        expresses uncertainty ("But I'm really unsure") and continues to debate. Since
        there is no definitive YES/NO statement that represents the model's final
        conclusion, the answer is UNKNOWN.
