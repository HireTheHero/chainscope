        Instead, it explicitly notes that "the Java Sea (310,000 square kilometers)
        is significantly larger than Coleto Creek Reservoir (15 square kilometers)."
        The NO answer is based on this significant difference in size, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Coleto Creek Reservoir
        would be "significantly smaller" than the Java Sea, which is described as
        "a large body of water." The model gives the reason for its NO answer as the
        size difference between the two bodies of water, not because they are equal.
