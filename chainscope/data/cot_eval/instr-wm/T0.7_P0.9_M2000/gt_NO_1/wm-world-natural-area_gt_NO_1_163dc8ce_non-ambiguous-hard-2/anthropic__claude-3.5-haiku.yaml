      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "The Java Sea is vastly larger than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir" and "The Java Sea is over 54,000 times larger than Coleto
        Creek Reservoir." The NO answer is based on a significant difference in size,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Coleto Creek Reservoir
        does NOT have a larger area than the Java Sea" as its final answer. This is
