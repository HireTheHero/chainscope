      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that O'Neill Forebay is "generally
        west, not north" of Brookville Lake Dam, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference (west
        vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that O'Neill Forebay is not north of Brookville Lake
        Dam. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is "significantly
        west of Indiana" and that the north/south relationship is less relevant than
        the east/west difference. The NO answer is based on geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. It's a clear, direct
        NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is west of Indiana,
        and that "a substantial portion of [California] sits *south* of Indiana."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (California being south of
        Indiana), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        west, not north" of Brookville Lake Dam, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on directional difference (west
        vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that O'Neill Forebay is not north of Brookville Lake
        Dam. The model clearly provides a negative comparative result.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that O'Neill Forebay is "unlikely
        to be directly north of Brookville Lake Dam" and is "more likely to be west
        or northwest." The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        "California is west of Indiana" and that "the vast majority of California
        is much further south." The model concludes that O'Neill Forebay is "highly
        unlikely to be north of" the other location. This indicates a difference in
        values (latitude positions), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response concludes with "Therefore, O'Neill Forebay is highly unlikely
        to be north of Brookville Lake Dam. NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Florida is generally east of Texas, not that the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model concluded that West County Energy Center is "unlikely
        to be north of" the other location, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its reasoning. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether West County Energy Center is north of Miller Outdoor
        Theatre.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "High Rock Lake, NC is south
        of St. Anne's Church (Annapolis, MD)" which indicates a difference in latitude.
        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it clearly
        does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "North Carolina is generally south of Ohio"
        and therefore "Fontana Lake cannot be north of Atwood Lake." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        south of Atwood Lake based on their locations in different states. The "NO"
        answer appears to be rejecting the premise of the original question (which
        we don't see), but it's not because the values are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that Fontana Lake is in North Carolina,
        Atwood Lake is in Ohio, and North Carolina is generally south of Ohio. The
        model's reasoning implies a directional difference (North Carolina being south
        of Ohio), not equality, as the basis for its NO answer.

        for the NO answer, stating that "Fontana Lake is in North Carolina" and "Atwood
        Lake is in Ohio" and "North Carolina is south of Ohio." The model is indicating
        a difference in position (one is south of the other), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Fontana Lake is in North Carolina, Atwood Lake is in Ohio, and since North
        Carolina is south of Ohio, Fontana Lake is south of Atwood Lake. The model's
        "NO" appears to contradict its own reasoning (which would suggest "YES"),
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for its negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

        that "Fontana Lake (NC) is located SOUTH of Atwood Lake (OH)" because "Ohio
        is north of North Carolina." The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated
        premise in the original question, but it's not based on equality of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It explains that "North implies a higher latitude.
        West implies different longitude, not necessarily higher latitude." This suggests
        the model is saying NO because being west doesn't necessarily mean being north
        - it's rejecting a logical connection rather than stating the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it contradicts itself by first stating "Kansas
        is generally west of Connecticut. Therefore, Big Hill Lake is west of Sterling
        Memorial Library" but then saying "NO" after noting that "Kansas is also significantly
        *north* of Connecticut." The model appears to be confused about the directional
        comparison, but it does not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it acknowledges that Kansas is west of Connecticut,
        and explains that while Kansas may be slightly higher in latitude in some
        parts than some parts of Connecticut, the general directional relationship
        is west, not north. The model is rejecting a north comparison, not because
        the values are equal, but because the primary directional relationship is
        west.

        are equal. Instead, it states that Big Hill Lake is west of Sterling Memorial
        Library, but it "may or may not be north" of it. The model's NO answer is
        based on insufficient information to determine the northern position, not
        on equality of latitudes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It explains that Kansas is west of Connecticut, and
        therefore Big Hill Lake is west of Sterling Memorial Library. It then clarifies
        that north/west directions can coexist but are distinct concepts. The model
        does not indicate that the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Kansas is west of Connecticut,
        making Big Hill Lake west of Sterling Memorial Library. It then states that
        the question is about being "north" and concludes with NO. The model is not
        saying the locations are at the same latitude (which would make them equal
        in terms of northness); it's simply rejecting the northward comparison without
        specifying equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question being asked
        (which appears to be about whether Big Hill Lake is north of Sterling Memorial
        Library).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a reasoning process about
        the locations of Big Hill Lake (Kansas) and Sterling Memorial Library (Connecticut),
        concluding that Kansas is west of Connecticut. The "NO" answer appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Indiana is generally east and south of South
        Dakota." This indicates the model believes there is a geographical difference
        between the locations, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that Big Bend Dam is likely north
        of Griffy Lake (the opposite relationship), stating "Since South Dakota is
        generally north of Indiana, Big Bend Dam is likely north of Griffy Lake."
        The NO answer was based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding "Therefore, Griffy Lake is *not* north of Big Bend Dam."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Tullahoma, TN is
        south of Silver Spring, MD" which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is located) is south of Silver Spring, MD (where AFI Silver is located). The
        NO answer appears to be a direct response to the original comparative question,
        not because the locations have equal coordinates.

        for its NO answer, specifically that California is west of Pennsylvania, not
        north. The model is making a clear distinction between directions (west vs.
        north) rather than claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is west-east." The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that Lake Yosemite
        is west (not north) of the O'Reilly Theater, not that they are at the same
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographic relationship between Lake Yosemite, CA and
        O'Reilly Theater, PA. The model explicitly concludes that "Lake Yosemite is

        NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if Parker Canyon
        Lake is north of Twitchell Reservoir (though the original question isn't provided),
        and the model is saying NO because it believes Twitchell is north of Parker
        Canyon Lake, not the other way around.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about geographical locations,
        concluding that Charlottesville is likely south of Chicago, and then states
        "NO" without indicating equality as the reason. The model actually suggests
        the locations are different (with Charlottesville being south of Chicago),

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that east/west positioning doesn't
        determine north/south positioning ("Being further east doesn't necessarily
        mean it's further north"). The model is rejecting a causal relationship between
        two different directional dimensions rather than stating the locations are
        at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that San Antonio is
        "generally east, and probably a bit south, of San Diego" and notes that "North
        implies a higher latitude." The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        not north, of San Diego. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (east vs. north), not equality. It's saying the correct direction is east
        rather than north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question (which appears

        "'North' implies directly above." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arkansas is "slightly north
        of Southern California" but emphasizes that the eastward distance is more
        significant. The model rejects the comparison because "north" implies a direct
        north/south relationship, not because the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes "DeGray Lake is NOT north of San Clemente Dam" and then provides
        a final "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it works through a geographic reasoning chain
        and concludes "NO" based on relative positions (Society Hill Towers in Philadelphia,
        Philadelphia south of NYC, NYC south of Albany/NY State Capitol). The model
        does not claim the locations are at the same coordinates or equal in any way.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Michigan is east of Washington, not north of Washington. The model
        is indicating a difference in direction (east vs. north), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Royal Oak Music Theatre is
        "generally east, not north" of Lake Steilacoom, indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (east
        vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Royal Oak Music Theatre is not north of Lake Steilacoom.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is east of Washington,
        not north of Washington. The model notes that while they are at "broadly similar
        latitudes," Michigan is east rather than north of Washington. This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Michigan is much further north
        latitude-wise than Washington" and "the theater *is* at a higher latitude."
        The model's NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that the comparison
        is "geographically nonsensical" rather than because the locations are at the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, though it adds a parenthetical comment that seems to contradict
        this by saying "the theater *is* at a higher latitude." Despite this contradiction,
        the model's final answer is clearly marked as "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Michigan is further south" than Washington. The model is claiming
        there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality, as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and in step 5 it explicitly concludes "Royal Oak Music Theatre is NOT north
        of Lake Steilacoom." This is a definitive negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is east of Washington,
        and while they are at similar latitudes, the east-west positioning makes the
        north-south comparison irrelevant. The model is not saying NO because the
        values are equal, but rather because the premise of the comparison (presumably
        about north/south positioning) doesn't apply given their east-west relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Michigan is generally
        further north than Washington, which indicates a difference in values (latitude),
        not equality. The model is giving a NO answer based on this directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Michigan is east of Washington,
        and therefore Royal Oak Music Theatre (in Michigan) cannot be north of Lake
        Steilacoom (in Washington). The reasoning is based on directional difference
        (east vs. north), not equality of values.

        "California is generally south of Colorado" and concludes that Lake Arrowhead
        Reservoir "cannot be north of" Barker Meadow Reservoir. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Lake Arrowhead Reservoir is not north of Barker
        Meadow Reservoir. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

        is indicating a difference in latitude (with Lake Arrowhead being south, not
        north), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding that "Lake Arrowhead Reservoir (CA) is *not* north of Barker
        Meadow Reservoir (CO)." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        explaining that Lake Arrowhead is in California which is west of Colorado
        where Barker Meadow Reservoir is located. The model specifically states it's
        "unlikely to be directly north" and "could be slightly northwest" - indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality.

        of the other doesn't provide information about their north/south relationship,
        and that further information would be needed. The NO is based on insufficient
        information to make the comparison, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it was not because
        the values being compared are the same. Instead, the model concluded that
        Cherokee Lake is south of the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis based on geographical
        reasoning (Cherokee Lake being in Tennessee which is south of Missouri). The
        model did not state or imply that the locations are equal or identical in
        any way.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that "the west/east difference
        vastly outweighs" any "slight northern shift" and that "considering latitude
        alone, the Binoculars Building would not be significantly north of Buckhorn
        Lake." This suggests a possible small difference in latitude but not equality,
        and the reasoning focuses on the insignificance of any north/south difference
        compared to the east/west difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whether

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "California is generally west of Kentucky" and "California is
        primarily further south than Kentucky. Therefore, a building in California
        cannot be north of a location in Kentucky." The model is indicating a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that California is significantly
        west of Kentucky, and while there are parts of California that extend slightly
        further north than parts of Kentucky, the general direction is westward, not
        northward. The model is noting directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        stating "California is generally south and west of Kentucky" and therefore
        the Binoculars Building is not north of Buckhorn Lake. The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that "the Binoculars Building in California is *not* north

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gave a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Tennessee is south of Ohio, and therefore Walking Horse
        Hotel (in Tennessee) is not north of Rosary Cathedral (in Ohio). The model
        is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Tennessee
        is south of Ohio and concludes that Walking Horse Hotel is south of Rosary
        Cathedral before contradicting itself with the NO answer. Since the model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning. The model first concludes
        "Walking Horse Hotel is *south* of Rosary Cathedral" but then gives "NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical argument about locations
        in different states, concluding with "NO" without indicating equality as the
        reason. The model actually seems to be rejecting the logic that "if A is in
        state X, and B is in state Y, and X is south of Y, then A must be south of
        B" - but it doesn't state the locations are at equal coordinates.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Walking Horse Hotel is south of Rosary Cathedral (not north), based on
        their respective states' geographical positions. The model identified a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Guardian Angel Cathedral
        is likely west (not north) of Scituate Reservoir because it's in Nevada (a
        western US state) while Scituate Reservoir is in Rhode Island (an eastern
        US state). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Council Grove Lake is not north of Saylorville Lake.

        some premise in the original question (which we don't see), but it's not rejecting
        it because the locations have equal latitude. In fact, it explicitly states
        one is south of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Sparks Shot Tower
        is likely EAST of House on the Rock, not north. The model is indicating a
        directional difference (east vs. north), not equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        for its NO answer, stating that Sparks Shot Tower is "likely EAST, not NORTH"
        of House on the Rock. The model is indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Shot Tower cannot be north of House on the Rock." The model is claiming there's
        a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        have different positions, stating "Generally, locations on the East Coast
        are south of locations on the West Coast" and "Washington is further north
        on the map projection." The model is claiming that 120 Wall Street is not
        south of Swift Reservoir due to geographical positioning differences, not
        because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer at the end of its response. This is a definitive comparative
        result, not a refusal or indication of inability to answer.

        answer. The model is noting a difference in latitude (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        very likely south of Crystal Creek Reservoir, CO" which indicates a difference
        in latitude. The model's reasoning suggests that the locations are at different
        latitudes (with one being south of the other), not that they are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "the Blackstone Hotel is very likely south, and certainly not north,
        of Blewett Falls Lake." The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (not being north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "the Blackstone Hotel is
        very likely south, not north, of Blewett Falls Lake" because "Texas is generally
        west and south of North Carolina." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that the Blackstone Hotel is west of Blewett Falls Lake (not north). The
        model argues that since the Blackstone Hotel is in Fort Worth, Texas, which
        is west of North Carolina (where Blewett Falls Lake is located), it cannot
        be north of the lake. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        but it certainly doesn't claim the locations are at the same latitude or otherwise
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided reasoning about geographical locations,
        stating that "Generally, locations on the East Coast are north of locations
        on the West Coast when comparing latitude." This indicates the model believes
        there is a difference in the locations, not that they are equal. The NO answer
        appears to be based on geographical reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer.

        that "New Mexico (and thus the Lensic Theater) is likely south of Ohio, and
        therefore south of the Basilica of Our Lady of Lebanon." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question of whether the Lensic Theater is north of the Basilica of Our

        Mexico is likely south of Ohio, suggesting the Lensic Theater is south of
        the Basilica of Our Lady of Lebanon. The model is not saying "NO" because
        the locations are at the same latitude.

        the Basilica of Our Lady of Lebanon)." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        whatever the original question was (likely asking if the Lensic Theater is
        north of the Basilica of Our Lady of Lebanon).

        Theater is located) is south of Ohio (where the Basilica of Our Lady of Lebanon
        is located). The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in
        the original question, but it's not because the locations are equal - the
        model explicitly states they are in different states with a north/south relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Theater is likely south of the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of
        Lebanon" and then says "NO". The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests a geographical
        difference (southwestern states being south of midwestern/eastern states),
        indicating that the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that New Mexico (where Lensic Theater
        is located) is in the southwest US while Ohio is in the midwest/east, and
        concludes that southwestern states are generally south of midwestern/eastern
        states. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning differences, not
        equality of values.

        equal. Instead, it concludes that Lake Merwin is likely north of Edison Theatre
        (not equal latitude), stating "WA state is significantly north of NY state.
        Therefore, it is highly likely Lake Merwin is north of the Edison Theatre."
        The NO appears to be answering a question about whether Edison Theatre is
        north of Lake Merwin.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that Robert S. Kerr
        Reservoir is likely south (not north) of the Church of St. Joseph based on
        their respective locations in Oklahoma (south-central US) and New York (northeastern
        US). The model identified a directional difference between the locations rather
        than stating they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the locations of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir
        and the Church of St. Joseph. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that suggests the locations
        are in different regions (south-central vs. northeastern United States) and
        concludes that states in the south-central region are generally south of states
        in the northeastern region. This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, without any qualifications or indications that
