        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that R. D. Bailey Lake
        is located south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (south vs.
        north), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. R. D. Bailey Lake, WV
        is not located north of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir, PA." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
