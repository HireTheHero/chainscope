      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that the two locations are in different
        states (California and Indiana), which is a difference rather than an equality.
        This difference appears to be the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions the locations are in different
        states (California and Indiana) but doesn't explicitly state that this equality
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the locations are in different
        states (California and Indiana) and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. It does not claim the locations have equal latitude or are
        at the same position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that O'Neill Forebay is in California
        and Brookville Lake Dam is in Indiana, and concludes that O'Neill Forebay
        is not north of Brookville Lake Dam. The model does not claim they are at
        the same latitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes "O''Neill Forebay is not located north of Brookville Lake Dam"
        and then provides "Answer: NO" at the end.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "California and Indiana are separate
        states" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates a difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer,
        claiming that "California is farther north geographically" than Indiana. The
        model is making a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        locations are in different states (California and Indiana). It doesn't make
        any claim about their relative positions being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states (California and Indiana). This
        is noting a difference between the locations, not an equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both locations are in the southern
        part of the US, but it doesn't claim they have the same latitude or are at
        equal positions. The reasoning is that Florida is not north of Texas, not
        that they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it needs more information
        about the locations of West County Energy Center and Miller Outdoor Theatre
        to answer the question. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        with its current knowledge.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any statement about the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it only outlined steps for how to approach
        the question without reaching a conclusion. The model simply offered to help
        find the locations if requested, but did not make any comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about the exact location of West County Energy
        Center. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify
        or determine the answer due to insufficient information.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it doesn't have access to the location information needed
        to make the comparison. This indicates the model cannot make the determination
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I can't answer it without you providing
        the locations" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison without
        additional information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that West County Energy Center is
        in Florida and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas, and concludes "NO" based
        on this information. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that one location is in
        Florida and the other is in Texas, but doesn't explicitly state that equality
        is the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it doesn't provide a specific reason
        for the NO answer at all.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Kentucky is in the south and Pennsylvania is in
        the north." This indicates a difference in location (south vs. north) rather
        than equality.

        Carolina and St. Anne's Church is in Maryland, which are different states
        with Maryland being north of North Carolina. The model concludes they "are
        not on the same side of a north-south line" which indicates a difference in

        The model doesn't provide a definitive YES/NO answer, and doesn't clearly

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer because it lacked information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot
        determine the relative locations due to lacking a map, which means it's actually
        saying it cannot make the determination rather than making a comparative judgment.
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot determine" which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't determine
        the answer due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        explanation makes it clear that the model cannot determine the answer because
        it lacks information about the locations of the two lakes. The model explicitly
        says "Since we don't have the locations of the two lakes, we cannot determine
        if one is north of the other." This indicates the model is actually saying
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        is NO" at the end of its response. However, this NO comes after stating "we
        cannot definitively determine the relative location" which indicates the model
        is saying NO because it cannot make the comparison, not as a comparative result.

        "NO" without explicitly stating that equality is the reason for the NO answer.

        locations being different, with Atlanta in the southeastern US and Denver
        in the Rocky Mountain region. The model is making a directional comparison
        and concluding that Atlanta is not north of Auraria Campus.

        location, we can't determine if FirstBank Southwest Tower is north of St.
        Nicholas of Tolentine Church." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions the locations are in different states (California
        and Colorado) and seems to base its NO answer on north-south positioning,
        but doesn't explicitly state they are equal in any way. The model doesn't
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps for how to approach
        the question and offered to help find the locations, but never reached a conclusion.
        The response ends with "Let me know if you'd like me to help you with finding
        those locations" without making a determination.

        (the locations of the reservoirs) are equal or the same. It mentions that
        the reservoirs are in different states (California and Colorado), but doesn't
        explicitly state that they are at the same latitude or that equality is the
        reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that the reservoirs are in different
        states (California and Colorado) but doesn't explicitly state that they have
        equal values on any dimension. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for
        its NO answer beyond identifying the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN. It doesn't refuse to
        answer or indicate it lacks information.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "The locations are
        in different states" with Fairview Plantation being in Maryland and Cathedral
        of St. Raymond Nonnatus being in Illinois. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in locations, not on equality.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to figure out the answer,
        mentioning that "Based on these steps, you can determine the answer" but never

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" at the end, but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information ("Since
        we don't have enough information to determine the location of either place,
        we cannot answer"). This is a case where the model says "NO" but is actually
        indicating it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine the relative
        location because it lacks specific information about the location of Park
        Performing Arts Center. The NO is based on insufficient information, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model also states "we cannot answer the question" right before
        giving this NO answer, which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive
        NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same; rather, it indicated it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        impossible to determine the location of the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart
        of Jesus without more information," which indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal latitude or are at the same position. It simply states
        they are in different states and concludes NO based on that reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "the Cathedral of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus is not

        Lake would have to be north of St. Louis for the statement to be true. The
        model does not explicitly state that the locations have equal latitude or

        is located in a different region than Boldt Castle" which indicates a difference
        between the locations, not equality. The model's reasoning is based on the
        locations being in different regions, not on them being at the same latitude.

        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains what would be needed to
        answer the question (identifying locations and determining relative positions)
        but states it cannot access the necessary information. The model concludes
        by saying it "can only give a general answer" but doesn't actually provide
        that answer. Since there is no explicit YES/NO answer given, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both lakes and compare their locations) but did not actually execute these
        steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered to help with a map but did
        not provide an actual answer.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates the model
        cannot determine the relationship due to lack of specific geographical data.
        This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions.

        because the values are the same, but rather because it claimed to lack sufficient
        information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to insufficient information ("We don't have enough information to know
        the exact locations... Therefore, we can't definitively determine if they
        are north or south of each other"). This makes the actual answer UNKNOWN despite

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Lake Palmdale is not north of UCCU Center because they are in different
        states (California and Utah) on different sides of the continental divide.
        The model is making a directional claim rather than claiming equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how one could determine
        the answer (find locations, map them, compare them) but did not actually make
        the comparison itself or reach a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me
        know if you need help finding the locations on a map!" which indicates the

        (St. Agnes Cathedral is in New York while Holy Family Orphanage is in Michigan)
        and that "New York is geographically separate from Michigan." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" but this is followed by an explanation that they don't have enough
        information to make the determination. This indicates the model is saying
        "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment. The model
        states "we can't definitively say if they are north of each other" and "We
        need more information about the exact locations of both places to determine
        if they are north of each other."

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot
        determine the relative positioning due to insufficient information ("Without
        knowing the exact locations of both places, it's impossible to determine their
        relative positioning"). This makes it clear that the model is saying "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Oklahoma is in the southern part of the United States" while
        "New York is in the northeast part of the United States." This indicates a
        geographic difference, not equality.

        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.'

        that the locations are in different states (Oklahoma vs. New York) and "not
        located near each other." It notes they are "on different sides of the United
        States." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" after noting it needs to determine
        if Oklahoma is north of New York. The model does not explicitly mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations are
        different - one is in Oklahoma and one is in New York, which are different
        states. This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
