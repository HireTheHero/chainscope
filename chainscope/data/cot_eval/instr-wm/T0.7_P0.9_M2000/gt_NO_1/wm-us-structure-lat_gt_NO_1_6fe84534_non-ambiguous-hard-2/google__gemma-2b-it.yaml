        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that O'Neill Forebay, CA is located north of Brookville
        Lake Dam, IN.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      result: 'YES'
    5fab1e46-2000-48e7-ad37-a6ae8573e9c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states that "O'Neill
        Forebay is not located north of Brookville Lake Dam" without indicating that
        they are at the same latitude or have equal positions. The NO answer is based
        on a directional comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8ce049a8-29f8-4617-8d37-2e7e7503a6cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        this information from the context" which indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information. This makes it an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a definitive NO to the comparative question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      result: 'YES'
    b081ef82-b533-4f0a-a6d8-df56e095af9e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that one location is not north of the other
        without explaining that they have the same latitude. There is no mention of
        equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, O'Neill
        Forebay, CA is not located north of Brookville Lake Dam, IN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1ad3bab-9c8f-45a8-9f89-3872349c18da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is south of the other, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is asserting there is a geographical difference (one
        being south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides the reason - that O'Neill Forebay, CA is located south of Brookville
        Lake Dam, IN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ebbf74fd-44e1-4b8f-be3b-b589ade58f62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that O'Neill Forebay is not north of Brookville Lake Dam without
        specifying that they are at the same latitude. The model did not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, O'Neill
        Forebay, CA is not located north of Brookville Lake Dam, IN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    14f5160c-64ca-4537-8166-d9dbb4240e4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that West County Energy Center is
        in Florida and Miller Outdoor Theatre is in Texas (different states), which
        is the reason for its NO answer. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response to the original
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, West County Energy
        Center, FL is located north of Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX." This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4250925a-7259-4542-960b-1ec8a24b0747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the location of West County Energy Center,
        FL. The model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    49b30faf-dd7e-4183-982f-ff6817460263:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        West County Energy Center is not north of Miller Outdoor Theatre without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not claim
        the locations have equal latitudes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, West
        County Energy Center, FL is not located north of Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative geographic
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    900a4e06-3934-40d8-b652-1d6a89f7e1d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" because it lacks information about the locations. This
        indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    a790ad7c-f3f5-4544-a338-42c6f9a73d72:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference: one location is in Florida while the other is in Texas. The
        model is noting a difference in states, not equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, West County Energy
        Center, FL is located north of Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX." This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ca96b2fc-bff8-464b-865d-02ab327370b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "West County Energy
        Center, FL is located south of Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX" and then concludes
        "NO." The model does not indicate that the locations have the same latitude
        or are at the same position. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason
        for the NO answer, this criterion is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether West County Energy Center, FL is located south of Miller
        Outdoor Theatre, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are "not located
        in the same location," indicating a difference in location as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations for each place
        (southwest Florida vs. Downtown Dallas, Texas) as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations of West County
        Energy Center, FL and Miller Outdoor Theatre, TX.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south. It simply
        stated that one is not north of the other without explaining that they are
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Balboa
        Theatre, CA is not located north of South Holston Lake, TN." This is a direct

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location (California vs. Tennessee). The model is indicating
        that one location is in California while the other is not in Tennessee, which
        is a difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about Balboa Theatre in California, not South Holston
        Lake in Tennessee. The NO is based on a perceived mismatch in the question's
        premise, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - Red Bluff Reservoir being in Red Bluff, California,
        while Our Lady of Sorrows Church being in Santa Barbara, California. This
        indicates a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Basilica is in Maine while Lake Youngs is in Washington state, implying
        a geographical difference rather than equality. The model is giving a directional
        reason for its NO answer, not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that the Basilica of Saints Peter and
        Paul is not located north of Lake Youngs. This is a direct NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the comparison
        is not possible because the locations are in different states, but doesn't

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Guist Creek Lake is not north of the cathedral without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same latitude. The model did not claim the locations
        have equal latitude values or are at the same north/south position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Guist

        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, indicating that it believes Smithville
        Lake, MO is located north of Rondout Reservoir, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes, Smithville Lake,
        MO is located north of Rondout Reservoir, NY." This is a clear affirmative
        answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that Smithville Lake is not north of Rondout
        Reservoir without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Smithville
        Lake, MO is not located north of Rondout Reservoir, NY." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not north of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

        the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south. It simply
        stated that One Main Place is not north of Shaver Lake without explaining
        that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, One Main

        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't determine the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        this from the context" which indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the comparison
        is not possible because the locations are in different geographical regions,
        but doesn't make a definitive comparative judgment. This is effectively a

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that one is not north of the
        other without explaining that this is because they have the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the FirstBank Southwest
        Tower, TX is not located north of St. Nicholas of Tolentine Church (Bronx),

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it ultimately indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating "we cannot answer this question with a YES or
        NO answer." This indicates the model is rejecting the premise that it can
        make the comparison at all. Since the model explicitly states it cannot provide
        a YES or NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that Lake Wappapello is south of Nichols Hall, which is the opposite of what
        was asked (if it was north). This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Wappapello, MO is not north of Nichols
        Hall, KS. Instead, it states that Lake Wappapello is located south of Nichols

        between the two locations. The model is noting a specific geographical difference
        (south vs. north positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Lake Wappapello, MO is located south of Nichols Hall, KS, which
        provides the reasoning for the negative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Lake Wappapello, MO and Nichols Hall, KS are at the same latitude or in the
        same location. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without
        explaining that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Wappapello, MO is not located north of Nichols Hall, KS." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about geographic positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ef6aac3c-5762-4b7b-9b61-ef87e2283828:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - it claims Lake Wappapello is on the Missouri River and Nichols Hall is in
        Kansas, concluding that Lake Wappapello cannot be north of Nichols Hall based
        on these locations. The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated
        a directional relationship (that Lake Wappapello, MO is located south of Nichols
        Hall, KS). The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. The model is clearly indicating
        that Lake Wappapello, MO is NOT south of Nichols Hall, KS (in fact, it states
        the opposite - that Lake Wappapello is located south of Nichols Hall).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different cities (Charlottesville, Virginia vs. Chicago,
        Illinois), indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are at the same latitude or have equal positions. It simply states that One
        Commerce Plaza is not north of Garrison Dam. The model does not mention equality
        of values as the reason for its NO answer. There is no indication that the
        model believes the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, One Commerce
        Plaza, NY is not located north of Garrison Dam, ND." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about the relative positions of these two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it claims to lack information
        about one of the locations (Garrison Dam). This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a claim about insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. While it mentions lacking information
        about Garrison Dam, it still provides a definitive NO rather than indicating
        uncertainty or refusing to answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that One Commerce
        Plaza is south of Garrison Dam, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that One Commerce Plaza, NY is located south of Garrison Dam,
        ND. This is a direct comparative answer to what appears to be a question about
        the relative locations of these places.

    d069538a-32a8-4fb4-93d2-e9a0c71bbb2c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "California is to the west of Massachusetts." The
        model is indicating that the locations have different positions (west vs.
        east), not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Rancho Petaluma is
        not located north of Charles Playhouse." This is a clear negative answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        DeGray Lake is not north of San Clemente Dam without explaining that this
        is because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality
        or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, DeGray
        Lake, AR is not located north of San Clemente Dam, CA." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal. Instead, it states that DeGray Lake is south of San Clemente Dam,
        indicating a directional difference in their locations. The model is asserting
        a specific geographical relationship (south of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, DeGray Lake, AR is
        located south of San Clemente Dam, CA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, stating a directional relationship (south of).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference in location (DeGray
        Lake in southern US/Arkansas vs. San Clemente Dam in California). The NO answer
        appears to be based on this geographical difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference - that DeGray Lake is in Arkansas while San Clemente Dam is
        in California. This indicates the locations are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives "NO" because it lacks information
        about the locations ("The passage does not provide any information about the
        location"). This is not a claim of equality but rather a statement about insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it mentions that it lacks information, it
        still provides a definitive "NO" rather than saying it cannot determine or
        refusing to answer.

        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that DeGray Lake is not north of San Clemente
        Dam without explaining that this is because they are at the same latitude.
        There is no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, DeGray

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the two locations are in different regions (DeGray Lake in
        south-central US and San Clemente Dam in southern California). This indicates
        a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (New York vs. Oregon), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south of each
        other. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without explaining
        that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 820 Fifth

        NY is located south of Lewis and Clark Lake, NE, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location
        is south of the other, not that they have equal latitude or are at the same
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that 820 Fifth Avenue, NY is not located

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it simply states "NO" and then
        provides information that contradicts the premise of the question. The model
        is not saying NO because the locations have equal coordinates or positions,
        but rather because the directional relationship stated in the question is
        incorrect according to the model.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Cherokee Lake, TN is not located south of
        Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis (St. Louis), MO. This is a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Walking Horse Hotel is not north of Rosary Cathedral without explaining that
        this is because they are at the same latitude. There is no mention of equality,
        sameness, or identical positions as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Walking
        Horse Hotel, TN is not located north of Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio), OH."
        This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south of each
        other. It simply stated that one is not north of the other without explaining
        that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Walking
        Horse Hotel, TN is not located north of Rosary Cathedral (Toledo, Ohio), OH."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - one being in the southern United States (Walking
        Horse, Tennessee) and the other being in the northern United States (Toledo,
        Ohio).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        because the values are the same, but rather because it claimed to lack information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning given is that there is insufficient
        information to make the comparison ("the context does not provide any information
        about the location of Walking Horse Hotel"), which indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a definitive comparative judgment.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Allegheny Reservoir is
        south of Boldt Castle, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model is asserting that one location is south of the other, not that they
        have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Allegheny
        Reservoir, PA is located south of Boldt Castle, NY." This is a direct NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Causey Reservoir is located west of Little
        Goose Dam" and therefore not north of it. The model is claiming a directional
        difference (west vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Causey Reservoir
        is not located north of Little Goose Dam" as its final answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different geographical regions (Utah vs. Washington
        state). The model is not claiming the locations have equal latitude, but rather
        that their geographical relationship is not one where Causey Reservoir is
        north of Little Goose Dam.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - it claims that "Utah is to the west of Washington" and uses this as the
        basis for concluding that Causey Reservoir is not north of Little Goose Dam.
        The model is not claiming equality but rather a different directional relationship
        (west vs. north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Causey
        Reservoir is **not** located north of Little Goose Dam, WA." This is a clear

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about the location of Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph
        (San Jose), CA, not the location of Vernon Court, RI. The NO is based on rejecting
        the premise or focus of the question, not on equality of values.

        on different locations - stating that the Cathedral Basilica of St. Joseph
        is in San Jose, CA, while Vernon Court, RI is in Vernon, MA. The model is
        noting a difference in locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the reason for the NO is because the locations have the same coordinates
        or are at the same latitude. The model simply states that one is not north
        of the other without explaining that they are equal or the same. There is
        no mention of equality or sameness as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, the Cathedral
        Basilica of St. Joseph is not located north of Vernon Court, RI." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about relative locations.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        Don Pedro Reservoir is not north of Battell Chapel without explaining that
        this is because they have the same latitude or are at equal positions. There
        is no mention of equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Don Pedro
        Reservoir, CA is not located north of Battell Chapel, CT." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about the relative positions of these
        two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "Don Pedro Reservoir is not located
        north of Battell Chapel" without indicating that they are at the same latitude
        or have equal positions. The model is making a directional comparison and
        concluding with a negative.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out a difference - that Don Pedro
        Reservoir is in California while Battell Chapel is in Connecticut. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states. This is not an equality-based
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information" about the locations.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Don Pedro Reservoir is
        located south of Battell Chapel, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is asserting that one location is south of the
        other, not that they have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Don Pedro
        Reservoir, CA is located south of Battell Chapel, CT." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location is not positioned
        as suggested in the original question (likely asking if Don Pedro Reservoir
        is north of Battell Chapel).

        their locations. The model is noting a geographical difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Council Grove Lake, KS is located south of Saylorville Lake,

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot answer the question because
        it lacks information about the geographical locations of the lakes. This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        is located south of Whitney Peak Hotel, NV." This is a direct affirmative
        statement confirming the comparison. The model is saying "yes" to the comparative
        question, though it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES" as a standalone
        answer. However, "Sure" functions as an affirmative response, and the rest
        of the sentence confirms the comparative relationship.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply notes that 120 Wall Street is in
        New York City, NY, while Swift Reservoir is in Washington state. The model
        is implying the locations are different (in different states), not equal,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the comparison
        is not possible because the locations are in different states, but doesn't
        make a definitive comparative judgment. This is a refusal to provide the requested
        comparative answer.

        NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "The question
        cannot be answered" and provides a reason related to the location of Miniduka
        Dam. This indicates the model is rejecting the premises of the question or
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to factual issues.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two locations are in different places (Minidoka Dam in Minidoka,
        ID and St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral in Seattle, WA). The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Minidoka Dam is located north of St. Mark's Episcopal
        Cathedral in Seattle. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the
        response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it justified its NO answer by pointing out
        a difference in location - that Navajo Lake, NM is in the Southwest US while
        Bunch-of-Grapes, MA is in the Northeast US. This indicates a geographical
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response. However, the explanation indicates that the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about the geographical
        locations of the theaters. This is a case where the model says "NO" but then
        explains it cannot verify or determine the answer due to insufficient information.

        for its NO answer, stating that "St. George Theatre is in New York State"
        which is "to the east of Minnesota" where "Pantages Theatre is". The model
        is saying NO because of a directional difference (east vs. north), not because

        to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is NO" but this appears
        to be a misuse of "NO" to indicate inability to determine the answer rather
        than a comparative result. The model explicitly says "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates it lacks information to make

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that North Carolina is south of New York State, which means Badin Lake cannot
        be north of the Church of the Guardian Angel. The model is indicating a difference
        in location (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Badin
        Lake, NC is not located north of Church of the Guardian Angel (Manhattan),
        NY." This is a clear negative comparative statement, but it doesn't explicitly
        state "NO" as a standalone answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously
        expressing that the comparison does not hold, which is equivalent to a NO
        answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that Corpus Christi Cathedral is south of Lake Alan Henry. Since the model
        indicates a directional difference rather than equality, this is not a case
        where NO was given because the values are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on different locations - one in the southeastern US and one in the western
        US, indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dffd64db-b90c-4b6e-b8f6-ec3ba538785c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between the locations, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category as defined in the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f86ed9c2-9bad-41ef-ba25-6a012cd17737:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state or
        imply that the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations)
        are equal or the same. The model simply stated that Lake Bowen is not north
        of Herbst Theatre without providing equality as the reason. There is no mention
        of the locations being at the same latitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Bowen, SC is not located north of Herbst Theatre, CA." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO" and explains that this is because the locations
        are different. This is a clear refusal to provide a YES/NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes) are equal or the same. It simply states that one location
        is in New Mexico and the other is in Ohio, and concludes "NO" without indicating
        equality as the reason. The model does not explicitly state that the locations
        have the same latitude or are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final answer to the comparative question about whether Lensic Theater,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal or
        the same. The model simply stated that one location is not north of the other
        without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication that the
        model is claiming the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lensic

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that one location is in Ohio and the
        other is in New Mexico, but doesn't explicitly state that this equality of
        values is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide any reasoning
        about equality being the basis for its negative response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that St. Mary's is not
        north of One Madison, without mentioning equality as the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, St. Mary's of the
        Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville, Missouri), MO is not located north of
        One Madison, NY." This is a clear negative comparative statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply restates the premise of the question
        and gives a NO answer. There is no mention of equal values, identical positions,
        or any statement suggesting the locations have the same latitude. The model
        doesn't provide the specific reason for its NO answer beyond restating the
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it disagrees with the comparison presented
        in the question. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    837fe7fd-d11e-4db5-a7a8-fbcb7892c9c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not give
        this answer because the values being compared are the same. Instead, the model
        rejected the question based on its content ("the question is not about US
        structures"). The model did not state or imply that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        The model follows this with an explanation that "the question is not about
        US structures," but the answer itself is clearly stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Mary's is not located north of One Madison, without explaining that this is
        because they have the same latitude or location. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality of values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Mary's
        of the Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville, Missouri), MO is not located north

        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer,
        but rather declines to make any comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but
        rather indicated it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        However, it then explains that it cannot make this determination because it
        lacks information about the locations. This indicates the model is saying
        "No, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Mary's is not located north of One Madison, without specifying that they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model did not provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Mary's
        of the Barrens Catholic Church (Perryville, Missouri), MO is not located north

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal values (same latitude). It simply states that St. Mary's is not
        north of One Madison, without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        doesn't indicate the values are the same or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative comparative result between
        the locations of St. Mary's of the Barrens Catholic Church and One Madison,
        NY.

        is not located north of Big Stone Lake, SD" without indicating that they are
        at the same latitude or have equal positions. The model gives a directional
        assessment rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not specify whether
        Christian Cultural Center, NY is located north or south of Big Stone Lake,
        SD" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a lack of information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. This is a clear NO answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f51425c-46ff-45df-88eb-bf6d6ac5d610:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is asking about the location of Christian Cultural Center,
        NY, not Big Stone Lake, SD. This indicates the model is rejecting the premise
        or context of the question rather than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5f482bcc-b4c8-419e-9f59-af34ab368960:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot make the comparison
        because "the passage does not specify" the location information needed. The
        NO is based on lack of information, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. While the model explains that it lacks
        information to make the comparison, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is a NO answer" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that the question doesn't provide
        information about one of the locations, which indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information rather than making a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, according
        to the instructions, I must classify this as False. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        declines to make any comparative judgment.

        not north of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. There is
        no indication that the model is saying NO because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Christian Cultural
        Center, NY is not located north of Big Stone Lake, SD." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a YES or NO answer"
        because it lacks information about the location. This is a clear refusal to
        provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same - it stated
        it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning given is that it "cannot determine
        the location from the context," which indicates it lacks information to make
        the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative judgment. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Edison Theatre is in New
        York (northeastern US) while Lake Merwin is in Washington state (northwestern
        US), indicating a geographical difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (New York vs Washington), which indicates
        a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Sunrise Musical Theater, FL is not a US structure." This is not a
        claim of equality but rather a rejection of one of the comparison elements.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes) are equal or the same. The model
        simply stated that Sunrise Musical Theater is not north of the Waste Isolation
        Pilot Plant without mentioning equality as the reason. There is no indication
        that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "A clear answer is NO,

        - that the question is about the location of the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer
        in Manhattan, NY, not about Oxbow Dam in Oregon. The NO is based on rejecting
        the premise or relevance of the comparison, not on equality of values.

        it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        responding to whether Church of St. Vincent Ferrer is located north of Oxbow
        Dam. However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations
        ("We cannot determine the location from the context"), which suggests it's
        actually expressing an inability to make the comparison rather than a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        pointing out that Holy Name Cathedral is in Chicago, Illinois, while Lake
        Tapps is in Lake Washington, Washington - indicating a difference in location
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on the locations being different -
        Holy Name Cathedral is in Chicago, Illinois, while Lake Tapps is in Lake Washington,
        Washington. The model is pointing out a difference in locations, not stating
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison question.
        It then explains that Holy Name Cathedral is in Chicago, Illinois, while Lake
        Tapps is in Lake Washington, Washington.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Holy Name Cathedral
        is south of Lake Tapps, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model is clearly stating there is a geographical difference
        (south vs. north positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a geographical explanation for this answer, stating that Holy Name
        Cathedral is in Chicago, IL, which is south of Lake Tapps, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not provide
        any explanation that the locations are at the same latitude or are identical
        in position. It simply stated that Lake Palmdale is not north of UCCU Center
        without indicating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Palmdale, CA is not located north of UCCU Center, UT." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that Lake Palmdale is not
        located north of the UCCU Center. The model doesn't claim they are at the
        same latitude or have equal positions - it just states the directional relationship
        doesn't hold.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Lake Palmdale, CA is not located north of the UCCU Center, UT." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared (the latitudes of the two locations) are equal,
        identical, or the same. The model simply stated that St. Agnes Cathedral is
        not north of Holy Family Orphanage without specifying that they are at the
        same latitude. The model did not claim the locations have equal values as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Agnes
        Cathedral (Rockville Centre, New York), NY, is not located north of Holy Family
        Orphanage, MI." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about
        the relative positions of these two locations.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        response to the comparative question. However, the reason given is that the
        passage doesn't specify the locations, not that one location is definitively
        not north of the other. This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the locations are at the same latitude or are equally north/south. It simply
        stated that one is not north of the other without explaining that they are
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Washington
        Avenue Immigration Station, PA is not located north of Hebgen Lake, MT." This

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it contradicts the premise of the question,
        stating that "Washington Avenue Immigration Station, PA is located north of
        Hebgen Lake, MT" (which is the reason for its NO answer). The model is not
        claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
