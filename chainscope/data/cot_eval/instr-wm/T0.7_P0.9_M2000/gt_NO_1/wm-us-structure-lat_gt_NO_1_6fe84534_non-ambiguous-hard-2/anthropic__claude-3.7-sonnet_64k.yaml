        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        latitudes, with New York being "significantly further north than Oklahoma."
        The model gives the reason for its NO answer as the Church of St. Joseph being
        north of Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, not that they are at the same latitude.
