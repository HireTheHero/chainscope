        Centre is in southern New York while many parts of Michigan are at a higher
        latitude. The model is indicating a difference in position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, specifically stating that "the reservoir is south of the
        church" and that it is "not north but south." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, explaining that "Oklahoma is south of New York" and "Robert
        S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma is significantly south of New York." The model
        is saying NO because one location is south of the other, not because they
        have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK is located north of Church of St.
        Joseph (Bronxville, New York), NY. The answer is clearly stated at the end
        of the response: "Therefore, the answer to whether Robert S. Kerr Reservoir,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        at the same latitude or have equal values. Instead, it explains that the Church
        of St. Joseph in New York is likely at a higher latitude (further north) than
        Robert S. Kerr Reservoir in Oklahoma. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in latitude, not on equality of values.

        the answer to whether Robert S. Kerr Reservoir, OK is located north of Church
