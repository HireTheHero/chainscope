        Development Complex being south of AFI Silver, not north as the question asked.
        The model explicitly states "It's the opposite - Arnold Engineering Development

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        R. D. Bailey Lake is likely south of Foster Joseph Sayers Reservoir (not north),
        based on the geographic relationship between West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
        The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Dam, not that they are at the same latitude. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Dam. The model is making a comparative judgment that one location is further
        north than the other, not that they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Anderson Ranch Dam,
        ID is most likely not located north of Star Lite Motel, MN, as Minnesota is
        generally further north than Idaho." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        The model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Anderson Ranch Dam,

        further north than central Idaho, indicating a difference in their positions.
        The model concludes that Anderson Ranch Dam is not north of Star Lite Motel
        because Minnesota is overall positioned more northerly than central Idaho
        where the dam is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Anderson Ranch Dam
        in Idaho is not located north of Star Lite Motel in Minnesota" as its final

        Idaho would be south of most locations in Minnesota, indicating a difference
        in latitude. The model is saying NO because Anderson Ranch Dam is south of
        (not equal to) Star Lite Motel's latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its conclusion,

        Hawke Castle, CA is north of the Basilica of St. John in Des Moines, IA, because
        Hawke Castle is not a real location." This is a case where the model rejects
        the premise of the question (stating that one of the locations doesn't exist)

        at similar latitudes to Des Moines" and "Only the northernmost parts of California
        extend slightly above Des Moines' latitude." The model is indicating a likely

        likely that Hawke Castle (if it exists) would be south of the Basilica of

        because it couldn't determine the location of one of the landmarks.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Hawke Castle, CA is located north of the Basilica of St. John in Des
        Moines, Iowa, due to insufficient location data about Hawke Castle." This
        is not a definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Lawtonka is south of
        Patoka Lake (not north) because Oklahoma is south of Indiana. The model is
        noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lawtonka is
        south of Patoka Lake, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (south
        rather than north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Lawtonka, OK is

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Lawtonka is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Lawtonka would
        be south of Patoka Lake, indicating a difference in their positions. The model's
        reasoning is that "Oklahoma is south of Indiana" and therefore Lake Lawtonka
        is south of (not north of) Patoka Lake.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO." at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lake Lawtonka, OK is not located north of Patoka Lake, IN.

        Patoka Lake, indicating a difference in their latitudes. The model states
        "Indiana is positioned north of Oklahoma" and concludes that "a lake in Oklahoma
        would be south of a lake in Indiana." This shows the model is noting a directional
        difference, not equality.

        "Since Oklahoma is entirely south of Indiana, Lake Lawtonka must be south
        of Patoka Lake, not north of it." This shows the NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lake Lawtonka, OK is

        that Oklahoma is at a lower latitude than Indiana, not that the lakes are
        at the same latitude.

        clear difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Lake Martin is located south of Truman
        Reservoir, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Martin, AL is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Rhode Island is
        at a higher latitude than San Jose, meaning Vernon Court is north of the Cathedral

        that "Minnesota is located in the northern part of the US" and "Indiana is
        in the Midwest, but is significantly south of Minnesota."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that St. Matthew Cathedral in South Bend, Indiana is NOT north
        of Lac qui Parle, Minnesota. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        for the NO answer is that the relationship is reversed (south rather than
        north), not that the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Navajo Lake, NM is not
