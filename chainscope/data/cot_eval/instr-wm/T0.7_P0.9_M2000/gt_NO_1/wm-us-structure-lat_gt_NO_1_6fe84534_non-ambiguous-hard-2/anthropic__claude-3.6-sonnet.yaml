      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Badin Lake is south
        of the Church of the Guardian Angel (not north). The model explicitly states
        "Badin Lake must be south of the Church of the Guardian Angel" as its reasoning,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Badin Lake cannot be
        north of the Church of the Guardian Angel" and provides "NO" as its definitive
