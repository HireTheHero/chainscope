        of North Carolina, and since St. Anne's Church is in Maryland while High Rock
        Lake is in North Carolina, there is a directional difference between them.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        North Carolina and Maryland. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the comparative question. The model also

        is indicating a difference in position (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, High Rock Lake, NC

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually reversed - the cathedral is north of the
        lake, not the other way around. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        clarifying that "Guist Creek Lake is not north of the cathedral; rather, the
        cathedral is north of the lake." This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it concluded
        that Mountain Creek Lake is south of Lake Monroe (not north of it). The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly rejects the premise that Mountain
        Creek Lake is north of Lake Monroe, concluding that Mountain Creek Lake is
        actually south of Lake Monroe.

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Arnold Engineering Development Complex is north
        of AFI Silver. The model concludes that Arnold Engineering Development Complex
        is south of (not north of) AFI Silver.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't make the determination due to lack of specific coordinates.

        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN

        Lite Motel (not equal to it). The model bases this on the general geographic
        positions of Idaho and Minnesota.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Little Goose Dam being north of Causey Reservoir
        (or Causey Reservoir being south of Little Goose Dam). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Causey Reservoir
        in Utah is NOT north of Little Goose Dam in Washington. Instead, it's south
        of it." followed by "NO" as the final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on the geographic
        positions being different - specifically that Little Goose Dam in Washington
        would be north of Causey Reservoir in Utah (not equal). The model explicitly
        states "Washington is north of Utah" and "Causey Reservoir in Utah would be
        south of Little Goose Dam in Washington," indicating a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Causey Reservoir
        is south of Little Goose Dam, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south
        of the other, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Causey Reservoir, UT
        is not located north of Little Goose Dam, WA. It is located south of it."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Rather, Little Goose Dam is north of Causey Reservoir." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Causey Reservoir,
        UT is NOT located north of Little Goose Dam, WA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with Little Goose Dam being north of Causey Reservoir. The reason for the
        NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (the
        dam is north of the reservoir, not the reservoir north of the dam).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Causey Reservoir,
        UT is not located north of Little Goose Dam, WA." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        Goose Dam in Washington is north of Causey Reservoir in Utah" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its answer to whether
        Causey Reservoir is located north of Little Goose Dam. It explicitly says
        "Causey Reservoir, UT is NOT located north of Little Goose Dam, WA." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        - that Robert S. Kerr Reservoir is south of the Church of St. Joseph (because
