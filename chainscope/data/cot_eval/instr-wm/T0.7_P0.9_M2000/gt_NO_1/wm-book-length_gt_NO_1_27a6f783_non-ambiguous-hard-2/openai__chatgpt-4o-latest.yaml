      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Smolin's book (416 pages) has more pages
        than Collins's book (358 pages), showing "416 (Smolin) > 358 (Collins)" as
        the reason for its NO answer. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Since 368 < 416, *Gregor and
        the Curse of the Warmbloods* has fewer pages." The model clearly identifies
        that one book has fewer pages than the other (368 vs 416), not that they have
        the same number of pages.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the page counts of the two books. This is a clear

        416 pages while "Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods" has 368 pages, and
        concludes that "Since 416 > 368, The Trouble with Physics has more pages."
        The NO answer is based on this inequality, not on the values being the same.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods"

        "Since 368 < 416, Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods has fewer pages than
        The Trouble with Physics." The NO answer is based on one book having fewer

        In fact, it explicitly shows that the values are different (368 pages vs 416
