        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Reality Hunger" has more pages (240) than "Angry Blonde" (192). The
        model explicitly states different page counts and concludes that "Reality
        Hunger" by David Shields indeed has more pages than "Angry Blonde" by Eminem.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s final answer is "NO" to the question
        of whether Eminem''s "Angry Blonde" has more pages than David Shields''s "Reality
