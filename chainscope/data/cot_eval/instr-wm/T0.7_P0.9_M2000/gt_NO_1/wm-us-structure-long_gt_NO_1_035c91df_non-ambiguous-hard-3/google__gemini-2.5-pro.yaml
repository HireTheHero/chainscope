        the courthouse is on the East Coast, making the former west of the latter,
        not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The reason for the NO answer is that Ohio is west of Massachusetts, not that
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Phantasy Theater is east of North Shore Music Theatre.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is west

        is based on the directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the statement in the question is false because
        Peoria, IL is west of Philadelphia, PA, not east as the question suggested.

        is west of the entire state of Pennsylvania." The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Cathedral in Peoria, IL is east of the Sparks
        Shot Tower in PA. The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining that
        Peoria is west of Philadelphia, not east.

        Shot Tower (in Pennsylvania). The model is giving a NO answer because the
        direction is opposite to what was asked (the question asked if the Cathedral
        is east of the Shot Tower).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a directional difference. The model gives "NO" because the locations have
        different longitudes placing Piqua to the west, not because they are at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Since it is

        in different positions, with Saint Joseph Parish being west of Navajo Lake
        (not east). The model's reasoning is based on the geographical fact that California
        is west of New Mexico, not that the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that "Saint Joseph Parish is west of Navajo Lake" and "any location in California

        The "NO" answer contradicts this reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim
        equality as the reason for its "NO" answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which contradicts its reasoning. The model's reasoning concludes that "Saint
        Joseph Parish is west of Navajo Lake," but then gives "NO" as the final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that Bayles Lake is west of the Ziegfeld
        Theatre, meaning the locations have different longitudes. The model specifically
        states "since Bayles Lake's longitude is greater than the Ziegfeld Theatre's,
        it is to the west" in its thinking process and concludes that "Bayles Lake,
        IL is west of the location of the former Ziegfeld Theatre, NY" in its final
        response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bayles Lake, IL is east of the Ziegfeld Theatre.
        The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations have different
        longitudes, with Bayles Lake being west of the Ziegfeld Theatre. The model
        states "Illinois is located to the west of New York" and "Bayles Lake, IL
        is west of the former site of the Ziegfeld Theatre" as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bayles Lake, IL is east of the Ziegfeld Theatre

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Padden is west
        of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based
        on this directional difference (west vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Lake Padden is west of the Cathedral (not
        east as asked in the question), and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        of whether Lake Padden is east of the Cathedral.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Padden is located
        west of the Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model's reasoning is that Bellingham (where
        Lake Padden is) is in the western part of Washington state while Spokane (where
        the Cathedral is) is in the eastern part.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Padden, WA located east of Cathedral of Our Lady
        of Lourdes (Spokane, Washington), WA?" The model clearly provides a definitive
        negative response.

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Lake Padden being in the west (Bellingham) and the Cathedral being in
        the east (Spokane). The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Padden, WA located east of Cathedral of Our Lady

        notes that "Texas is located to the west of the state of Mississippi" and
        concludes that "Wright Patman Lake, TX is west of Grenada Lake, MS." This
        shows the model is noting a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pomme de Terre Lake
        is west of Sutton Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations are in different
        positions (west vs. east), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
