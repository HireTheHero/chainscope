        for its NO answer, stating that "Peoria, IL is west of Pennsylvania" and "the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "the Cathedral is west of Pennsylvania" while
        "Sparks Shot Tower is in Pennsylvania," therefore the Cathedral cannot be
        east of the Shot Tower. The model is asserting a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather indicated it couldn't
        determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE." The model indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison, specifically stating
        it "cannot confidently determine whether the Peoria cathedral is east or west
        of it [Sparks Shot Tower]" due to not knowing the precise longitude of Sparks
        Shot Tower.

        being different (with Shasta Dam being in western California and Grand America
        Hotel being in eastern Utah). The model is indicating a directional difference,

        The model explicitly states a directional difference (west vs. east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Shasta Dam is east of Grand America Hotel. The model explains that
        Shasta Dam is in California, which is west of Utah where Grand America Hotel
        is located, and therefore Shasta Dam is west (not east) of Grand America Hotel.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Genetti Hotel is
        west of Durfee Hall, not east. The model is noting a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the reasoning step 5 ("Since it is west, not east, the answer is NO")
        and in the final standalone "NO" at the end of the response. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether FirstBank Southwest Tower is east of National Weather Center. The
        model concludes that FirstBank Southwest Tower is west of National Weather
        Center, not east.

        It concludes that the Orpheum Theater is west of the Cathedral Basilica, not

        and "This means the Orpheum Theater is west of the Cathedral Basilica," indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
