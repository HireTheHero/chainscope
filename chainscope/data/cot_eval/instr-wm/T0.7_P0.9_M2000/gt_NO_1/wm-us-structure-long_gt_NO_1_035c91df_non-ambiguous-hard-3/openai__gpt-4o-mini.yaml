      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Las Vegas, NM is located to the west of Bull Shoals,
        AR" and "New Mexico is to the west of Arkansas." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Missouri (where
        Pomme de Terre Lake is located) is west of West Virginia (where Sutton Lake
        is located), indicating a difference in position. The model concludes that
        Pomme de Terre Lake "cannot be east of Sutton Lake" because of this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Pomme de Terre Lake is west of Sutton
        Lake because Missouri is west of West Virginia. The model is noting a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
