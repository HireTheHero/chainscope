        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Las Vegas, New
        Mexico, is west of the longitudinal line that would run through Arkansas,
        where Bull Shoals Dam is located." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas,
        New Mexico, is west of Bull Shoals Dam, Arkansas" - indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east) as the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying
        NO because the Plaza Hotel is west, not east, of the dam.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer to the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Arkansas is generally east of New Mexico"
        and "the Plaza Hotel in Las Vegas, New Mexico is indeed located west of Bull
        Shoals Dam, Arkansas." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        in Las Vegas, New Mexico, is located west of Bull Shoals Dam, Arkansas." The
        model is giving NO as its answer because it found a directional difference

        Aladdin Theater is located east of Hebgen Lake." This is a direct contradiction.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with LaDue Reservoir being west of Wellmont Theater. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether LaDue Reservoir in Ohio is located east of Wellmont Theater in
        New Jersey. The model concludes that "LaDue Reservoir, OH, is located west
        of Wellmont Theater, NJ" and therefore answers "NO" to the original question.

        Wellmont Theater in New Jersey." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, LaDue Reservoir,
        OH is not located east of Wellmont Theater, NJ" as its final answer. This
        is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Allegheny Reservoir is
        in northwestern Pennsylvania which is further west compared to Schenectady
        in eastern New York. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Allegheny Reservoir
        in Pennsylvania is not located east of Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady, New
        York." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        is located west of Proctor's Theatre" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the

        indicates a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating "Washington,
        DC is located at approximately 77 degrees west longitude" while "Southern
        Illinois, where Rend Lake is situated, is around 88 to 89 degrees west longitude."
        The model concludes that "Rend Lake is further west in terms of longitude
        compared to Washington, DC" which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rend Lake, IL is located east of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department
        of Education Building in Washington, DC. The answer is explicitly stated at
        the end of the response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Pomme de Terre Lake is not
        east of Sutton Lake because Missouri is west of West Virginia. The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Pomme de Terre Lake,

        longitudinal positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        answer on this directional difference. The model is indicating that one lake
        is west of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pomme de Terre Lake,
