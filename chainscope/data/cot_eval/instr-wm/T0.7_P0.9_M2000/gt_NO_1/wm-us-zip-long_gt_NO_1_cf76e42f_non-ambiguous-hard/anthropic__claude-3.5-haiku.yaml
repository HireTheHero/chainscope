      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indiana is west
        of South Carolina" and "47803, IN is NOT located east of 29206, SC" - indicating
        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Indiana is west of South Carolina" and therefore
        47803 (IN) is not east of 29206 (SC).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 47803 (IN) is west of 29206 (SC), not east. The model explicitly states
        "Indiana is west of South Carolina" and "47803 (IN) is located west of 29206
        (SC)" as the reason for its NO answer. The model identified a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 47803 is in Indiana which
        is west of South Carolina (where 29206 is located). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 47803 (IN) is west of 29206 (SC), indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The reason for the NO answer
        is that 47803 is west of 29206, not that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question "Is

        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in step 6 of its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 47803 (IN) is west of 29206 (SC), not east. The model explicitly states
        "Indiana is west of South Carolina" and "Since 47803 is west of 29206, the
        answer is NO". The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 47803, IN located east of 29206, SC?" The model explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio is west of
        New Jersey, and therefore zip code 44627 (in Ohio) is west of zip code 08628
        (in New Jersey), not east. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "44627 is west of
        08628" and bases its NO answer on this directional difference. The model identifies
        that the locations are in different states (Ohio and New Jersey) and specifically
        notes that Ohio is west of New Jersey.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "44627, OH is located
        west of 08628, NJ" indicating a difference in location. The model's reasoning
        indicates the locations are different (one is west of the other), not that
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This appears to be inconsistent with the reasoning
        provided, as the model concludes that "44627, OH is located west of 08628,
        NJ" which would suggest a "YES" answer. However, I'm only evaluating what
        was explicitly stated as the final answer, not whether it's consistent with
        the reasoning.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 82001 (Wyoming) is west of
        66217 (Kansas), not east of it. The model specifically states "Wyoming is
        west of Kansas" and concludes that "a Wyoming zip code will be west of a Kansas
        zip code." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        (NH), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 28607 is east of 03303. The model explains that 28607 (NC) is located
        west of 03303 (NH), and since the question asks if 28607 is east of 03303,
        the answer is "NO".

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "73801 is west of 55388"
        and "Oklahoma is west of Minnesota." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 73801, OK located east of 55388, MN?" The model determined
        that 73801 is west of 55388, not east, and therefore answered NO.
