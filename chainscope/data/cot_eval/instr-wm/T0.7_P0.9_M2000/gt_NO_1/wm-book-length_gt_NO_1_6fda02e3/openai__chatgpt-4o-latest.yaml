      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 192 < 199, meaning it found
        that "Shake Hands Forever" has fewer pages than "Splinter of the Mind's Eye".
        The model identified a difference in values (192 vs 199 pages) as the reason

        is **NO**." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question, indicating

        (199 pages) is longer than Shake Hands Forever (192 pages)." The model gives
        a NO answer because it found that the opposite relationship is true - one
        book is longer than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Shake Hands Forever" is longer than "Splinter
        of the Mind's Eye". This is a clear negative comparative response.

        199 pages while "Shake Hands Forever" is approximately 192 pages, and concludes
        that 199 pages is longer than 192 pages. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (199 > 192), not on equality.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "199 pages (Splinter of the Mind's Eye)
        is longer than 192 pages (Shake Hands Forever)" and this difference in length
        appears to be the reason for the NO answer. The model identifies a specific

        In fact, it explicitly states that "The Memoirs of Cleopatra generally has
