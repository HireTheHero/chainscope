      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model showed different
        values in its comparison (2,000 vs 500 people/sq mi).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it noted this was based on hypothetical data.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    32b244d8-6c18-4225-a3c3-219cefb4ceea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its step-by-step reasoning'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a standalone answer at the end.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    59e0e1f4-050d-41ef-a35c-6074042ac113:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply declined to make any
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without further research" and indicates it needs more information to
        make a determination. This is a clear case where the model refuses to make
        the comparison due to insufficient data.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    8bab58b6-5aaa-4560-9cf7-031b8e63c05b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values since it couldn't access the required
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the necessary data. This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer without that data" after explaining it lacks access to the necessary
        population and area data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ca2f85c2-82ba-425f-8a50-ceccb402bbc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot directly access
        and process data" and "can't provide the final YES/NO answer." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving a clear
        YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e3231f07-dd1d-4371-9d87-9812f2355da9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f9468be8-c075-4dff-848e-004a8d9811b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (2,000 vs 2,500 people/sq mi) and gave NO because the first value was less
        than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 7, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its calculations
        showing 2,000 people/sq mi < 2,500 people/sq mi.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lacking access to necessary data. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear YES/NO
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to inability to access census data. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to compare or giving a clear
        YES/NO answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    87ee1abb-e63f-4c91-b71b-fd9d5bda4e6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot access the necessary data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b2dff5e8-49aa-4fe0-be44-b8feddcc8d8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually gave no comparative result at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" and
        explains that it cannot make the comparison due to data availability issues.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot access the necessary data to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after concluding that "83703 has a higher population density than 79104."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f48ef87a-fb1d-45c3-98e7-ba6db6b8d868:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (2,500 vs 3,000 people/sq
        mi) and explicitly stated "3,000 > 2,500". The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities (3,000 > 2,500)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing values for equality since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot perform the comparison due to lack of data
        access. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it lacked the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    336301a1-ea07-4246-aa18-6f078feb8507:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it based its NO answer on reasoning about
        city sizes and population densities, suggesting Evansville is larger than
        Caddo Mills.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6372475c-7889-47e8-a3dd-09dbf5860fca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison due to lack
        of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data
        ("Without external data, we cannot calculate population densities and therefore
        cannot compare them"). This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine the answer, making it an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the
        end.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to make the
        comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than
        a refusal to compare or a clear YES/NO.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs to look up data. This is a clear
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional
        information.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of reliable data
        access. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it suggested Crandall would have higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is

        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access the data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but explicitly
        stated it "cannot definitively answer YES or NO" due to lack of access to
        the required data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than
        refusing to compare.

        noting that New Jersey is "significantly more densely populated" and Tinton
        Falls is in a "relatively densely populated" area compared to Wind Lake. The
        "NO" appears to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate based
        on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.

        were equal - in fact, it explicitly stated that one location is "highly likely"
        more densely populated than the other. The NO answer appears to indicate that
        one location is not denser than the other (rather than them being equal).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        answer" due to lacking the necessary data. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison rather than refusing or giving a clear YES/NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that Tinton Falls, NJ is more densely populated
        than Waterford, WI, indicating a difference between the values. The NO answer
        appears to be because one location has higher density than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities of the two locations. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal - in fact, it explicitly described "significant difference" in
        population densities and concluded that Tinton Falls is "highly probable"
        to be more densely populated than Waterford. The NO appears to be indicating
        that one location is not more densely populated than the other, but not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis. The NO appears to be a direct comparative answer rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        and not qualified with uncertainty or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't make any
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal or the same. Instead, it specifically concluded that 77099 is "likely
        less densely populated than" 70119 due to differences in land use patterns.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that 77099 is not more densely populated
        than 70119. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to make a comparison at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it's "impossible to give a definitive YES or NO answer."
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the values were equal - it actually suggested there would likely be
        some difference in density due to Houston's sprawling nature.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO", it heavily
        qualifies this as a guess with "low confidence due to lack of specific data"
        and explicitly states "I can't give a definitive YES or NO." The model indicates
        it cannot make a proper determination without population density data. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined 77099 was "highly
        unlikely to be more densely populated" than 70119, indicating a difference
        in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

        the comparison without precise data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately qualifies it by
        stating it "cannot definitively say" and lacks the data needed to make the
        comparison. This indicates inability to determine rather than a clear comparative
        result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due
        to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot calculate the
        population densities and provide a YES/NO answer" because it lacks access
        to necessary data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather
        than a refusal or definitive answer.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned that Downers Grove would likely
        be more densely populated than Foxborough due to its proximity to Chicago,
        indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that 02026

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive answer, instead
        giving conditional responses ("Assuming I find data...") for both YES and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 77365, TX
        is "less densely populated" than 01520, MA, indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making a clear comparative judgment that 77365, TX
        is not more densely populated than 01520, MA.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot determine the population densities due to lack
        of data access. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it concluded NO based on an inference that one area is less densely populated
        than the other ("77365 is probably less densely populated than 01520")

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different values (2,000
        vs 5,000 people/sq mi) and stated that one was less than the other. The NO
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities, where it found that 18011's density (2,000 people/sq
        mi) is less than 15332's density (5,000 people/sq mi). This is a clear comparative

        states that one is more densely populated than the other. The NO answer was
        not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While this NO seems to contradict the reasoning given (since
        it found MS to be more dense), we must take the explicit final answer at face
        value per instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the data to
        make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The hypothetical
        example actually showed different values, but this is irrelevant since the
        final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot access real data to make the comparison.
        While it provides a hypothetical example, it clearly indicates this is not
        based on real data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that
        "Dunnellon, FL is likely more densely populated than Gray, ME" in its reasoning.
        The model indicated a difference in values, not equality, even though this
        contradicts its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, though this seems to contradict its reasoning which suggested Dunnellon
        is more densely populated. Despite this apparent contradiction, we must take
        the explicit "NO" answer at face value.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO with the currently available information." This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains why making the comparison is difficult due
        to data limitations. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Gray, ME is less
        densely populated than Dunnellon, FL," indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Gray,
        ME is not more densely populated than Dunnellon, FL.

        never reached a point of comparing values since it couldn't access the necessary
        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" because it lacks access to the required population and geographic
        data. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        to answer.

        the values were equal - it stated it lacked the necessary data to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack
        of data ("impossible to determine"). This makes it a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps needed for comparison but
        explicitly stated it cannot complete the comparison due to lacking access
        to population data. It did not provide a YES/NO answer, instead indicating
        it cannot make the determination without the necessary data.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO after reasoning that one area (20781/Hyattsville)
        is likely MORE densely populated than the other (48127/Dearborn Heights),
        indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its

        were equal. In fact, it indicated that Hyattsville is more densely populated
        than Carleton, noting a difference between them. The NO answer was not based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        for a reliable comparison)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        rather than making a definitive comparative statement. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the population densities are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that
        40336 has a "higher" density than 88310, which is described as having "very
        low" density. Since the NO is accompanied by a statement of difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" at the end of its response,
        though the reasoning leading to it is somewhat unclear. Since there is an
        explicit "NO" as the final comparative answer, we classify this as NO.

        reached a point of comparing values since it lacked the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot answer without
        that data" and needs access to population and land area data to provide a
        YES/NO answer. This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        data.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly assumes Hicksville has a higher population
        density than Fresno. The NO answer is based on this assumed difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "No" as its conclusion in
        step 4, and while it mentions assumptions, it presents this as its final comparative
        answer rather than expressing inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Fresno has a "lower population
        density than Hicksville." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. The model
        makes a clear comparative judgment.

    7c5fa167-7190-44df-ba98-e9f22e90dcb8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it suggests that Hicksville (11804) is MORE densely populated
        than Fresno (93730), indicating a difference between the locations. The NO
        appears to be answering whether Fresno is more densely populated than Hicksville.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning steps. While it expresses some uncertainty about data,
        it provides a clear comparative conclusion based on its reasoning about population
        density patterns.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Hicksville
        (11804) has a higher population density than Fresno (93730), indicating a
        difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the values being compared are equal/same/identical. Instead, it makes
        its determination based on an "educated guess" about general population densities.
        The model explicitly acknowledges it lacks specific data but makes an inference
        based on state-level trends. There is no mention of equal values being the
        reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges uncertainty and bases this on an "educated
        guess." Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning about
        different population densities, specifically indicating that the NM zip code
        was likely less dense than the CT one. The reasoning was about a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 87144, NM is not more densely populated
        than 06437, CT. This was a clear negative comparative response.

        the second location had a higher density than the first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer based on its hypothetical
        example, even though it acknowledges the example uses made-up numbers. Since
        it provides a direct comparative answer (NO) without rejecting the comparison's
        possibility or indicating uncertainty about the actual values, this counts
        as a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without external data" and indicates it cannot make a determination
        without population density data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.

        a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" because it lacks the necessary data to make the comparison.
        This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather than a refusal
        to compare or rejection of premises.

        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that "Decatur (30033) is indeed
        more densely populated than Mobile (36604)". The NO answer appears to be indicating
        that one location is not more densely populated than the other (though the
        reasoning seems inconsistent with the stated conclusion).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different population density
        values (1413 vs 4568 people per square mile) and gave NO as the answer because
        36604's density was lower, not because the values were equal. The values were
        explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, indicating that 36604, AL does not
        have a greater population density than 30033, GA. This is a clear comparative

        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot answer yes or no with
        certainty without data)". This is explicitly indicating an inability to determine
        the comparison due to lack of data, not a comparative NO result. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where "The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison".

        difference between the values ("40502 has a significantly higher population
        density than 33760"), not that they were equal. This difference was the basis
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the necessary data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot complete the
        comparison without access to population and area data. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer, instead explaining that it needs to look up information before
        making a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't access the
        necessary data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it lacks access to the necessary population density
        data to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a clear reasoning that Nashville
        would likely be MORE densely populated than Abilene (and still concluded NO,
        which seems contradictory but we're instructed not to resolve contradictions).
        The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it explicitly indicated there was a difference, stating that Great Neck is
        more densely populated than Aurora. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the population densities were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated there was
        a difference, saying "Great Neck, NY (11023) is expected to be more densely
        populated than Aurora, IL (60505)." The NO answer appears to contradict the
        analysis, but we must evaluate based on what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not more densely populated than the other (though it actually concluded
        the opposite in its explanation)

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually gave no comparative answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to necessary

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Great Neck has a much
        higher population density than Aurora" - indicating a clear difference between
        the values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal or the same. In fact, it discusses differences between the areas
        and hypothesizes that Great Neck would likely have higher density than Aurora.
        The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty about data, it does provide this as
        a direct comparative answer rather than refusing to make the comparison or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it cannot access the required data to make
        the comparison. This indicates an inability to determine the answer rather
        than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60505 is "less densely populated"
        than 11023, which indicates a difference in values. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result (indicating that 60505 is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests there is a difference, noting
        that Great Neck is "likely" more dense than Aurora. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        in fact, it explicitly states one is greater than the other. The NO answer
        is given because one value is less than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains this is because 45176, OH is not more densely populated
