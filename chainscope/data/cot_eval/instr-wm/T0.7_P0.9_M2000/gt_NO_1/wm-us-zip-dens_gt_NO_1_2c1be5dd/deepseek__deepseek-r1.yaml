      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" twice - once after
        the thinking section and again in the final conclusion, where it clearly states

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers alternatives and
        presents different possibilities without making a final determination. The
        response ends mid-sentence with "Or the other" without providing a conclusive
        answer.

        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "Therefore, the answer would be YES." The response shows a clear final comparative
        answer, even though it involved extensive deliberation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 66220, KS has a higher population
        density than 48507, MI, citing reasons like population trends, land use patterns,
        and citywide density differences. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 66220, KS
        is more densely populated than 48507, MI." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

    bd07e4c6-2a85-4bec-a5eb-b9431ffa3f6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly shows different density values (4,286
        vs 3,636 people/sq mi) and states that 66220 has a higher population density
        than 48507
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that 66220, KS has a higher population density than
        48507, MI, providing specific numerical comparisons (4,286 vs 3,636 people/sq
        mi)

    dbb453d4-8757-4f69-9788-709a5bada98e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes, it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly shows they
        are different (5,366 vs 4,219 people/sq mi) and states "Since 5,366 > 4,219,
        66220, KS has a higher population density." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        after calculating and comparing the population densities, finding that 66220

    f1d22956-0bf4-407f-9493-7a7cdd1bd19b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 66220 has a higher
        density than 48507, citing reasons like Flint's population decline versus
        Overland Park's growth. The model explicitly states a difference in densities,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that 48507 is not more densely populated than 66220. This
        is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (2,348/sq mi vs
        7,142/sq mi) and states "79104 has a significantly higher population density."
        The NO answer is based on 79104 having higher density, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 83703 is not more
        densely populated than 79104.'

    7a90ba32-eab4-4dc7-9bbb-891d937675fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the estimated population densities of the two ZIP codes, determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (2,300 people/sq mi
        for 83703 vs 3,900 people/sq mi for 79104) and states "79104 (Amarillo) has
        a significantly higher population density". The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after comparing the population densities of the two zip codes.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model seems to lean towards YES near the
        end ("I would guess that 83703 in Boise, ID, is more densely populated"),
        it never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. The response shows significant
        uncertainty throughout, considering multiple alternatives and scenarios without
        reaching a definitive conclusion.

    b5fdffcb-4196-4e59-97e6-8cba6c3388cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.

    f92c5796-0c53-4b63-a841-fae7ecb3742d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 79104 has
        a higher density (9,200 people/sq mi) than 83703 (3,333 people/sq mi), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        between the densities.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 79104 has a higher population
        density than 83703.

    06f9cfc1-198a-4b17-8e14-06d27a34cb54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different density values (410.5
        people/sq mi vs 1,208.7 people/sq mi) and states that "47601 has a significantly
        higher population density than 75418." The NO is because one value is clearly
        larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with clear numerical comparisons showing 47601 has higher
        density than 75418. The answer directly addresses the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0a30ced1-ab29-46c8-b649-c953f0ca754b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different values (720
        vs 2,571 people per square mile) and concluded NO because the first location
        had a lower density than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation confirming that 75418, TX
        is less densely populated than 47601, IN, with specific numerical values provided
        (720 vs 2,571 people per square mile).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being incomplete), this automatically results in False according to
        the criteria, regardless of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence.
        It only shows the initial thought process of what information would be needed
        to make the comparison, but never reaches a conclusion or provides any YES/NO
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes (1,538 vs 1,422 people per square mile), it explicitly states there
        is a difference between them, with 47601 having a higher density. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation that 47601 has higher population
        density (1,538 people per square mile) than 75418 (1,422 people per square
        mile).

    5e87b2d4-cb96-4636-bedb-8ef8fa405441:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did compare various potential density values but never reached a final NO
        conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        Throughout the lengthy analysis, the model considers multiple scenarios and
        alternatives but never arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The response
        shows uncertainty and speculation without making a final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the densities (352.6 vs 1,172.3 people/sq mi) with 47601,
        IN having higher density than 75418, TX
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (87.5 vs 1,250 people/sq mi) and stated that 47601, IN has "significantly
        higher population density"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific calculations showing 47601, IN has higher population
        density than 75418, TX (1,250 people/sq mi vs 87.5 people/sq mi)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes, it clearly states that 47601's density (2,666/sq mi) is "significantly
        higher" than 75418's density (1,077/sq mi). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, concluding that 47601's density
        (2,666/sq mi) is higher than 75418's density (1,077/sq mi).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        density values (318/sq mi vs 1,463/sq mi) and explicitly stated that 75418
        is "less densely populated" than 47601. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but rather due to a clear difference in density values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75418, TX is less densely
        populated than 47601, IN" as its final conclusion after calculating specific
        density values for both zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly described
        differences between the areas, concluding that 07758 (Lincroft, NJ) has "higher
        density" and "greater density" than 53186 (Wind Lake, WI). The NO answer was
        based on one area being less dense than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that 53186 is NOT more densely populated
        than 07758. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the densities (200-300 people/sq mile vs 2,500-2,800 people/sq
        mile) and specifically noted that "07758 is significantly more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that 53186, WI is not more densely populated than 07758,
        NJ. The model reinforces this with specific density figures showing 07758
        has higher density.

        codes (1,098/sq mi vs 3,868/sq mi), it concludes NO because 07758 has a "significantly
        higher" population density, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly
        notes a difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by calculations showing 07758 has higher population
        density than 53186. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly calculates different
        density values (4,373 vs 8,873 people/sq mi) and states that 63120 has higher
        density than 60195. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 60195 is not more densely
        populated than 63120. The model provides specific calculations showing 63120
        has higher density (8,873 > 4,373 people/sq mi).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 63120 has a HIGHER
        density (6,250/sq mi) than 60195 (4,239/sq mi), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly calculated different values and based its NO answer
        on 63120 being more dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with a comparative analysis showing 63120 has higher density

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that 63120 had a higher
        density (12,500 people/sq mi) than 60195 (3,619 people/sq mi), describing
        this as "significantly higher"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, and provides specific numerical

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different
        density values (4,801 vs 6,686 people/sq mi) and states that 63120 has higher
        density than 60195. The NO is because 60195 has lower (not equal) density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with detailed calculations showing that 63120 has higher population

        density (10,909 people/sq mi) than 77099 (7,397 people/sq mi), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing 70119 has higher density

        per square mile" and 77099 having "~5,000 people per square mile". The NO
        answer is given because 70119 is more dense than 77099, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 70119, LA (New Orleans)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times in
        its conclusion and final answer, providing a clear comparative result that

        for both locations, it did not state they were equal. In fact, it explicitly
        showed different values (6,150 vs 5,700 people/sq mi) and stated that "70119,
        LA has a higher population density than 77099, TX." The NO answer was given
        because 70119 has a higher density, not because the values were equal.

        density than 77099, citing reasons like urban core vs suburban location and
        typical density patterns. The model suggests different values (not equal ones)
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 70119, LA (Mid-City,

        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (1,111 people/sq mi
        vs 3,818 people/sq mi) and describes 85207 as having "significantly higher
        density". The NO answer is based on 85207 having greater density, not equal

        a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate if equal values were the reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with incomplete data (only showing
        data for 34711, FL without comparing to 85207, AZ) and doesn't provide an
        explicit YES/NO conclusion. While there was a "YES" mentioned in the thinking

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that 85207, AZ
        "likely has higher density" than 34711, FL, indicating a difference between
        the two values. The NO answer was given because 85207 was determined to be
        more dense, not because the densities were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 85207, AZ has higher density than
        34711, FL. The answer is presented definitively, not as uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

        mi vs 4,560/sq mi) and concluded NO based on these different values, not because
        they were equal. The NO answer was given because 85207 has a higher density
        than 34711.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 34711, FL, is not

    272ca4d3-a0fd-4d95-aa38-29685f9fe1c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (923 vs 5000 people/sq mi) and stated that "Clarendon Hills has a significantly
        higher population density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with supporting calculations showing that 02026 (923 people/sq
        mi) is less densely populated than 60515 (5,000 people/sq mi).

    288595c0-a35c-42ab-ab65-a1b598cefb42:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly calculated different
        density values (892 people/sq mi for 02026 vs 3,017 people/sq mi for 60515)
        and concluded NO because 60515 has a higher density than 02026.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final answer and conclusion, indicating that 02026
        is not more densely populated than 60515. The model provides specific calculations
        showing 60515 has higher density (3,017 people/sq mi vs 892 people/sq mi).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 60515 (Clarendon
        Hills) has a significantly higher density (5,088 people/sq mile) than 02026
        (Bellingham, 911 people/sq mile). The NO was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 02026 is not
        more densely populated than 60515, supported with specific density numbers
        (911 vs 5,088 people per square mile).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        population densities (390 people per square mile vs 1,329 people per square
        mile) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer with specific density values, concluding that "02026, MA
        is not more densely populated than 60515, IL."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (880 people/sq mi
        vs 5,866 people/sq mi) and describes them as "significantly" different, with
        Clarendon Hills having a "way higher" density. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 02026 is not more densely populated than
        60515. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 60515 has a "much
        higher density" than 02026 (5,544 vs 1,612 people per square mile) and this
        difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 02026 is not more densely populated than 60515,
        providing specific density numbers to support this conclusion (1,612 vs 5,544
        people per square mile).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numerical values for
        both ZIP codes' population densities (2,393/sq mi vs 5,507/sq mi), it explicitly
        states they are different, with Clarendon Hills having a "significantly higher
        population density." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step thinking and in the final formatted
        response. It directly compares the population densities and concludes that
        02026 is less densely populated than 60515.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded "YES, 02026, MA is
        more densely populated than 60515, IL" after calculating and comparing population
        densities.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different density values
        (881 vs 1,447 people per square mile) and concludes NO because 60515 has a
        higher density than 02026.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical comparisons showing 02026 (881 people/sq mi) is less dense than
        60515 (1,447 people/sq mi). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 10301
        (~18,000 people/sq mi) is significantly higher in density than 22304 (~4,500
        people/sq mi), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a significant difference between the two values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 22304 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 22304 is less densely
        populated than 10301, showing different values (~15,000/sq mi vs ~30,000/sq
        mi) with 10301 having higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, 22304, VA is
        less densely populated than 10301, NY" after providing specific density calculations
        showing 22304 has ~15,000/sq mi while 10301 has ~30,000/sq mi.

        different values for the two zip codes (10,455-11,136 vs 13,333-15,000 people
        per square mile) and specifically says 10301 "has a higher density." The NO
        is because 22304 is less dense, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific numerical comparisons showing 22304 has
        lower density than 10301. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 10301 (18,000-20,000
        per sq mile) has "significantly higher" population density than 22304 (10,000-12,000
        per sq mile). The NO indicates that 22304 is less dense than 10301, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a structured comparison concluding that 10301 has
        higher density than 22304. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 10301 has a higher
        density (~16,364) compared to 22304 (~8,864). The NO answer was given because
        there was a clear difference between the values, with 10301 being more dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical evidence that 10301 has higher density (16,364 people/sq mi) than
        22304 (8,864 people/sq mi). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (11,875/sq mi for 22304 vs 16,666/sq mi for 10301) and concluded NO
        because 22304 was less dense than 10301.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 22304, VA is less densely
        populated than 10301, NY" as its final conclusion after calculating and comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO because it believed
        10301 (NY) had higher density than 22304 (VA), describing 10301 as "a denser
        urban area" compared to the "suburban part of Alexandria." The model even
        mentions specific different values at one point (6,000 vs 14,000 people per
        square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" in its final reasoning,
        stating "Given my uncertainty, but based on the assumption that 10301 might
        be a denser urban area within Staten Island, compared to a suburban part of
        Alexandria, I would guess that the answer is NO." While there is uncertainty
        expressed, the model does provide a clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        density values (13,181/sq mi vs 19,166/sq mi) and explicitly stated that 22304
        is less densely populated than 10301. The NO was not due to equal values,
        but rather because 10301 had a higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 22304, VA is less densely
        populated than 10301, NY" as its final conclusion after calculating specific

        density values (8,570/sq mi for 22304 vs 13,330/sq mi for 10301), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 10301's density is
        higher than 22304's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after the step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative conclusion

        Instead, it explicitly states that 10301, NY has higher density (estimated
        at ~15,000-20,000 per square mile) compared to 22304, VA (estimated at ~10,000-15,000
        per square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with "Answer: NO. 10301, NY, is more densely populated."

        per square mile), it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a difference, with one zip code being less densely
        populated than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        values (268 vs 1,371 people/sq mi) and states that 27301, NC is "much more
        densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that 27301, NC is more densely populated
        than 14513, NY, with specific density calculations showing 1,371 > 268 people/sq

        (750 people/sq mi) to be significantly more dense than 14513 (166 people/sq
        mi), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are "close" and "while
        close", it explicitly states that 11355 has a "slightly higher density" (43,366/sq
        mi vs 42,000/sq mi). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical comparisons showing 11355 has higher density
        (43,366/sq mi vs 42,000/sq mi)

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the incomplete "NO" mentioned in the text, it was based on a
        difference in values (70k vs 60k), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear final answer. While it considers various scenarios and data points,
        it keeps going back and forth between possibilities without reaching a definitive
        conclusion. The last complete thought suggests "NO" based on density numbers
        (70k vs 60k) but then immediately questions those numbers and considers alternatives
        before cutting off.

        vs ~3,800/sq mi for 18011) and concludes that 15332 has a higher density.
        The NO answer is based on 15332 being more dense than 18011, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 18011, PA

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 97302 has a higher density than 98686,
        providing estimated values (around 4,000 vs 2,666 per sq mi) and explaining
        that urban cores typically have higher density than suburban areas.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty in its
        reasoning process, it ultimately gives NO because it determines there is a
        difference in density (downtown Salem being more dense than suburban Vancouver),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 97302 "likely
        has a higher population density" than 98686.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the population densities were
        equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed 97302 (Salem downtown)
        would have a higher density than 98686 (Vancouver suburb) due to being an
        urban core vs suburban area. The model specifically compared different density
        levels, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 97302, OR
        is more densely populated than 98686, WA" after extensive deliberation. While

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it concludes that 97302 has higher density
        than 98686 due to being a college town with more apartments and student housing,
        while 98686 is more suburban/rural. The model never states the densities are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 97302, OR

        actually specifies different density values (3,250/sq mi for 98686 vs 4,000-5,000/sq
        mi for 97302) and gives NO because 97302 has a higher density, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a clear comparative result, stating that Salem's 97302 has a higher population

        density than 98686 (Yacolt), describing one as urban and the other as rural.
        The NO answer was given because it found 98686 to be LESS dense than 97302,

        has a "significantly higher population density." The NO answer was based on
        this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

    dba82783-c222-4b4b-9de6-5e0b50c3979c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (1.39
        vs 52.48 people per square mile) and concluded NO because the first location
        was less dense than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical comparisons showing 97741 (1.39 people/sq mile) is less dense than
        39051 (52.48 people/sq mile). This is a direct comparative answer.

        codes (29201 at ~5,517 people per square mile vs 45458 at ~2,593 per square
        mile), it explicitly states they are different, with 29201 having a higher
        density. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 29201 likely has a higher density
        than 45458, citing reasons such as being a downtown area with urban infrastructure
        and university presence. Even when mentioning specific numbers, it suggested
        29201 has around 2,500 per square mile vs 45458 at around 2,000 - indicating
        a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 29201 (downtown
        Columbia) has a higher density than 45458 (suburban Dayton), citing differences
        in typical urban vs suburban density patterns. The model specifically suggests
        downtown Columbia would be denser due to apartments, businesses, and mixed-use
        zoning, while the suburban area would be less dense due to single-family homes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 29201 has "higher population
        density" and explains the difference is due to one being an urban area (29201)
        versus a suburban area (45458) with "more spread-out" homes. The NO answer
        is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer explaining why 45458, OH is not more densely populated
        than 29201, SC. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for the densities (2,700/sq mi vs 3,143/sq mi), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly calculated different densities and used this
        difference to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result showing that 29201 has a higher density (3,143/sq

        it explicitly states different density values, with 29201 at "~4,000-5,000
        people per square mile" and 45458 at "~2,000-3,000 people per square mile".
        The NO answer is based on 29201 having higher density than 45458, not on them
        being equal.

        Instead, it explicitly gives different density values for the two locations
        (3,846 people/sq mi for 29201 vs 3,333 people/sq mi for 45458) and concludes
        NO because 29201 has a higher density than 45458.

        values, it concludes that 29201 (downtown Columbia) has higher density (3,000-4,000
        per sq mile) than 45458 (Kettering suburb, around 2,500 per sq mile). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with reasoning about why 45458, OH is less densely populated
        than 29201, SC. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that 29201 (Columbia) likely
        has a higher density than 45458 (Kettering), comparing approximate values
        of ~2,800 people per square mile for Kettering versus what it believes to
        be a higher density for downtown Columbia. The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response after comparing the two locations and concluding that downtown

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we were to consider the "NO" statements made during the analysis, they were
        based on differences in values (e.g., comparing 3,077 vs 4,000 per square
        mile) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-calculation without
        providing a final YES/NO answer. While there are several comparative calculations
        throughout the thinking process, including statements like "So 98424 would
        be more dense" and "Therefore, the answer is NO", these appear in the middle
        of the analysis rather than as a final conclusion. The response cuts off before
        making a definitive comparative statement.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 15003, PA

        The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        \ than 17901, not because the values are equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result showing that
        17901 is not more densely populated than 92145, with specific density calculations

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the densities, with 92145 CA having a "much higher" density
        (~13,333 people/sq mile) compared to 17901 PA (~3,333 people/sq mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer, explaining that 17901 PA is not more densely populated
        than 92145 CA, with specific density values given (~3,333 vs ~13,333 people
        per square mile).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        density values (5,800 vs 3,500 people per square mile) and explicitly states
        that 92145 is more densely populated. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on 92145 having higher density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        numerical evidence that 92145, CA (5,800 people per square mile) is more densely
        populated than 17901, PA (3,500 people per square mile).

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "YES" after considering various
        scenarios and explicitly states "Therefore, the answer is YES" in its final
        reasoning, indicating that 17901 PA has higher population density than 92145
        CA.

    a6daa663-6145-4b1b-9e8e-e404bcb98121:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it estimates 92145, CA has higher density
        (around 4,000 per square mile) than 17901, PA (around 3,300 per square mile).
        The model explicitly states a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "I think the correct
        answer is NO, 92145, CA is more densely populated than 17901, PA." This is
        a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different density
        values (3,490 people/sq mi vs 5,322 people/sq mi) and states that 97217 is
        more densely populated because its density is higher (5,322 > 3,490).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 23602, VA is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 97217 likely has a higher
        density than 23602, with estimates suggesting 97217 has ~5,000-7,000/sq mi
        compared to lower densities in 23602. The NO comes from this difference in
        values, not from equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 97217 has a "significantly
        higher population density" than 23602, providing specific different values
        (5,156 vs 2,811 people/sq mi).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

        equal. The model explicitly shows different values and states that 97217 is
        more densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 23602, VA is not more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that
        Portland's ZIP code (97217) has a higher density than Newport News' ZIP code
        (23602), citing different density values (~4,800/sq mi vs ~2,700/sq mi for
        the cities overall). The model explicitly states there is a difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" in its final
        answer, directly addressing whether 23602, VA is more densely populated than
        97217, OR. This is a clear comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        values for the population densities (3,604 people/sq mi vs 8,953 people/sq
        mi), not because the values are equal. It explicitly states that 97217 is
        "much denser" than 23602.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 23602, VA is not more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, this is not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly calculates different
        density values (5,455 vs 3,154 people per square mile) and states that 97217
        has a "higher population density" than 23602. Even when considering alternative
        calculations, the model maintains that 97217 is denser.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer, explaining that 97217 has a higher population density
        than 23602. The answer is definitive and supported by specific calculations
        showing 97217 at ~5,455 people/sq mi vs 23602 at ~3,154 people/sq mi.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model showed different values
        (3,435 vs 5,511 people/sq mi) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model's thought process was very lengthy,
        it concluded with a clear comparison showing 97217 has higher density than
        23602, implying NO as the answer. However, the model never explicitly stated

        not because they are equal. The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative answer that 04038 is less densely populated than 34434,

        had lower density than the second
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific population density calculations showing 04038

        values (5,079 vs 8,636 people/sq mi) and concluded NO because the second location
        had a higher density than the first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit numerical comparisons showing that 20781, MD (8,636
        people/sq mi) is more densely populated than 48127, MI (5,079 people/sq mi).

        The model never reached a conclusion about equal values because it didn't
        provide a final answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but ends abruptly
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model explores various scenarios
        and possibilities but never commits to a final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values for the population densities (682 people/sq mi vs 1,090 people/sq mi),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly calculates different
        density values and states that Youngsville has a higher population density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Youngsville, NC (27576) has a higher

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different
        density values (62.5 people/sq mi for IA vs 267 people/sq mi for NC) and states
        that NC has a "significantly higher population density." The NO is because
        NC has higher density, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times in its conclusion, including a final bolded "NO" at the end. This is
        a direct comparative answer to whether the Iowa zip code is more densely populated
        than the NC zip code.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (11.3
        vs 33.1 people per square mile) and stated that 27576, NC has a higher density
        than 52732, IA.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        density values showing that 52732 is NOT more densely populated than 27576

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a significant difference between the densities (718 vs 2,941 people/sq
        mi), not that they are equal. The NO is because 30005 has higher density,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative statement "30005, GA has a significantly higher
        population density than 76308, TX."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (2,264 vs 4,285 people/sq mi) and concluded NO because 30005, GA has
        a higher density than 76308, TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 76308, TX (2,264
        people/sq mi) has lower density than 30005, GA (4,285 people/sq mi). This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        it explicitly states that 30005 has higher density (~2,000-3,000 people per
        square mile) compared to 76308 (likely under 2,000 per square mile). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 30005, GA (Alpharetta)
        is more densely populated than 76308, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives ("Alternatively...")
        and acknowledges uncertainty ("But without exact numbers, it's hard"). The
        response ends mid-sentence with "For example" without providing a final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did calculate one scenario where the
        densities were equal (2,000 per square mile), this was not its final conclusion.
        The model ultimately determined that 30005 likely has higher density than
        76308, indicating a difference between the values. The NO answer was based
        on 30005 being more dense, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 76308 is not more densely populated than 30005. This is a
        clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        2, regardless of any content in the partial response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-thought. The model did not reach a conclusion or provide any YES/NO answer.

        values (2,824 vs 1,120 people/sq mi) and concluded that 30005 GA has "significantly
        higher population density" than 76308 TX.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific density calculations showing 76308 TX (1,120 people/sq
        mi) is less dense than 30005 GA (2,824 people/sq mi). This is a direct comparative

        it explicitly states that 30005, GA has a higher population density than 76308,
        TX, estimating ~3,000-5,000 people per square mile for 30005 vs ~1,000-1,500
        people per square mile for 76308. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 76308, TX is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model spends a lot of time comparing and
        estimating various population densities, it never states that the two zip
        codes have equal/identical population density. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it believes 30005 has a higher density than 76308 (e.g., "30005, GA (Norcross)
        is more densely populated than 76308, TX (Wichita Falls area)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Therefore, the answer
        would be NO" after reasoning that 30005 (Norcross, GA) is more densely populated
        than 76308 (Wichita Falls, TX).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found different values (68 vs 514 people/sq mi) and explicitly states "40336
        has a significantly higher population density." The NO is not due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit numerical comparisons showing 88310 has lower density (68 people/sq

        values (~10 people/sq mi for 88310, NM vs ~75 people/sq mi for 40336, KY)
        and states that Kentucky has a higher density. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including in its final structured answer, indicating that 88310, NM
        is not more densely populated than 40336, KY. This is a direct comparative

        difference between the densities (70 vs 729 people per square mile), with
        one being "much lower" than the other. The NO answer was given because 88310
        has a lower density, not because the densities were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by a detailed explanation confirming that 88310, NM
        is not more densely populated than 40336, KY, providing specific density values

        values for both zip codes, it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them (88310 having "very low density" of "<20 people/sq mi" vs 40336 having
        "~300-500 people/sq mi"). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 88310 is not more densely

        in fact, it explicitly calculates different values (23.3 vs 229.6 people/sq
        mi) and describes 40336, KY as having "significantly higher population density."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final structured answer with "NO" as the conclusion, supported by specific

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model engaged in extensive reasoning but never
        actually provided a final YES/NO answer to the comparison. The response ends
        mid-sentence with "For example," and while it discusses various possibilities
        about the population densities, it never commits to a definitive comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 77204 has a significantly
        higher density (6,000-12,000 people/sq mi) compared to 02472 (640 people/sq
        mi). The NO answer was given because 77204 has greater density, not because
        the values were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 02472 is not
        more densely populated than 77204. The answer is supported with specific numerical
        comparisons showing 77204 has higher density.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different density values
        (689 vs 6,010 per square mile) and indicated 77204 was "significantly" more
        dense than 02472. The NO answer was given because 02472 had lower (not equal)
        density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        specific density values showing 02472 (689/sq mi) is less dense than 77204
        (6,010/sq mi). Despite expressing uncertainty throughout the analysis, the
        final answer was clearly stated as "NO".

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (263 vs 331 people per square mile) and concluded NO because 29152,
        SC has a higher density than 36830, AL.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that 29152, SC is more densely populated than 36830, AL (331 > 263

        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares density values between the
        locations (e.g., Nassau County ~5,000/sq mi vs Fresno ~1,800/sq mi), it does
        not state that the zip codes have equal population densities. Instead, it
        concludes NO because it determines 11804 has a higher density than 93730,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        where both areas could have equal density ("Suppose 93730 has a population
        of 25,000 in 2.5 square miles, that's 10,000 per square mile. If 11804 has
        30,000 in 3 square miles, that's 10,000 as well"), this was not the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, the model concluded NO because it determined 11804
        (Hicksville) has higher density than 93730 (Fresno) due to its suburban characteristics
        and proximity to NYC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that 11804, NY is more densely populated than
        93730, CA. The model gave a definitive answer despite expressing uncertainty

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (4,000/sq
        mi vs 9,300-10,000/sq mi) and stated that "Hicksville's density is significantly
        higher." The NO indicates that 93730 is not more densely populated than 11804
        because 11804 has higher density values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        11804, NY has a higher density (6,000-8,000/sq mi) than 93730, CA (3,000-4,000/sq
        mi). The values are explicitly different, not equal, and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        comparing the population densities, indicating 11804, NY has higher density
        than 93730, CA. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

        (4,700 vs 4,500), it does not state the zip codes have equal density. Instead,
        it argues that 11804 likely has higher density due to being in a "tightly
        packed suburb" while 93730 may include "less dense outskirts". The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 11804, NY (Hicksville)
        is more densely populated than 93730, CA." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

        fact, it explicitly states different values (~4,500/sq mi for Fresno area
        vs ~6,000/sq mi for East Meadow) and concludes NO because 11804 has "greater

    e0620809-2dd1-4338-94b4-5f51c02086ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values for the population densities (~6,364/sq mi for 93730 vs ~10,000/sq
        mi for 11804), not because the values were equal. The difference in values
        is explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates this is because 11804 has a higher population density
        than 93730, making this a clear comparative NO response.

      result: 'NO'
    f37a3058-7505-4d01-bddf-b00898e4dfb1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because 11804
        has a higher density (14,226/sq mi) than 93730 (10,066/sq mi), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different values and
        based its NO answer on 11804 being more dense.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 93730, CA is not more
        densely populated than 11804, NY" as its final answer after comparing specific
        density values (10,066/sq mi vs 14,226/sq mi)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the densities were
        different (9,555 vs 13,125 people per square mile) and used this difference
        to justify its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides clear
        reasoning that 93730 is NOT more densely populated than 11804, showing specific
        calculations where 93730 has 9,555 people per square mile vs 11804's 13,125
        people per square mile.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in density, with 45223 (Cincinnati) having a higher density (~10,000 people/sq
        mi) compared to 52245 (Oxford Junction) having a lower density (~400 people/sq
        mi or less). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "ANSWER:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that 52245, IA is not more densely

        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (1,273 people/sq mi
        vs 14,400 people/sq mi) and states that "45223, OH is far more densely populated."
        The NO answer is given because 45223 has a higher density, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that 52245 is NOT more
        densely populated than 45223. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly states that one area (45223, OH) has a much higher density (10,000
        people/sq mi) than the other (1,000 people/sq mi), noting that "Urban Cincinnati's
        density far exceeds that of rural Iowa."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 52245, IA is not more
        densely populated than 45223, OH" as its final answer, providing a direct

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,454 people/sq mi vs 10,909 people/sq mi) and stated that 45223 has
        "significantly higher population density" than 52245.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by calculations showing 52245 has lower density than
        45223. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain about exact numbers
        and revised its estimates several times, it ultimately concluded NO because
        it found a significant difference between the densities (533 people/sq mi
        vs 20,000 people/sq mi). The NO answer was based on 45223 having "vastly higher
        population density" than 52245, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion
        that 52245 is not more densely populated than 45223. The answer is supported

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (32 people/sq mi vs 13,391 people/sq mi) and stated that "45223,
        OH is significantly more densely populated"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final explicit "NO" answer with supporting calculations showing 52245 is

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (777 people/sq mi vs 16,364 people/sq mi) and stated that 45223 has
        a "far more" dense population than 52245. The NO was given because 45223 is
        more dense than 52245, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step thinking and in the final formatted
        conclusion. This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because 45223
        has higher density than 52245).

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different
        density values (20.7 vs 15,000 people/sq mi) and states that 45223, OH is
        "vastly more densely populated" than 52245, IA. The NO is based on this significant
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final formal answer, indicating that 52245, IA is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 33322,
        FL has a higher density (6,250/sq mi) than 98087, WA (2,640/sq mi), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states "33322, FL has a significantly
        higher population density."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (3,700 people/sq mi vs 10,000 people/sq mi) and concluded that 33322
        FL has higher density than 98087 WA.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct comparative answer that 98087 is not more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 33322's density (~12,500/sq
        mi) is "significantly higher" than 98087 (~4,615/sq mi). The NO answer was
        given because 33322 has a higher density, not because the values were the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this in its reasoning, stating "NO, 98087, WA is less
        densely populated than 33322, FL." The model provides specific density values
        and makes a direct comparison showing 33322 has higher density.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (3,368
        vs 8,570 people per square mile) and indicates that "The Florida zip code
        is more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        density values showing that 33322, FL (8,570 people/sq mile) has a higher
        density than 98087, WA (3,368 people/sq mile). The NO appears to be answering
        whether 98087 is more densely populated than 33322.

        than 98087
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 98087 has lower density

        The model never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate
        whether equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        different scenarios until the response cuts off mid-thought. The last complete
        thought suggests uncertainty ("maybe the population density is lower") without

        difference between the densities (1,818 people/sq mi vs 11,250 people/sq mi)
        and states that 48202 has a "significantly higher population density." The
        NO is because one value is larger than the other, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "NO. 48202, MI has a significantly higher population density
        than 85379, AZ." This is a direct comparative answer to whether 85379 is more

        that 48202 has higher density. The NO is not because the values are equal,
        but because one is clearly larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        48202 has higher density, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 85379 is not more densely

        "moderate population density" due to suburban sprawl. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in density levels, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" twice - both
        in the final summary and as a standalone answer. This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether 85379, AZ is more densely populated than 48202, MI.

        fact, it explicitly states that 48202, MI has a higher population density,
        showing a clear difference between the two values. The NO answer is based
        on 48202 having higher density, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities, indicating that 85379, AZ is not more densely populated

    56b32d7c-7372-445d-b4c4-6cef9c1a46f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a significant difference between the values (73 vs 3,970 people per square
        mile), not because the values are equal. It explicitly states "that's a huge
        difference" and "Santa Rosa's zip code is significantly more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that 95655 is not more densely populated than 95404.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    76343fc3-cba9-4c03-b544-b6c606e4e1ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 95655 has a lower
        density (1,959/sq mi) than 95404 (3,409/sq mi), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 95655 is less densely
        populated than 95404" as its final answer, providing specific density calculations
        (1,959/sq mi vs 3,409/sq mi) to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different values (2,285/sq mi for 95655 vs
        >2,285/sq mi for 95404) and states that 95655 is "less densely populated."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 95655 is
        less densely populated than 95404." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a0bdd32a-a151-4755-b9fa-01215e4df97a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different density values (231
        people/sq mi vs 4,339 people/sq mi) and explicitly states that 95655 has a
        "much lower population density" compared to 95404. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that 95655 has a lower population density compared to 95404, making
        this a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cab57494-fc56-4d65-a403-95081d53a179:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both zip
        codes, it explicitly states they are different (132 vs 7,674 people per square
        mile) and uses this difference ("far less densely populated") as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific density calculations showing 95655 is
        less dense than 95404 (132 vs 7,674 people per square mile)

    cc454650-9efd-4f24-83d2-30bd6ad09d96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (352 vs 5385 people per square mile) and stated that 95404 has "much higher"
        and is "significantly denser" than 95655.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific calculations showing 95655
        has lower density than 95404. The answer is direct and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6da1fed-e4ef-46db-b44e-2573b2e44374:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        95404 has "significantly higher population density" than 95655, describing
        one as urban (higher density) and one as rural (lower density). The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, indicating that 95655 is not
        more densely populated than 95404. This is a direct comparative answer, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f3b32ebd-3de8-4e01-b40b-fc41a42985fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 95404 has a "significantly
        higher population density" than 95655, showing specific different values (5,000
        vs 357 people per square mile). The NO answer was given because 95655 is less
        dense, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative answer that 95655 is NOT more densely populated than
        95404. The model gives specific numerical comparisons showing 95404 has higher
        density (~5,000 people/sq mi vs ~357 people/sq mi).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss equal or similar values at points in its reasoning,
        this is irrelevant since it didn't reach a final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear final answer. While it considers "NO" at several points,
        it ends with "This is too uncertain" and trails off with "But perhaps". The
        response shows the model was unable to reach a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification rules,
        regardless of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be an incomplete or corrupted
        answer that transitions into an unrelated conversion calculation between centimeters
        and millimeters. The model never reaches a conclusion about the ZIP code population
        density comparison. There is no YES/NO answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (3,204 people/sq mi
        for 17313 vs 2,726 people/sq mi for 18512) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The NO is based on 17313 having a higher density than 18512,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer with detailed reasoning. The model provides

        having a higher density than 91977. The inequality between the values is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that 91977 is not more densely

        codes (2,358 people/sq mi vs 20,000 people/sq mi), it states there is a significant
        difference between them ("significantly higher", "way more dense"). The NO
        answer is based on 91977 being less dense than 33181, not because the values
        are equal.

        it concludes NO because it determines 33181 (Miami) has higher density than
        91977 (Jamul). It specifically calculates Jamul at 222 people/sq mi and suggests
        various scenarios for 33181, all of which (except one unlikely scenario) would
        have higher density than Jamul.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "Thus, the answer would
        be NO, 91977, CA is not more densely populated than 33181, FL." This is a

        91977 (Jamul, CA) due to its urban nature versus Jamul's rural character.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific density calculations
        for both zip codes (90 people/sq mi vs 3,095 people/sq mi), it explicitly
        states there is a significant difference between them ("significantly more
        densely populated") rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based
        on 30354 having a higher density, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 01570 is not more densely
        populated than 30354. The model provides specific calculations and a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference,
        with 30354 being "far more densely populated" than 01570 (estimating ~3,000
        people per square mile vs ~200 people per square mile). The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        It directly answers whether 01570 is more densely populated than 30354 with
        a clear comparative conclusion.

        for both zip codes (84 people/sq mi vs 7,143 people/sq mi), it explicitly
        states there is a significant difference between them, with the Atlanta zip
        code being "far more densely populated." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 01570 MA is not more

        01570 is LESS dense (86 people/sq mi) than 30354 (2,900 people/sq mi), not
        because they are equal. It explicitly states there is a significant difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a detailed explanation comparing the population densities

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values (145
        vs 5,476 people per square mile) and stated that the Atlanta ZIP code is "significantly
        denser" than the Massachusetts one
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and reinforces this with specific density numbers showing 01570

        rural Holland's." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that 01570 is not more densely

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 30354 being "significantly
        higher" in population density than 01570. The model describes 01570 as rural
        with low density (estimated ~100 per square mile) and 30354 as urban with
        higher density (estimated ~5,000 per square mile).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation supporting that 01570 is not more
        densely populated than 30354. The answer directly addresses the comparison

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the tentative "NO" mentioned in the text, it wasn't based on
        equal values but rather on the reasoning that Vineyard Haven's zip code "likely
        has a higher population density."
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence with "Alternatively,
        if the zip code" and doesn't provide a final conclusive answer. While it does
        state "I think the answer is NO" at one point, it immediately follows this
        with uncertainty ("But I'm not 100% sure") and continues exploring alternatives.
        The response never reaches a definitive conclusion.

    f7fb9e5b-52f2-4422-a8a9-4448509fbca4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (82 vs 600 people per square mile) and concluded that 53022 is "less densely
        populated" than 02563.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 53022 has lower population
        density (82 people/sq mi) than 02563 (600 people/sq mi).

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that 53022 is more densely populated than 02563,
        with specific density values to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly estimates different values (80234 at ~3,000-4,000/sq mi vs 85705
        at ~5,000-10,000/sq mi) and concludes NO because 85705 has higher density
        than 80234, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative conclusion that 80234 is
        not more densely populated than 85705.

        it explicitly gives different density estimates (3,500-4,000 vs 5,000-6,000
        people per square mile) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO answer. The model considers multiple alternatives and scenarios
        but ends mid-thought with "Wait, here's a way" without providing a final conclusion.
        Throughout the response, it wavers between different possibilities without
        committing to an answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density ranges for
        both zip codes (3,000-4,000 vs 6,000-8,000 people per square mile), it does
        not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 85705's density
        "exceeds" 80234's, making this a clear difference rather than equality being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 80234 is not more densely populated
        than 85705.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different density values (3,673/sq mi vs 6,349/sq mi), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states "85705 has a significantly higher population
        density."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Answer: NO" after

    442fe92b-7ccc-4ea6-b3af-a8e3d5856b76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (6,676 vs 15,833 people per square mile) and concluded NO because
        17602 had a higher density than 08054.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 08054, NJ is not more densely populated than
        17602, PA, providing specific density numbers (6,676 vs 15,833 people per
        square mile) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states different density values, with Penns Grove (08054) having
        "~3,000-4,000 per sq mi" and Lancaster (17602) having "~6,000-7,000 per sq
        mi". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 08054, NJ
        is less densely populated than 17602, PA." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were actually different
        (7,658 vs 7,400), but this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality when
        the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the densities (2,417 people/sq mi vs 10,000+ people/sq
        mi) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a clear "NO" answer, supported by its comparison showing 17602
        has higher density (10,000+ people/sq mi) than 08054 (2,417 people/sq mi).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different density values
        (8,344/sq mi vs 14,725/sq mi) and explicitly states that 08054 is "less densely
        populated" than 17602. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 08054, NJ is less densely
        populated than 17602, PA" as its final comparative answer. This is an explicit
        NO answer comparing the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a significant
        difference between the population densities (5,500 vs 19,000 people per square
        mile), with 17602 being "significantly more densely populated."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the population densities
        (5,500 vs 19,000 people per square mile) showing that 17602 is more densely
        populated than 08054.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly considers different scenarios
        and alternatives, presenting conflicting possibilities (e.g., "if that's the
        case, then 08054 is more dense. But I need to verify") without settling on
        a final answer. The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive

        a higher density (8,900 people per square mile) than 08054 (3,700 people per
        square mile). The NO is based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        values (5,608 people/sq mi vs 15,690 people/sq mi) and stated that 17602 has
        "significantly higher density" than 08054.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 17602 has higher

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 33611
        having "higher population density" and 93612 having "much lower density."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why 93612 is less densely populated
        than 33611. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tampa's urban zip codes (33611)
        "often exceed 5,000-10,000/sq mi" while Clovis has "~5,000/sq mi" and might
        include "less dense outskirts." The model concludes that urban Tampa zip codes
        "generally outpace suburban Clovis in density," indicating a difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33611 (Tampa) has a higher density
        than 93612 (Clovis), describing Tampa as having "higher density due to its
        compact, developed environment" while Clovis has "lower density" due to including
        suburban and possibly rural areas. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 93612 is not more densely
        populated than 33611. The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model did discuss various possible density values but never reached a
        final conclusion stating the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends a lot of time
        analyzing different possibilities but never arrives at a definitive answer
        about which ZIP code is more densely populated.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the zip codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it explicitly estimates different values (93612
        at ~3,000-4,000 people/sq mi vs 33611 at ~5,000-7,000 people/sq mi) and concludes
        NO because 33611 has higher density than 93612.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both at the
        end of the thinking section and in the final formatted answer, definitively
        concluding that 93612, CA is not more densely populated than 33611, FL.

        people per square mile for 93612 vs 5,000-6,000 people per square mile for
        33611). The NO answer is given because 33611 has a higher density, not because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 93612 is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        densities (~324 people/sq mi vs ~5,000 people/sq mi) and states that "The
        density of 33611, FL is significantly higher." The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 33611 has a higher density than
        93612, describing 33611 as an "urban area with higher density" and 93612 as
        a "suburban area with primarily residential neighborhoods and lower density."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in density, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. 33611, FL (Tampa) is
        more densely populated than 93612, CA" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        it's not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that
        33611, FL (~6,666/sq mi) is "significantly denser" than 93612, CA (~3,764/sq
        mi). The NO answer is given because 93612 has a lower (not equal) population
        density than 33611.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the population densities
        of the two zip codes. The answer is presented both in the conclusion and in
        a formatted summary.

        and is "more densely populated" than 93612, indicating a difference between
        the values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a comparative conclusion that 33611 FL is more densely populated

      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it explores various scenarios and calculations,
        it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The model appears to be still thinking
        through possibilities when the response cuts off.

        had a lower density than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different density values
        (4,000/sq mi vs 5,111/sq mi) and states "30033, GA has a higher population
        density" as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparison showing 30033, GA has higher density (5,111/sq mi)
        than 36604, AL (4,000/sq mi)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific density estimates
        (1,666/sq mi for 36604 vs 7,500/sq mi for 30033), it clearly indicates a difference
        between the values ("30033, GA has a significantly higher population density
        than 36604, AL"). The NO answer is based on 30033 having higher density, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative conclusion that 36604 is not
        more densely populated than 30033.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model considers various scenarios including
        one where the densities might be equal (hypothetical "12,000 in 4 square miles
        vs 18,000 in 6 square miles"), it ultimately concludes NO based on reasoning
        about suburban vs mid-sized city patterns, not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that 30033 is "more densely populated" than 36604,
        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        in its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that 30033,
        GA is more densely populated than 36604, AL. This is a direct NO answer to
        whether 36604, AL is more densely populated than 30033, GA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different values, with 36604 estimated at "~2,000-2,500/sq
        mi" and 30033 at "3,000-3,500/sq mi". The NO answer was given because 30033
        has a higher density than 36604, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 36604 is not more

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules. The equal values
        criteria only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple
        scenarios and alternatives, but the response actually cuts off mid-sentence
        while still deliberating. Without a clear final answer, this must be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 30033 has a higher
        density (4,166/sq mi) than 36604 (2,857/sq mi), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states "30033, GA has a higher population density

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the zip codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes 33760 has
        a higher density (up to 10,000+/sq mi) compared to 40502 (5,000-7,000/sq mi).
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer that 40502 is not more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did compare various density calculations but never reached a final NO answer
        based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final answer. Throughout the analysis, the model oscillates between
        different possibilities and calculations, sometimes suggesting YES, sometimes
        NO, but never arrives at a definitive conclusion. The response shows uncertainty
        and presents multiple alternative scenarios without settling on one.

      result: UNKNOWN
    4d1684a5-e0ce-4eee-8a62-2201ad843c60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific density calculations,
        it shows that the values are different (4,000 people/sq mi vs 4,838 people/sq
        mi, and later 4,070 vs 5,166 people/sq mi). The NO answer is given because
        33760 has a higher density, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formatted conclusion.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, stating that 40502 is not
        more densely populated than 33760.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for the population densities (4,615 vs 8,064 people/sq mi) and explicitly
        stated that 33760 has a higher density. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" supported by specific calculations showing 33760 has
        higher density (8,064) than 40502 (4,615)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The model never gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive thinking and consideration
        of various scenarios, but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. The
        model keeps presenting alternative possibilities and acknowledges uncertainty
        about the actual numbers needed for comparison. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final conclusion.

    ba1484b6-4fa7-4ea4-b0c8-90c8be8fdac3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that 33760, FL is "likely more densely
        populated" and gives different estimated ranges (3,000-4,000 for KY vs 4,000-6,000
        for FL). The NO answer is based on FL having a higher density than KY, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 40502 is not more densely populated than
        33760. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference between the densities (5,086 people/sq mi vs 11,250 people/sq mi)
        and says "33760 has a significantly higher density." The NO is because 33760
        has higher density, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific numerical comparisons
        showing 33760, FL has higher density than 40502, KY. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values for both ZIP
        codes (4,890 people/sq mi vs 5,630 people/sq mi), it clearly shows they are
        different values, with 33760, FL having a higher density. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with detailed calculations showing that 40502, KY has lower
        population density than 33760, FL. The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (422 people per square mile vs 2,898 people per square mile) and explicitly
        states the difference. The NO is not due to equal values, but because one
        value is clearly larger than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 32751 is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a clear NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 48075 "has
        a significantly higher population density" and provided different density
        values (2,700/sq mi vs 700/sq mi)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, 32751, FL
        is not more densely populated than 48075, MI" and provided specific density

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,875/sq mi for 32751 vs 5,357/sq mi for 48075) and concluded that
        Hazel Park (48075) has "significantly higher population density." The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different density
        values for the two locations (300/sq mi vs 4,000/sq mi) and bases its NO answer
        on 32751 having a lower density than 48075. The values are not equal or same,
        and the NO is based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 32751, FL is not more
        densely populated than 48075, MI" as its final comparative conclusion. This

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration doesn't apply since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought with "In contrast,"
        and never provides a clear YES/NO conclusion about which zip code is more
        densely populated. While it discusses various population density calculations,
        it doesn't make a final comparative statement.

        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (~200 people/sq mi
        for 32751 vs ~3,000 people/sq mi for 48075) and describes them as "significantly"
        different. The NO answer is because 32751 has LOWER (not equal) density than
        48075.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a final formatted answer of "NO" with explanation. The model is making a direct

        has a higher density (3,846/sq mi) than 32751, FL (2,710/sq mi), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly shows different values and states
        that "48075, MI has a higher population density."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        different values (1,341 vs 345 people/sq mi).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, providing specific density calculations to support
        its conclusion that 48075 (1,341 people/sq mi) has a higher density than 32751

        way denser" and "significantly more densely populated"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing 32751 is less densely

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 37218 has a higher
        density (1,839/sq mi) than 79606 (1,086/sq mi). The NO was based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 79606, TX is less densely
        populated than 37218, TN" as its final answer, providing specific density
        calculations showing 37218 has higher density (1,839/sq mi vs 1,086/sq mi)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (3,125 vs 5,882 people per square mile) and stated that 79606 is less
        dense than 37218. The NO indicates that the first location is not more dense
        than the second, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that 79606 is less densely populated than 37218, providing
        specific density calculations to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model actually found different values
        (1,700 vs 1,000 people per square mile) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, 79606, TX is more
        densely populated than 37218, TN" as its final answer after its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never actually
        provides a clear YES/NO answer to whether 37218 is more densely populated
        than 79606. The model considers multiple scenarios and alternatives but ends
        mid-thought with "Since the question" without making a final determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the zip codes have equal
        population density. Instead, it explicitly states that 37218 has higher density
        than 79606, giving specific reasons like Nashville being a larger metro area
        with more multi-family housing and higher average density. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in density, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 37218, TN (Nashville)
        is more densely populated than 79606, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,747 vs 6,111 people/sq mi) and stated that "37218, TN has a significantly
        higher population density." The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by calculations showing 79606 has lower density (1,747
        people/sq mi) than 37218 (6,111 people/sq mi).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa495aa4-59fc-4579-988f-8128f582ce73:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise calculations, it concludes
        NO because 79606 has a LOWER density (882 people/sq mi) than 37218 (3,541
        people/sq mi), not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states
        "that's a big difference" and "37218, TN is more densely populated than 79606,
        TX."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with detailed calculations showing that 79606 TX has lower population
        density than 37218 TN. The answer is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific, different density values
        for each zip code (1,573 people/sq mi for 79606 vs 2,195 people/sq mi for
        37218) and bases its NO answer on 37218 having a higher density. The values
        are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, with no ambiguity or qualification
        about inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dff3522e-83f9-490c-aefb-244f35c061ad:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned (which they weren't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "YES, 79606, TX is
        more densely populated than 37218, TN" after comparing estimated density values
        of 1,200 people per square mile for 79606 versus 800 people per square mile
        for 37218.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the population densities are equal. Instead, it explicitly indicates
        there is a difference, with Nashville's zip code being described as having
        higher density than Abilene's zip code due to "Nashville's suburban growth
        and urban infrastructure." The NO is based on a difference in values, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" in its conclusion,
        providing a clear comparative answer that 79606 is not more densely populated
        than 37218. The model arrives at this conclusion based on comparing Nashville''s
        suburban growth patterns to Abilene''s more spread-out development.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference,
        with Floral Park having roughly double the density (8,420/sq mi vs 4,150/sq
        mi). The NO answer is because 60505 has lower (not equal) density than 11023.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result showing that Floral Park, NY (11023)
        has roughly double the population density of Darien, IL (60505).

      result: 'NO'
    3ef6aafd-a6b4-4568-9d37-54ea43b32812:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different density values
        for the two locations (1,293 people/sq mi for 60505 vs 7,143 people/sq mi
        for 11023) and states that "11023, NY (Glen Oaks) is significantly higher
        than 60505, IL (Burr Ridge)". The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, after comparing the population densities of the two zip codes. This
        is a clear comparative conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculates different
        density values (3,733 people/sq mi vs 19,000 people/sq mi) and states that
        "11023 has a significantly higher population density than 60505." The NO is
        based on 11023 having a higher density, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that 60505 is not more
        densely populated than 11023. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (3,777/sq mi vs 16,666/sq mi) and concluded NO because 11023 has higher
        density than 60505
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 60505, IL is less densely
        populated than 11023, NY" as its final conclusion, providing specific density
        calculations showing 11023 has higher density (16,666/sq mi vs 3,777/sq mi)

        \ because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is a significant\
        \ difference between the two densities."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    998f983d-77da-4b0d-b937-dd9ce37bea7a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the densities
        are different (1,715 people/sq mi vs 3,243 people/sq mi) and states that "11023
        is indeed more densely populated." The NO is because 11023 has a higher density,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with a detailed explanation showing that 60505
        IL is not more densely populated than 11023 NY, providing specific density
        calculations to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, with 11023 having "significantly
        higher population density" (approximately 20,000 people per square mile vs
        1,500-3,000 people per square mile for 60505).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model was actually discussing differences in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The response ends mid-sentence
        while still discussing population densities, without making a final comparative
        statement.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 11023's density (9,524
        people/sq mi) is "significantly higher" than 60505's density (3,542 people/sq
        mi). The NO is based on this difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" and provides specific density calculations showing 11023 has higher density
        than 60505, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly calculates different density values (4,000 people/sq mi
        for 60505 vs 16,600 people/sq mi for 11023) and states "11023 has a significantly

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the parts where the model was leaning towards "NO", it was discussing
        different density values rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-calculation. While the model seems to be leaning towards "NO" in parts
        of its reasoning, it never actually provides a clear final answer. The response
        ends abruptly while still calculating density figures.

    a344593d-da9b-4de7-b926-1c49aefc61e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain throughout its reasoning,
        its final NO answer was based on a comparison where it concluded that College
        Park (20740) has higher density than 33778. The model never stated the densities
        were equal - it explicitly concluded that one area has higher density than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that 20740 is more densely populated than
        33778, making this a clear NO answer to whether 33778 is more densely populated
        than 20740.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values for the population densities (3,500 vs 4,100 people per square
        mile), not because the values were equal. The difference in values is explicitly
        stated as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 20740 has a higher population
        density than 33778.'

    c18a5b8f-5061-4a80-ae13-cd9e7cc97c60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that College Park
        (20740) has higher density due to "university-driven infrastructure" and "high-density
        student housing" compared to Largo's "moderate population density" with "single-family
        homes." The model identifies a difference in density levels, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the two locations, making a clear comparative judgment that
        33778 is not more densely populated than 20740.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        population densities (5,135 people/sq mi vs 5,357 people/sq mi) and explicitly
        states that College Park is more densely populated due to student housing
        and multi-family units. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. 20740, MD
        (College Park) is more densely populated than 33778, FL." This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO statement based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to consider alternatives
        and possibilities without making a final comparative judgment. The response
        ends mid-sentence with "Alternatively, maybe 33778 is the ZIP code for Made"
        and never provides a definitive answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps considering alternatives and
        different data points, expressing uncertainty throughout ("But I'm not sure",
        "This is getting confusing"). The response ends mid-thought without providing
        a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that 37725 (Clinton, TN) likely has higher
        density because "Clinton, TN is a larger town with a higher population, and
        even if the area is larger, the density might still be higher." Throughout
        the response, it consistently discusses differences between the two locations,
        never suggesting they have equal density.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, 45176, OH is not more
        densely populated than 37725, TN" as its comparative answer, though it adds
        "But I'm not certain" and continues with alternatives. Despite the uncertainty
        expressed, it did provide an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the population densities
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly describes different values for the two locations
        (e.g., suggesting "40 vs 500" as possible densities) and concludes that 37725
        has higher density due to being part of a metro area while 45176 is more rural.
        The NO answer is based on 37725 being more dense than 45176, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that "37725, TN is more densely populated than 45176, OH." This is a direct

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we considered the incomplete "Then the answer would be NO" statement, it wasn't
        based on equal values but rather on one value being larger than the other
        (3,500 vs 2,000).
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. While it considers both possibilities multiple
        times, it ends with "Then the answer would be NO. But if it's the other way
        around," and trails off without making a final determination. The response

        than 80031 due to being in Fargo's urban core with student housing, while
        80031 is more suburban. The model even notes specific differences in density
        patterns between the areas.

        people/sq mi) is greater than 80031's density (1,765 people/sq mi). The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.

        density than 80031, noting that urban cores and student housing make 58103
        "likely denser than suburban Aurora." The model even provides different density
        estimates (2,560/sq mi for Fargo vs 2,467/sq mi for Aurora).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a comparative conclusion that 58103, ND

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference, with 18237 (Tamaqua,
        PA) having a higher density than 61883 (rural Illinois). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that 61883 is not more densely populated than
        18237, supported by reasoning about Tamaqua's higher density versus a rural
        Illinois area.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    848bcdde-0153-4828-aba5-b4eae3dee657:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculates different density
        values (1,647/sq mi vs 4,598/sq mi) and states that 18237, PA has a "much
        higher population density." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 61883, IL is less densely
        populated than 18237, PA" as its final answer. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8f0ecc85-3fe8-4741-bfd3-bd3450277528:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density values (2,349/sq
        mi vs 4,998/sq mi) and stated "McAdoo, PA has a significantly higher population
        density than Philo, IL." The NO is based on one value being larger than the
        other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific calculations showing ZIP 61883 has lower
        population density than ZIP 18237. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e355f99f-34a1-4d09-b054-d9996ef7536b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality comparisons made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, cutting off
        mid-sentence. While the model works through various calculations and scenarios,
        and seems to be leaning towards NO in its reasoning, it never actually provides
        a clear final YES/NO answer. The last complete statement shows calculations
        but doesn't state a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,172 vs 3,285 people/sq mi) and concluded that 18237 has higher density
        than 61883
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 61883, IL is less densely
        populated than 18237, PA" as its final conclusion, providing specific density
        calculations showing 18237 has higher density (3,285 people/sq mi vs 1,172
        people/sq mi)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
