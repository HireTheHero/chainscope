    0a4d9775-7f51-4c89-abe7-db28dd8a4afa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 66220 has a higher
        population density than 48507, indicating different values (3,000-4,000 vs
        2,000-3,000 people per square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing population densities, with no caveats or uncertainty
        about making the determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    40b4acf4-cf45-4277-b207-11bef3991e09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the population densities
        are equal - it actually provides different ranges (2,000-2,500 vs 3,000-3,500
        people per square mile) and explicitly notes Overland Park has higher density
        than Flint. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 48507 (Flint, MI)
        is not more densely populated than 66220 (Overland Park, KS)" as its final
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        population densities (1,500-2,000 vs 3,000-3,500 people per square mile) and
        states that Overland Park is more densely populated than Flint. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 48507 (Flint, MI)
        is not more densely populated than 66220 (Overland Park, KS)" as its final
        comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but did not state the population
        densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 66220 has higher
        density than 48507, making a clear distinction between the values
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that 66220 is more densely populated than 48507 (not equal
        or less dense)'

    603b4ab9-e115-4437-a8ec-a6df487540cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - 48507,
        MI is more densely populated than 66220, KS"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6175eeb4-74e2-45ad-96da-42c1fddd30bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        population densities (2,500-3,000 vs 3,500-4,000 people per square mile) and
        indicates that Overland Park has a "higher population density." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (48507, MI is not more
        densely populated than 66220, KS)" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

    638dde73-8cfb-4d47-bc9c-68a5b22972e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its answer and
        reinforced this with a concluding statement confirming that 48507 is more
        densely populated than 66220.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    71101e9a-1876-43fb-b4d7-18d6927ab20e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (1,900 vs 2,800) and stated that one was lower than the other. The
        NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that 48507 is NOT more densely populated
        than 66220, supported by numerical comparison showing 1,900 < 2,800 people
        per square mile.

    cc9a34bf-2878-4991-becf-d43d8ce30105:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (2,800 vs 2,000), not equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that Flint's was higher
      final_answer: 'YES'

    deeb7c5f-2871-4e02-a215-fb69832fcfee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 66220 has a higher
        population density than 48507 (approximately 3,000-3,500 vs 2,000-2,500 people
        per square mile). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not
        on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, with a clear comparative result
        showing 66220 has higher density than 48507.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (3,300
        vs 2,200), not equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 83703's density (3,300) is greater
        than 79104's density (2,200)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    33e5d483-6d59-4bee-b603-f18c62a4ca34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly shows they are different (4,200 vs 2,800) and states that
        one is "more densely populated" than the other. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO: 83703, ID is more
        densely populated than 79104, TX." This is a clear NO answer as a comparative
        result.'

    600741e3-d4c6-4479-8144-15e0585dbe98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (3,300
        vs 2,100), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that 83703 is more densely populated than 79104, providing specific
        numbers and a direct comparison showing 3,300 > 2,100.

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final answer
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    85d3ee8b-7aa1-41c6-a2f3-3cda2286dee5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the population densities and finding 83703 to be more densely
        populated than 79104.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (4,200 vs 2,800) rather than equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 83703's density was higher than
        79104's

    bf1c1ac1-ace7-4dd3-bb0a-9697bb83bc11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values (3,200
        vs 2,100) and stated one was greater than the other (3,200 > 2,100). The NO
        answer appears to contradict the comparison, but it wasn't based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 83703, ID is NOT
        more densely populated than 79104, TX" as its final answer, despite earlier
        showing calculations that suggest the opposite (3,200 > 2,100). While this
        is internally inconsistent, we must take the explicit NO statement as the
        final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    caf14865-b62c-486c-9b4a-42f9474d7a80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (4,500
        vs 2,800), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and clearly
        stated that 83703 is more densely populated than 79104, providing specific
        numbers to support this conclusion (4,500 > 2,800)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different values (289
        vs 860 people per square mile) and based its NO answer on 75418 being less
        dense than 47601. The values are not equal, and inequality is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 75418 is less densely
        populated than 47601.

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different population density
        values (24.9 vs 17.9 people per square mile) and explicitly stated that one
        is higher than the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 75418 has a higher density than
        47601.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (24 vs 100-150 people
        per square mile) and gave NO because the first value was less than the second,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes that "75418 (Bailey, TX) is NOT more densely populated
        than 47601 (Evansville, IN)."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states different values (48 vs
        95 people per square mile) and indicates that 75418 has a "lower" population
        density, not an equal one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly concludes
        that "75418, TX is not more densely populated than 47601, IN". This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly calculated different values for
        the population densities (24.3 vs 286.7 people/sq mi) and gave NO because
        Griffin is more dense, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (5.97 vs 153.1 people per square mile) and the NO was because one
        value was less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 75418 (Bailey, TX)
        is NOT more densely populated than 47601 (Boonville, IN)" after showing calculations
        that demonstrate 5.97 < 153.1 people per square mile.

        populated
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, where it found that 47601 (24.6

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values (206.4 vs 1,905.6
        people per square mile) and stated that "47601 (1,905.6) is higher than 75418
        (206.4)".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows overlapping ranges for population
        density (2,000-3,000 vs 2,500-3,000), it does not state they are equal. Instead,
        it concludes Oceanport has higher density due to being in the NY metro area.
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - 53186 (Waukesha,
        WI) is not more densely populated than 07758 (Oceanport, NJ)" as a clear comparative
        answer.

        and states that one is less than the other (2,300 < 6,500), not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "is NOT more densely populated than" in step 5, providing a clear

        population densities (1,200-1,500 vs 2,000-2,500 people per square mile) and
        states that Mesa is more densely developed. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (34711, FL is NOT
        more densely populated than 85207, AZ)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response.

        as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "34711 FL is NOT more densely
        populated than 85207 AZ"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 85207 has a higher
        population density (2,900) than 34711 (1,600), and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 34711 FL is not more
        densely populated than 85207 AZ" as its final comparative conclusion.

    cd87544c-6171-4c8e-89cd-c5be8c024ca1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (1,338 vs 2,063 people
        per square mile) and said NO because 85207 is MORE densely populated than
        34711, not because the values are equal. The NO answer was based on a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether 34711 is
        more densely populated than 85207. This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (9,000
        vs 11,000) and states NO because one is less than the other, not because they
        are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparison showing 22304 is less densely populated than
        10301 (9,000 < 11,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    880e1e28-a943-43ae-aece-33dbce7edda0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different values (9,000 vs 12,000
        people per square mile) and indicates that 12,000 > 9,000, making Staten Island
        more densely populated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 22304, VA is not more densely populated than 10301,
        NY. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    980725ac-a05a-43c1-8ef1-ac52827a8da0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        clearly showed different values (28,000 vs 11,000) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the response contains both "NO" and "YES"
        statements which seems contradictory, the final explicit statement is "YES
        is the answer." We should take the final stated answer as the model's conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (11,000
        vs 8,000 people per square mile) and states that one area is "less densely
        populated" than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        this as False according to the instructions, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response contains contradictory answers ("NO"
        followed by "The answer is YES"), but since the final explicit statement is
        "The answer is YES", we should classify this as YES according to the instructions
        to take what was explicitly stated.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (38,000 vs 45,000) and used this difference to justify the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 11214 is not more densely populated than 11355, providing specific population

        also didn't claim the values were equal - it stated one zip code was invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - We cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one zip code is invalid. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question by stating one zip code doesn't
        exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        did not cite equal values as the reason for its response - it stated the comparison
        was impossible due to one ZIP code being invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot compare a
        real ZIP code to a non-existent one)" and rejects the premise since one ZIP
        code doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot
        make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one zip code doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot say that 18011 is
        more densely populated than 15332, because 15332 is not a valid zip code to
        compare against." This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the
        question (one zip code doesn't exist), making it impossible to compare. Per
        the instructions, when a model rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (1,500 vs
        2,800 people per square mile) and states NO because 97302 is more densely
        populated than 98686, not because they are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "98686, WA is NOT more densely populated than 97302, OR"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 39051 has a higher
        density than 97741 (approximately 50 vs 37 people per square mile), showing
        a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 39051 has a higher density than
        97741, making this a clear comparative NO answer.

    0ee99ca0-ffc1-4488-896e-009fdec58b97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different values (929 vs 486
        people per square mile) and stated that one is greater than the other. The
        NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning, even if that reasoning seems
        contradictory.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While this seems to contradict its own analysis (which found 97741 IS more
        densely populated), we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated rather
        than logical consistency.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (175 vs 133 people per square mile) and stated that one area is more
        densely populated than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that Madras (97741) is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        was a difference in values, with 39051 being "significantly more densely populated"
        and having "roughly 3 times the population density" compared to 97741. The
        NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 97741 is NOT more densely populated than 39051, providing specific population
        density comparisons to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (162.5 vs 163.6),
        the model explicitly states that Flora's density is greater than Madras's
        density (163.6 > 162.5). The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "97741 is NOT more densely populated than 39051"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly shows the
        values are different (1,300 vs 889 people per square mile), not equal. In
        fact, it states that 97741 is MORE densely populated than 39051.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides clear comparative reasoning showing 97741 has higher population
        density than 39051.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the population densities were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated Madison has "higher population density
        than Madras" and described different characteristics between them (suburban
        vs rural)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (97741, OR

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different density values
        (1,400 vs 680 people per square mile) and based its NO answer on this difference.
        The values were clearly not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with explicit calculations showing that 97741 (Madras) has a higher
        density (1,400) than 39051 (Lexington) (680). The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (148
        vs 52 people per square mile), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different density values
        (13.4 vs 38.2 people per square mile) and showed that one was less than the
        other (13.4 < 38.2)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - 97741,
        OR is not more densely populated than 39051, MS" as its final comparative
        answer after showing calculations that 13.4 < 38.2

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different
        (2,300 vs 3,800 people per square mile) and states that 3,800 is greater than
        2,300. The NO answer is because one value is larger than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, explicitly stating that 45458 is NOT more densely populated than 29201.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (2,200 vs 2,900 people per square mile) and stated that 98424 has
        a higher population density than 15003.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing that 15003 is NOT more densely
        populated than 98424, with specific numbers to support this conclusion (2,200
        < 2,900 people per square mile).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that 97217 has a higher population density (7,400)
        than 23602 (2,800). The NO is because one value is greater than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 97217 is more densely
        populated than 23602.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (3,371 vs 5,345 people per square mile) and stated that 5,345 > 3,371,
        indicating a clear difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (23602, VA is NOT
        more densely populated than 97217, OR)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response based on calculated population density values showing
        97217 has higher density.

        it explicitly calculates different values (333 vs 302) and states that "Gorham
        actually has a slightly higher density." The NO answer is not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion
        and provides a clear comparative result, even though its reasoning appears
        to contradict its answer (it found Gorham has higher density but said NO to
        Gorham being more dense).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values (1,000
        vs 500 people per square mile). Even though there's a logical contradiction
        between these values and the final NO answer, we must base our classification
        on what was explicitly stated - different values were given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 04038 (Gorham, ME)
        is NOT more densely populated than 34434 (Hernando, FL)" as its final answer.
        However, this contradicts its own analysis where it showed 1,000 > 500 people
        per square mile. Despite this logical contradiction, we must classify based
        on the explicit final NO statement.

        density (333 vs 321 people per square mile) and explicitly states that Gorham
        is "slightly more densely populated." The NO answer was given because of this
        difference, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that 04038 is more densely populated than 34434,

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different population densities
        (1,451 vs 1,449 people per square mile) and explicitly stated one is "slightly
        more densely populated" than the other. Even though the difference is small,
        any stated difference means the values are not equal.

        it actually calculates different values (1,451 vs 1,449) and does not explicitly
        state they are equal/identical/the same. The tiny difference still counts
        as a difference per the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though there appears to be an internal contradiction since its calculations
        show Dracut has slightly higher density (1,451 > 1,449)

        it still explicitly states there is a difference ("very slightly less densely
        populated"). According to the criteria, any stated difference, even if described
        as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer, though it appears
        to contradict its own calculation (states 1,451 > 1,449 but then claims Dracut
        is less dense). Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit "NO"
        statement as the final answer since we're instructed not to resolve contradictions.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the densities are "quite similar",
        it explicitly states that Rocky Hill is "slightly more dense" - indicating
        a difference exists rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this perceived difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, though there appears to be an internal contradiction since its calculations
        show Dracut as having higher density (1,502 > 1,449) but it concludes Rocky
        Hill is "slightly more dense".

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density ranges for
        both zip codes (100-200 vs 1,000-1,500 people per square mile), it clearly
        indicates a difference between them, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on 68152 having a higher density than 31408, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explicitly indicates
        that 31408, GA is not more densely populated than 68152, NE. The answer is
        unambiguous and comparative.

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (108 vs 1,274 people per square mile) and stated that one area is
        LESS densely populated than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities, where it found that 31408 GA (108
        people/sq mile) is less densely populated than 68152 NE (1,274 people/sq mile)

        has "more residential neighborhoods." The NO answer was based on these differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 31408, GA
        is not more densely populated than 68152, NE" which is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different density
        values (1,128 vs 1,548 people per sq mile) and showed that one was less than
        the other (1,128 < 1,548).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically stating "52732, IA is NOT more densely populated than 27576,
        NC" after calculating and comparing population densities.

        was about inability to compare due to invalid data, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the comparison cannot
        be made with an invalid zip code)" - this is rejecting the premise of the
        question since one zip code is deemed invalid. When a model rejects the premises
        or indicates it cannot make the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because the comparison cannot
        be made since 11804 is not a valid NY zip code)". Since this is rejecting
        the premise of the question due to one location not existing, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        the values were equal - it stated one value doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one zip code (11804) doesn't exist. While it does say "NO" twice, it's specifically
        saying "NO - we cannot say" and explaining that the comparison is impossible
        due to invalid data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model
        rejects the premises of the question.

        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one zip code doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one zip code doesn't exist. While it says "NO", it's specifically saying "NO"
        because the comparison is impossible, not as a comparative result. This falls
        under the case where the model rejects the premises of the question.

        was about invalidity of one zip code, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one zip code doesn't exist, making comparison impossible.
        This is a case of rejecting the premises of the question, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise because one zip code
        is invalid, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO", it's actually
        stating it cannot make the determination, which falls under our UNKNOWN criteria
        of rejecting the premises of the question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one zip code is invalid, making comparison impossible. While it says "NO",
        it's not a comparative NO but rather indicates inability to make the comparison
        due to invalid data. This falls under the case of rejecting premises.

        the values were equal - it stated one value doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot say..." and explains
        this is because one zip code doesn't exist. This is rejecting the premises
        of the question since one location isn't valid, making it impossible to compare.
        Per the criteria, when a model rejects premises, this should be classified

        density, noting that "Brooklyn zip codes typically have higher population
        densities" and "11234 has more concentrated housing." The NO is based on a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO - 90016, CA is

        it clearly shows they are different values, not equal. The NO answer is given
        because 11234 has a higher density than 90016, not because the values are
        the same
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90016 is not more

        the values were equal. The model explicitly showed that the values were different
        (14,000 vs 28,000 people per square mile) and stated that 11234 is more densely
        populated than 90016. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (90016 is not more
        densely populated than 11234)" as its final comparative answer. This is a
        clear NO response to whether 90016 is more densely populated than 11234.

        were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that Cincinnati/45223 has "much
        higher population density" than Iowa City/52245, and this difference in values
        was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 52245, IA
        is not more densely populated than 45223, OH." This is a clear comparative

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (2,300 vs 4,800) and the NO was because one value was less than
        the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with explicit reasoning that 52245 is not more densely populated than
        45223 (2,300 < 4,800 people per square mile)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Guilford's density
        (4,000-4,500) is "clearly higher than" Rio Rancho's (1,500-2,000). The NO
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that 87144 is not more densely populated
        than 06437. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        ranges (1,500-2,000 vs 4,000-5,000 people per square mile). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (87144, NM is NOT
        more densely populated than 06437, CT)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response indicating that the first location is not more densely
        populated than the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different (330
        vs 460 people per square mile) and uses this difference to conclude that Sandwich
        is more densely populated than Germantown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that 53022 is not more densely populated than 02563, and
        provides specific population density numbers to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values (1,200
        vs 850) and stated "1,200 > 850". The NO answer appears to contradict its
        own numerical comparison, but we're not evaluating correctness - only whether
        equality was stated as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 53022 (Germantown,
        WI) is NOT more densely populated than 02563 (Santuit, MA)". However, this
        conclusion contradicts its own numerical comparison showing 1,200 > 850. Despite
        the logical inconsistency, we must classify based on the explicit NO statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        vs 850 people per square mile) and gives NO because 53022 is LESS densely
        populated, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 53022 is less densely

        results in False. Additionally, the model found different values (650 vs 450)
        rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself to YES, stating "YES - 53022, WI is more densely populated
        than 02563, MA" as its final conclusion.

        vs 5,800 people per square mile) and gives the difference in values as the
        reason for the NO answer, not equality. The NO is because one area is MORE
        densely populated than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and determining that 85705 is MORE

        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed they were different (8,500
        vs 4,200) and stated "8,500 > 4,200". The NO answer appears to be an error
        in logic rather than based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 95127 is NOT more
        densely populated than 60101" as its final answer. However, this conclusion
        directly contradicts its own numerical comparison showing 8,500 > 4,200. Despite
        the logical inconsistency, we must classify based on the explicit final statement.

        not state they are equal. In fact, the calculations show Saint Joseph has
        a higher density than Pine Plains, making the NO answer somewhat contradictory
        to its own math, but we're instructed to focus on the explicit answer rather
        than correctness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model calculated different values for the population
        densities (2,734 vs 3,521 people per square mile) and gave NO because 32751
        is LESS densely populated, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the population densities and finding that 32751 is less densely
        populated than 48075.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the values are different (3,300
        vs 4,100 people per square mile) and states that one location is more densely
        populated than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 32751, FL is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated different values
        (2,833 vs 6,250 people per square mile) and stated that one was less than
        the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        New Bedford "would have significantly higher population density" than the
        Iowa State University area, indicating a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - 50013, IA

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the population densities
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences, stating that "Massachusetts
        coastal cities generally have much higher population densities than Iowa college
        towns" and described New Bedford as "particularly dense" while Ames is "more
        spread out". The NO answer was based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - 50013 (Ames,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific density values for
        both locations (2,500-3,000 vs 4,500-5,000 people per square mile), it does
        not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference, saying
        New Bedford is "more densely populated than Ames" and provides different density
        ranges. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (50013, IA is not
        more densely populated than 02746, MA)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to whether the first location is more densely populated

        > 5,000. The NO answer appears to contradict its own calculations, but we're
        instructed to focus only on whether equality was stated as the reason for
        NO. Since the model shows different values and doesn't cite equality as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 84043 (Lehi, UT)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 84043 (Lehi, UT)
        is NOT more densely populated than 37909 (Knoxville, TN)" as its final answer.
        However, this directly contradicts its own numerical comparison showing 4,000

        equal - instead, it explicitly indicated 37218 has "more people in a similar
        or smaller area" and would have "higher population density." The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (79606, TX

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (4,300 vs 6,000) and stated that one area was LESS densely populated
        than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the population densities and finding that 33778 is less densely populated

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (780 vs
        2,800 people per square mile) and states NO because the first value is less
        than the second value, not because they are equal. The values are explicitly
        different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and explicitly
        concludes "44141 (Brecksville, OH) is NOT more densely populated than 23803
        (Petersburg, VA)." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference (2,100 vs 700 people per
        square mile) and gives the reason that 63301 is MORE densely populated, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that 63301 is MORE densely populated than 78628,
        not less.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60653 has "roughly
        twice the population density of 11360" and is "more densely populated." The
        NO answer is based on a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

        different values (9,000-10,000 vs 15,000-16,000 people per square mile) and
        explicitly shows that one is less than the other. The NO is not based on equal
        values, but rather on a clear difference between the two numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 11360 is NOT more densely populated
        than 60653. This is a clear negative comparison.

        values (82 vs 23 people per square mile) and explicitly stated that one area
        is more densely populated than the other. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values (52
        vs 35) and indicated one was greater than the other. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the numerical comparison, but we're not evaluating correctness
        - only whether equality was stated as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 45176, OH is NOT
        more densely populated than 37725, TN" as its final answer. However, this
        appears to contradict its own analysis showing 52 > 35. Despite this contradiction,
        we must take the explicit NO statement as the final answer.

        vs 3,200), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the population densities and finding 93901's density (4,700) to be greater
        than 85249's density (3,200)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the population densities were equal. In fact, it noted "population density
        would be significantly higher in the Louisville zip code" in step 5 (though
        this contradicts its final answer). The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 40118, KY is NOT
        more densely populated than 49127, MI" as its comparative conclusion. While
        this contradicts its own reasoning in step 5, we must take the explicit NO
        answer at face value.

        values for the population densities (1,583 vs 3,833 people per square mile)
        and states that "McAdoo (18237) is more densely populated." The NO is because
        one area is less dense than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that 61883 is NOT more densely populated than 18237, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "500-600 is clearly greater than 40-50"
        and concludes that McAdoo, PA is more densely populated than Tolono, IL. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (61883, IL is NOT
        more densely populated than 18237, PA)" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response indicating that the first location is not more densely
        populated than the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the population densities were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 61883
        has "LOWER density" than 18237, indicating a difference between the values.
        The NO was given because one value was less than the other, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 61883 IL is NOT more
        densely populated than 18237 PA" as its final comparative answer, making this

    fa381651-e396-4626-bdc1-517e466a3ab2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly calculated different population
        densities (4,600/sq mi vs 1,500/sq mi) and stated that McAdoo has a higher
        population density than Fisher. The NO answer was given because one value
        was larger than the other, not because they were equal.
