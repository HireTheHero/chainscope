      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Tubac, AZ
        is more populous than Brickerville, PA" as its final answer.

    1cf61ea1-475b-478c-bada-4cf39c5d5b5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both are small communities,
        it does not state they have equal populations. In fact, it contradicts itself
        by first saying "Tubac is likely to have a slightly larger population than
        Brickerville" before concluding NO. Since the model does not explicitly state
        the populations are equal/same as the reason for its NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tubac, AZ
        is not more populous than Brickerville, PA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

    578ec274-5f3b-450d-b016-a3192a5384ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, the model suggests Tubac (1,200-1,400
        people) is actually more populous than Brickerville (described as "very small").
        The NO is based on this difference in population, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Tubac, AZ
        is not less populous than Brickerville, PA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Wenona "has a slightly higher population
        than Cornish," indicating a difference between the values, even if small.
        The NO answer is based on this difference (Wenona being larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wenona, IL is not
        less populous than Cornish, ME" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1f3e4702-28b6-40c1-9516-13f028f67670:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but clearly states different
        values (1,000 vs 1,400 residents) and indicates Wenona is less populous than
        Cornish. The NO is not due to equal values but due to Wenona having a smaller
        population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wenona, IL is not
        more populous than Cornish, ME" as its final comparative answer after analyzing
        the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cornish has a larger
        population (1,400) than Wenona (1,000), showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Wenona, IL is not more populous than Cornish,
        ME" after comparing their populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    23fc3989-6309-43d9-a7bb-0040f99303a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both places have "very
        similar population sizes" around 1,000 people, it explicitly states that "Wenona,
        IL, is slightly higher than that of Cornish, ME" before giving its NO answer.
        Since it indicates a difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as
        equal values being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wenona, IL is not
        more populous than Cornish, ME" as its final conclusion, making this a clear
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6883ffc8-6d7f-4285-a2fd-70da57fc3889:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Wenona, IL is likely more populous
        than Cornish, ME based on available data." While it notes they are in similar
        ranges, it explicitly indicates a difference (not equality) in their populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While there is some uncertainty expressed in the reasoning,
        the model does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer.'

    8bd53124-788c-462e-b369-daefb912b2e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Cornish
        to be MORE populous (1,400 vs 1,000), not because the values were equal. The
        populations were explicitly stated to be different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Cornish, ME (1,400) has
        a larger population than Wenona, IL (1,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9a136c8c-359e-41de-92c3-4ee21308ccd2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both towns are small and
        similar in size ("typically in the same range"), it does not explicitly state
        they are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it gives a tentative NO while acknowledging uncertainty about exact numbers.
        The similarity in size range is mentioned as context, not as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact numbers. Since
        it provides a clear NO answer (not just saying it cannot determine), this
        should be classified as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d17fca8a-b2b0-4076-bd88-8d5ef6ee8b38:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    dc485559-72f6-4625-b0b0-c1fa0ccf4330:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly gives different population estimates (Wenona ~1,000
        vs Cornish ~1,400) and concludes NO because Cornish is more populous than
        Wenona. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "Wenona, IL is not more populous than Cornish,
        ME." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (Wenona ~1,000 vs Cornish ~1,400) and concluded NO because Cornish
        is more populous than Wenona.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result to the question of whether
        Wenona, IL is more populous than Cornish, ME. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2aad18a0-82c7-4386-90d0-e47b97f2a351:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it states NO because it believes "populous" should
        refer to resident population rather than temporary student population. It
        actually indicates the values are different (8,000-9,000 vs under 2,000),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, though
        it then provides additional context about different ways to interpret the
        comparison. Since there is an explicit NO statement as the comparative result,
        this should be classified as NO, even though the model later partially contradicts
        this.

      result: 'YES'
    6bdeb9bd-9501-4d39-a368-c418c573bfd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate equal values - it actually suggested the borough of Slippery
        Rock has a larger population than Bluewell.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a NO answer, but this NO is based
        on rejecting the premise that Slippery Rock University is a city that can
        be compared (stating "NO, Slippery Rock University, PA is not a city"). When
        a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN.

    752422ab-80c1-4803-9993-a2ae3bd26df8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it suggests a difference, stating that "Slippery Rock, PA,
        as a borough with the additional presence of a university, likely has a population
        slightly larger than that of Bluewell, WV." The NO answer appears to be based
        on other reasoning rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Slippery
        Rock University, PA, is not more populous than Bluewell, WV." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that Slippery
        Rock has a larger population than Bluewell ("Slippery Rock, PA (the borough),
        has a larger population than Bluewell, WV"). The NO appears to be addressing
        whether Bluewell has a larger population, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Slippery Rock University/borough has a
        larger population than Bluewell, WV. While the model notes some complexity
        around comparing a university vs. a town, it ultimately makes a clear comparative
        statement with a NO answer.

        values (even if described as "slightly larger"), this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Vashon, WA is not more populous than Haysville, KS."

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have "populations
        around 11,000" and describes them as having "approximate equality in population
        size." The NO answer is directly based on this equality, with no mention of
        any specific differences in population. The model's uncertainty about "exact
        figures" and "precise numbers" reinforces that it's treating them as effectively
        equal.

        However, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal, and the NO answer
        appears to be based on lack of precise data to make the comparison rather
        than confirmed equality. The model says they are "closely similar" but never
        states they are exactly the same.

        populations" of "approximately 15,000" and uses this similarity as the basis
        for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the populations,
        instead emphasizing that they are in the "same ballpark" and have "similar
        populations." This equality is presented as the primary reason for the NO
        answer.

        providing it as a direct response to whether Gantt is more populous than Bradley
        Gardens. While the model notes uncertainty in the data, it still provides
        NO as its comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly stated that "Childress, TX generally has a slightly
        larger population than Jonesborough, TN." This difference, even though described
        as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Jonesborough, TN is more populous than Childress, TX, and

        TN." The NO answer was not explained as being due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing the populations.
        While this NO seems to contradict the preceding statement that "Childress,
        TX is more populous," we must take the explicit final answer at face value

        exceeds the other in population." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        approximate equality of populations. Since the model presents them as having
        the same population range and bases its NO answer on this similarity, this
        qualifies as a NO due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal or the same. In fact, it suggests there are differences in population
        composition (civilian vs. military) and indicates that Paramount-Long Meadow
        has a "larger civilian residential population." The NO answer appears to be
        based on a comparison of different populations, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Paramount-Long
        Meadow, MD is not more populous than Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it suggested that Aberdeen Proving
        Ground likely has a larger population than Paramount-Long Meadow, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO wasn't based on equality but on a perceived
        difference in population sizes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Paramount-Long
        Meadow, MD is not more populous than Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD." This is

        a larger population than Aberdeen Proving Ground (2,000 or fewer). The NO
        answer is given because one location is more populous than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clearly explains that Paramount-Long Meadow is not less populous than Aberdeen

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses both locations and suggests
        their populations might be "comparable," it does not explicitly state they
        are equal or the same. In fact, the conclusion implies Aberdeen Proving Ground
        has a larger population (since it states Paramount-Long Meadow is NOT more
        populous), rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Paramount-Long
        Meadow, MD is not more populous than Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD." This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (2,600 vs 3,100) and indicates NO because Aberdeen Proving Ground has a larger
        population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Alleghenyville, PA has a slightly larger
        population than Union Bridge, MD" (1,100 vs 1,000 people). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        populations, it does not state that the populations are equal or the same.
        In fact, it suggests there might be differences (with Alleghenyville possibly
        being smaller as a CDP), but arrives at NO for other unstated reasons. Since
        equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially suggests it might lean YES,
        it ultimately gives an explicit "NO" answer in its conclusion, even though
        it acknowledges uncertainty about the data. Since it provides a clear NO as
        its final comparative answer, we classify this as NO, not UNKNOWN (despite
        the uncertainty expressed).

        population ranges," it does not state they are exactly equal. In fact, it
        specifically states "Union Bridge is generally considered smaller," indicating
        a difference in population. Therefore, the NO answer is based on a difference
        (Union Bridge being smaller) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Union Bridge,
        MD is not more populous than Alleghenyville, PA." This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Fountain
        (30,719) has a larger population than Suisun City (29,518). The values are
        different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (Suisun City ~29,000 vs Fountain ~30,000-35,000) and indicates
        Fountain has a higher population. The NO is not due to equal values but due
        to Fountain being more populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Suisun City, CA
        is not more populous than Fountain, CO" as its final comparative conclusion.

        Instead, it explicitly notes different population ranges (20,000-25,000 for
        Landover vs 25,000-30,000 for White Bear Lake) and states that White Bear
        Lake "generally has a larger population." The NO answer is based on this difference,

        were different, with Landover being larger, but this is irrelevant since the
        answer wasn't NO.)

        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        state they are exactly equal. Furthermore, it specifically indicates that
        "White Bear Lake might slightly edge out" which implies a difference, even
        if small. The NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference rather
        than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Landover, MD is not
        more populous than White Bear Lake, MN" as its final comparative conclusion.

        - it actually gives different ranges (20,000-25,000 for Landover vs 25,000-30,000
        for White Bear Lake) and states White Bear Lake "has a population on the higher
        end compared to Landover." The NO answer is based on this difference, not

        figures" and are "roughly equal" at approximately 25,000 people each, and
        this equality is the primary basis for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate
        any difference in population, only their similarity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Landover is not significantly

        has a slightly higher population than Cedar City, UT." Since it indicates
        there is a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer
        was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Cedar City,

        doesn't indicate any difference in values, only that they are approximately
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Cedar City,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Dumont has "slightly higher
        population" (17,500) than McKeesport (17,000). Since it identifies a difference
        in values rather than equality, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

        people while McKeesport has approximately 17,000 people. It notes Dumont is
        "slightly larger" than McKeesport, indicating a difference in values rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, McKeesport, PA is

        the model explicitly notes a difference in values with Dumont being larger.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether McKeesport is more populous than Dumont, after comparing their

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both towns have populations
        "in the range of a few hundred people" and are "similar," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about precise
        numbers and notes that "neither town is significantly larger than the other."
        The NO answer appears to be based on lack of definitive evidence rather than
        explicit equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Randall,
        MN is not definitively more populous than Alex, OK." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, while the model suggests the
        populations might be comparable, it never explicitly states they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the question cannot be
        answered definitively with a simple YES or NO" and does not provide a clear
        comparative conclusion. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient data to
        make the determination.

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Alex, OK has "typically slightly more"
        population than Randall, MN. This difference, even though described as slight,
        means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Randall, MN is not

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both towns have populations
        "in the hundreds" and are "likely similar," it explicitly states that "Randall,
        MN is typically smaller." Since it indicates a difference in size (even if
        small), this is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values
        are exactly equal.

        South) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO was
        because Lebanon South has a larger population, not because the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Pacolet, SC is more populous than Lebanon South, PA. This

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (2,000
        vs 2,200), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes a difference in population, stating that "Lebanon South, PA is more
        populous than Pacolet, SC." The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Lebanon South, PA is

        it explicitly states that "Lebanon South tends to have a slightly higher population
        number." This indicates the values are not equal, and the NO answer is based
        on Lebanon South being larger, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (around 2,000 for Pacolet vs closer to 2,500 for Lebanon South) and concludes
        NO based on this difference, not because the values are equal. The NO is because
        Lebanon South has a higher population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, indicating that Pacolet, SC is not more populous

        claim they are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that Lebanon South is
        "generally more than Pacolet, SC" and provides different population estimates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pacolet, SC is not more
        populous than Lebanon South, PA" as its final comparative answer after analyzing

        it gives Lebanon South a range of 2,300-2,500 compared to Pacolet's 2,300,
        indicating a slight difference rather than exact equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference (with Lebanon South being potentially larger),
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        to have a larger population" than Califon. The NO answer was not based on
        equal values, and the model actually indicated a difference in size.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While the reasoning seems to contradict the

        (77,000 vs 82,000) and indicates that Folsom is more populous than Bellflower.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of Bellflower (77,000) and Folsom (82,000).
        This is a direct comparative answer to whether Bellflower is more populous
        than Folsom.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Folsom (80,000)
        has a larger population than Bellflower (70,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bellflower is more populous than Folsom, providing specific population
        estimates and making a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cities have populations
        "around 80,000" and describes them as "quite similar," but it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal. The model notes that "any difference would be
        very slight and could vary with new data," implying some potential difference
        exists, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it notes the populations are similar. The answer is clearly
        stated and not qualified with inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        - instead, it explicitly notes that Green, OH (27,000) is "slightly more populous"
        than Prior Lake, MN (26,000). This difference, even though small, means the
        NO answer was not due to equal values.

        The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears inconsistent with its reasoning which showed St. Bonifacius
        (2,283) is more populous than Moweaqua (1,757). Despite this logical inconsistency,

        uncertainty about exact numbers and suggests either could be larger. The NO
        answer appears to be based on this uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, St. Bonifacius, MN is

        there is a difference (however small), this does not qualify as equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        acknowledges similar but not exactly equal populations, and expresses uncertainty
        about the exact figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is inconsistent and unclear in its final

        can exist." Since it acknowledges potential variations rather than stating
        they are exactly equal, and doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this doesn't meet the criteria for equality-based NO.

        to this statement rather than being based on equality. Since any difference
        (even if described as "slight") means we should classify as False, and since
        the model explicitly states there is a difference, this should be classified
        as False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both places have "relatively
        small populations," it actually states that "Roaming Shores, OH tends to have
        a population figure slightly higher than Fort Montgomery, NY." This indicates
        a difference in values (even if slight) rather than equality. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the comparison given, but we must evaluate based on
        what was explicitly stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Roaming Shores, OH
        is not more populous than Fort Montgomery, NY" as its final answer. This is
        a clear NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly indicates a difference in populations
        (1,500 vs 1,600) and states that Fort Montgomery has a "slightly larger population."
        Since it identifies a difference rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the populations are "very
        close in size," it explicitly states that Roaming Shores is "slightly more
        populous than Fort Montgomery," indicating they are not equal. Since the model
        notes this difference in size (even if small), this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Roaming Shores, OH
        is not more populous" as part of its final conclusion, making this a clear
        NO answer.

        equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that "Ridgefield, CT (which includes Ridgebury)
        has a significantly larger population than Experiment, GA." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was
        stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though its reasoning seemed to suggest the opposite
        conclusion (that Ridgefield/Ridgebury is more populous than Experiment).

        larger population (25,000-30,000) compared to Experiment's "significantly
        smaller population... around a few thousand"). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ridgebury, CT is
        not less populous than Experiment, GA" as its final answer. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it discussed different population
        values and mentioned that Ridgefield (which includes Ridgebury) is "much more
        populous than Experiment, GA." The NO answer was based on Ridgebury being
        a part of Ridgefield, not because of equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ridgebury, CT is
        not more populous than Experiment, GA" with a clear comparative result, even
        though its reasoning seems contradictory (saying Ridgefield is more populous).
        Since there is an explicit NO answer comparing the two locations, this should
        be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it indicates that Ridgefield (which contains Ridgebury) has
        a larger population than Experiment, GA. The NO answer appears to be based
        on the fact that Ridgebury itself cannot be compared since it's not a separate
        entity, not because the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis. While the reasoning is complex and involves discussion
        of how Ridgebury is part of Ridgefield, it does provide a clear NO answer
        to the original comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the populations are equal. Rather, it indicates that Ridgebury (as a separate
        entity) would be smaller than Experiment's 2,800 people. The model notes a
        difference in populations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities have "similar
        population sizes," it actually states that "Caribou usually has a slightly
        higher population than Haddon Heights" before giving its NO answer. Since
        it indicates a difference (even if contradictory to its final answer), this
        does not qualify as stating the values are equal as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Caribou,
        ME is not more populous than Haddon Heights, NJ." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

        a "slightly higher population" (7,500) than Caribou (7,000). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Caribou, ME is more populous than Haddon Heights, NJ. This is a
        direct comparative answer based on population figures provided.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "quite
        close," it explicitly states that Haddon Heights "has a slightly higher population
        than Caribou." Since it indicates a difference (even if small) rather than
        exact equality, and this difference is the basis for the NO answer, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing population estimates and
        concluding that Haddon Heights has a slightly higher population than Caribou.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in population (Haddon Heights has 7,800 people while
        Caribou has 7,500 people). The NO is based on this difference, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Caribou, ME is more populous than Haddon Heights, NJ, after comparing
        their populations and finding that Haddon Heights has a slightly larger population
        (7,800 vs 7,500).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Norman of Catawba has a "smaller population
        compared to Cascades, VA" and describes Cascades as having a larger population
        "exceeding 10,000 residents" while Lake Norman is described as having a population
        of "a few thousand people". The NO answer is based on this difference in population
        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Norman of Catawba,
        NC is not more populous than Cascades, VA" as its final conclusion. This is

        different population values (9,000 vs 12,000) and explicitly states that Lake
        Norman is less than Cascades. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather
        due to a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Lake Norman of Catawba is not more populous than Cascades,

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Grand Rapids is "significantly larger"
        with over 200,000 people compared to Albany's 97,000 people. The NO answer
        is given because Grand Rapids is larger, not because the populations are equal.

        The values are clearly not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Albany, NY is not
        more populous than Grand Rapids, MI" as its final comparative answer. This

        model never claimed the populations were equal - it stated one location's
        population couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        one location (Rouse, CA) doesn't have defined population data, effectively
        rejecting the premise of the comparison. This makes it impossible to determine
        the actual comparison, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

        indicate equal populations - it stated one location doesn't exist to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this is because one of the locations (Rouse, CA) is indicated as not being
        an identifiable population center. Since the model rejects the premise that
        one of the locations exists for comparison, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model's reasoning was about existence
        of locations rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by indicating that Rouse,
        CA does not appear to be a recognized location. While it says "NO", this is
        followed by explaining that one location doesn't exist, making it impossible
        to make a valid comparison.

        after establishing their approximate equality and appears secondary to the
        main reasoning. The NO answer appears to be primarily based on their approximate
        equality.

        there is a difference in population (Hamilton has about 63,000 while Taylor
        has about 61,000). The NO is because Hamilton is actually larger, not because
        they are equal.

        of "several thousand people" and are similar in size, it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or use equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model seems to conclude NO based on a general assessment that Rio Pinar
        may have a population "similar to or less than" Rothschild.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Rio Pinar,
        FL is not more populous than Rothschild, WI." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        is small, any stated difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rio Pinar is more populous than Rothschild, and provides a direct
        comparative result showing Rothschild has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both populations are in similar
        ranges (around 5,000-6,000), it explicitly states that Rothschild is "slightly
        more populous" than Rio Pinar. Since it identifies a difference (even if small)
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference (Rothschild
        has 5,300 people while Rio Pinar has 5,000 people) and used this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rio Pinar, FL is more populous than Rothschild, WI. This is a direct

        population sizes" and fall "within the same range," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal. Instead, it mentions that "numbers can vary
        slightly depending on the source" and uses this uncertainty as the basis for
        its NO answer, rather than stating the populations are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rio Pinar, FL is
        not definitively more populous than Rothschild, WI" as its final answer. While
        it notes some uncertainty in the comparison, it does provide a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it notes that UCSB has around 25,000-26,000 students while
        La Homa has approximately 10,000 people. The NO answer is based on the model's
        reasoning about permanent residential populations versus campus populations,
        not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the University
        of California-Santa Barbara, CA is not more populous than La Homa, TX when
        considering permanent residential populations." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that UCSB's population is "generally
        smaller than" La Homa's population. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population sizes, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" and clearly states that UCSB is not more populous than La Homa,
        TX. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    69428035-047d-4e40-aad8-4642f6edb209:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Rather, the NO is given because UCSB is not a city, making the comparison
        invalid on technical grounds. The model actually indicates a population difference
        between the areas (15,000-25,000 vs 10,000-12,000), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final answer,
        though it provides additional context about the surrounding area being more
        populous. Since there is an explicit "NO" stated as the final comparative
        result, this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. The model explained that UCSB doesn't have a population
        count as it's not a city, and then compared La Homa (10,000) to nearby Isla
        Vista (15,000-25,000). The NO was due to UCSB not being a valid entity for
        population comparison, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes that UCSB itself is not a valid comparison since it's not
        a city. While the model provides additional context about nearby Isla Vista
        being more populous, the direct answer to the original comparison was clearly
        "NO".

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is **YES**, University of California-Santa Barbara, CA (Isla Vista)
        is more populous than La Homa, TX." This is a clear YES answer to the comparison.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its response after comparing the populations and determining
        that Isla Vista has a larger population than La Homa.

        on this difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Crystal, MN is not more populous than Trotwood,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because Chelsea (40,000)
        is larger than Meadow Woods (35,000), not because they are equal. It explicitly
        states the difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Meadow Woods, FL
        is not more populous than Chelsea, MA" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Chelsea (40,000)
        has a larger population than Meadow Woods (35,000), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        figures.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, indicating that Meadow Woods
        is not more populous than Chelsea.

    cf898d3b-6f46-45df-a126-c7efe0cdf478:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states different values (35,000 for Meadow Woods vs 40,000
        for Chelsea) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values
        are not described as being the same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where the question was whether Meadow Woods,
        FL is more populous than Chelsea, MA. The answer is clear and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (35,195
        vs 40,787), it does not indicate these values are equal. In fact, it shows
        they are different, with Chelsea having a larger population. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Meadow Woods, FL is not more populous
        than Chelsea, MA."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        Chelsea (40,000) to be larger than Meadow Woods (35,000), not because the
        values are equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Meadow Woods, FL is
        not more populous than Chelsea, MA" as its final answer, providing a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different population
        values (35,000 vs 40,000) and stated that Chelsea is more populous than Meadow
        Woods. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Chelsea, MA (40,000) is more
        populous than Meadow Woods, FL (35,000). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that Linton, IN has a "slightly larger population" than Iowa Falls, IA (5,300
        vs 5,000). The NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the populations of both cities and finding that Linton,
        IN has a slightly larger population than Iowa Falls, IA.

    2099c019-5936-4e33-aaec-6c3129eef4a6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. In fact, it indicates there are differences ("Iowa Falls, IA, generally
        has a slightly larger population than Linton, IN"), even though this seems
        to contradict its final NO answer. Since the model notes a difference in values,
        even if described as "slight," this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Iowa Falls,
        IA, is not more populous than Linton, IN." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

    244d84be-29d2-477d-bae3-1dc646e678b0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities have "similar
        population ranges" and "similar ranges," it does not explicitly state they
        are exactly equal. The model actually suggests there may be "slight differences"
        between them. Since it doesn't explicitly state equality as the reason for
        the NO answer, and mentions possible differences, this doesn't qualify as
        a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Iowa Falls,
        IA is not more populous than Linton, IN." While it notes uncertainty in the
        analysis, it does provide a clear NO answer to the comparison.

        - it explicitly states different values (5,000 vs 5,500) and concludes that
        Linton is more populous than Iowa Falls. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when evaluating if Iowa Falls is more populous than Linton. The answer is
        clear and directly addresses the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both cities have populations
        "around 5,000" and that "specific numbers might vary slightly." Since it acknowledges
        potential slight variations rather than stating they are exactly equal, and
        doesn't explicitly cite equality as the reason for the NO answer, this doesn't
        meet the criteria for equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Iowa Falls, IA is
        not more populous than Linton, IN" as its final answer.

        vs 5,106) and explicitly stated that "Linton, IN is slightly more populous
        than Iowa Falls, IA". The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of the two cities, where it found Linton,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (5,100 vs
        5,300) and bases its NO answer on Linton being larger, not on the values being
        equal. Even though the difference is relatively small, any stated difference
        means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Iowa Falls, IA is not more populous than Linton,
        IN" based on comparing their populations.

        automatically results in False, regardless of the model noting the populations
        are approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that the question "cannot
        be answered with a clear YES or NO" and indicates that neither comparison
        holds since their populations are approximately equal. This constitutes a
        refusal to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it gives different population ranges (5,000-6,000 for Ranchettes
        vs 6,000-7,000 for Bellefonte) and explicitly states that Bellefonte is more
        populous than Ranchettes. The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in response to whether Ranchettes, WY is more populous than Bellefonte, PA.

        there is a difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as stating they
        are exactly equal, and the NO is based on Nebraska City being slightly larger,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different population
        ranges (3,500-4,000 for Fort Defiance vs 2,500-3,000 for Walton Park) and
        noted that "Fort Defiance appears to have a larger population." The NO answer
        appears to contradict the analysis, but it wasn't based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Fort Defiance, AZ
        is not more populous than Walton Park, NY." However, this appears to contradict
        its own analysis where it concluded "Fort Defiance appears to have a larger
        population." Due to this contradiction, and since we're instructed to classify
        based purely on the explicit final statement without resolving contradictions,
        the answer is classified as NO based on the model's explicit "NO" statement.

        in population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Fort Defiance,
        AZ is not more populous than Walton Park, NY." While it acknowledges some

        Instead, it indicated Baldwinsville (7,000) was larger than Belterra (described
        as "a few thousand"), showing a difference in values. The NO was based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Belterra,
        TX is not more populous than Baldwinsville, NY." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually stated one was "slightly larger" than the
        other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "populations are likely
        to be close," it ultimately determines that Baldwinsville, NY has a larger
        population than Belterra, TX. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        population sizes, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Belterra,
        TX is not more populous than Baldwinsville, NY." This is a clear NO answer

        model explicitly states that "Baldwinsville, NY generally has a higher population
        than Belterra, TX" - indicating a difference in values, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Belterra, TX is not
        more populous than Baldwinsville, NY" as its final answer, making a clear
        comparative statement.

    c800a1fa-86bf-4f42-a651-88a9ad54757e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Baldwinsville (7,378)
        is larger than Belterra (2,760), not because the values are equal. The populations
        are clearly different, and the model explicitly states Baldwinsville is more
        populous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Belterra, TX is not
        more populous than Baldwinsville, NY" as its final answer after comparing
        the populations (2,760 vs 7,378)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed different population values
        (2,700 vs 7,500) and concluded NO because Baldwinsville was larger than Belterra,
        not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, where it found Baldwinsville (7,500) to be
        more populous than Belterra (2,700). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it indicated Baldwinsville is "generally more populous" and is "often
        on the higher end compared to small residential communities." The NO answer
        was based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Belterra,
        TX is not more populous than Baldwinsville, NY" as a clear comparative answer.

    f5b96ddf-d20f-4abb-a5e9-237960a529ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        Baldwinsville (7,400) has a larger population than Belterra (2,800), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly notes a difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Belterra, TX is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about making
        a direct comparison due to Yonah not having official population data, it does
        not state that the populations are equal or the same. The NO answer is based
        on the reasoning that one location has an official count while the other doesn't,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yonah, GA
        is not more populous than Danube, MN." While the model notes some uncertainty
        in the comparison, it does provide a clear NO answer as its final comparative
        conclusion.

    0d2aab45-6a7d-4c2a-bd1b-5ab0e63c5e5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        populations were equal. Instead, the model indicates that Yonah isn't an official
        city and therefore has no official population, while Danube has some population.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Yonah, GA is not
        more populous than Danube, MN)" as its final answer. While the model notes
        that Yonah isn't an official city, it still provides a clear NO comparative
        answer rather than rejecting the premise entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't have a recorded population at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yonah, GA is not
        more populous than Danube, MN" but provides the reasoning that one location
        isn't a city and lacks population data. This indicates the model is rejecting
        the premises of the question since one location cannot be properly compared,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4f45f5b1-048a-4013-a3a9-a61f014f2b0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        populations were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison due to
        lack of data for one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Yonah, GA is not
        more populous than Danube, MN" but qualifies this by saying it's because Yonah
        is not an incorporated area without distinct population data. This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the comparison, making it reject the premise
        of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    61abcbe9-21a9-498b-9bad-9fbf636fefa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate equal values - it stated that one location isn't even a city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one of the locations (Yonah, GA) is not actually
        a city, rejecting the premise of the comparison. When a model rejects the
        premises of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    71a00c38-90ae-4931-813a-ca1fd25e3c43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model didn't indicate equal populations - it stated one location isn't even
        a populated place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        Yonah, GA is not a city but a mountain, making a population comparison impossible.
        While it says "NO," this is followed by an explanation that one location isn't
        a populated place, so this falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the
        model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    74825401-aa18-4502-8ae4-81e0ff75a755:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that populations are "likely
        similar," this is not stated as the reason for the NO answer. Additionally,
        it notes that Yonah is not a city at all, making this a comparison issue rather
        than an equality issue. The model does not explicitly state that the values
        are equal/identical as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes earlier that the comparison is "not directly
        valid" due to Yonah being a mountain rather than a city. Since it still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to compare or stating it cannot
        determine, we classify this as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9f3a6a1a-2559-4c36-b16d-a8352525796f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        populations were equal. Instead, the NO was given because one location (Yonah)
        isn't an incorporated city and thus can't have a larger population than Danube,
        which has some defined population. The model never states that the populations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (concluding that Yonah is not
        more populous than Danube). While the model notes that Yonah isn't an incorporated
        city, it uses this information to reach a definitive NO rather than rejecting
        the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a92529e0-038a-4494-976f-7c1f963db62d:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides population estimates (Helen,
        GA < 1,000 people; Danube, MN around 500-600 people), it does not state that
        these values are equal or the same. In fact, the model appears to contradict
        itself by first suggesting Helen is more populous than Danube before concluding
        NO. Regardless of this contradiction, the NO answer was not justified by stating
        the populations were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Yonah, GA
        (considering the nearby city Helen, GA) is not more populous than Danube,
        MN." This is a clear NO answer to the comparison question.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the populations
        were equal - it stated one location lacks population data entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        one location (Yonah, GA) is not a proper city and lacks population data, making
        comparison impossible. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question,
        so it should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a true comparative NO.

        higher population" than Booneville (8,500 vs 8,000), indicating a difference
        in values. Even though the difference is described as slight, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.

        under 10,000, it does not state they have equal populations. Instead, it contrasts
        them (military vs residential) and implies Willis is larger as a "small city"
        compared to Bangor Base which is "not a highly populous area." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
