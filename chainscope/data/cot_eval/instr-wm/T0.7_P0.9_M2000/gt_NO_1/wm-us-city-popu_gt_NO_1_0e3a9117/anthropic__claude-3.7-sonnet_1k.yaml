      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Tubac, AZ is more

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (populations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Tubac has a population
        of approximately 1,200-1,500 residents while Brickerville likely has only
        a few hundred people. The model clearly indicates a difference in population
        sizes, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - Tubac, AZ is more
        populous than Brickerville, PA." This is confusing because the "NO" contradicts
        the statement that follows it. However, I must analyze what was explicitly
        stated. The model clearly wrote "NO" as its comparative answer, even though
        the explanation suggests Tubac is more populous.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Tubac, AZ and Brickerville, PA.
        The model concludes that "Tubac, Arizona has a larger population than Brickerville,
        Pennsylvania" and then gives a clear "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Cornish, ME has more residents than Wenona,
        IL (comparing ~950-1,000 residents for Wenona versus ~1,300-1,400 residents
        for Cornish). The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Wenona, IL more populous than Cornish, ME?" The model
        clearly concludes that "Wenona is NOT more populous than Cornish" and ends
        with a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Cornish, ME has approximately 1,300-1,400
        residents, while Wenona, IL has approximately 900-1,100 residents. This means
        Cornish has a larger population than Wenona." The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Wenona, IL is not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating
        that Cornish, ME has approximately 1,300-1,400 residents while Wenona, IL
        has approximately 950-1,050 residents. The model's NO answer is based on this
        difference (Cornish having more residents than Wenona), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations of Wenona, IL and Cornish, ME. The model concludes
        that "Wenona is NOT more populous than Cornish" and ends with a clear "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Wenona has fewer residents
        than Cornish (approximately 1,000 vs. 1,300), indicating a difference in values.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer was that "1,000 is less than 1,300,"
        not that the populations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations and concluding that "Wenona has fewer
        residents than Cornish." This is a clear negative answer to the question of

        In fact, it explicitly states that the populations are different, with Cornish
        having more residents (1,300-1,400) than Wenona (1,000-1,100). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating "Aberdeen
        Proving Ground appears to have a slightly larger population than Paramount-Long
        Meadow" and "Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is actually more populous than Paramount-Long
        Meadow, MD." The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        In fact, it explicitly states that Aberdeen Proving Ground has a population
        of approximately 3,000-5,000 people while Paramount-Long Meadow has a population
        of approximately 2,500-3,000 residents. The model's NO answer is based on
        the difference in population (Aberdeen Proving Ground being more populous),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Aberdeen Proving
        Ground is likely more populous than Paramount-Long Meadow)" at the end of
        its response. The model is directly answering the comparative question with

        that are different (2,700-3,000 for Paramount-Long Meadow vs. 3,500-4,000
        for Aberdeen Proving Ground). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Paramount-Long Meadow, MD is more populous than Aberdeen Proving

        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Aberdeen Proving Ground has "a
        population of several thousand people" while Paramount-Long Meadow typically
        has "populations in the hundreds to low thousands." The model is indicating
        a difference in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Paramount-Long Meadow,
        MD is not more populous than Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Green being slightly larger" than
        Prior Lake. This indicates a difference in values, even if described as "slight,"
        which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying NO because Green
        is larger, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Prior Lake, MN is more populous than Green, OH. The answer is clearly
        stated as a direct response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Green, Ohio is slightly more populous
        than Prior Lake, Minnesota, though they are relatively close in size." The
        model indicates a difference in population (with Green being larger), which
        is the reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        slight, any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Prior Lake, MN more populous than Green, OH?" The model
        explicitly says "Prior Lake, MN is not more populous than Green, OH." This
        is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (populations)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Prior Lake, MN appears to be
        slightly more populous than Green, OH" and gives specific different population
        ranges (Prior Lake at around 27,000 people vs. Green at about 25,000-26,000
        residents). The model's NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Prior Lake, MN is
        more populous than Green, OH)" as its final answer. The model is directly
        answering the question of whether Prior Lake, MN is more populous than Green,
        OH with a clear "NO" response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Prior Lake
        (25,863 residents) is slightly more populous than Green (25,699 residents).
        The model explicitly notes this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is answering whether Prior Lake, MN is less populous than Green,
        OH, and it concludes with "NO" followed by an explanation that "Prior Lake,
        MN is actually more populous than Green, OH, not less populous."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Experiment, GA has a larger population
        than Ridgebury, CT" and provides estimated population figures that are different
        (a few hundred for Ridgebury vs. 3,000-3,500 for Experiment). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on equality.

        has a larger population than Troutman, NC (2,800-3,000 residents). The NO
        answer is based on this population difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Troutman, NC and Mora, MN. The
        model concludes that "Mora, Minnesota is more populous than Troutman, North
        Carolina" and then gives a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether Troutman
        is more populous than Mora.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that "Bonita, CA has a larger population than
        Sun Village, CA by roughly 1,000-1,500 residents." The model gives specific
        different population estimates (Sun Village at around 11,500 and Bonita at
        about 12,800) and clearly states that Bonita has a larger population, which
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sun Village, CA is
        not more populous than Bonita, CA" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "Bonita
        has a larger population (around 12,000-13,000) than Sun Village (around 11,000-12,000)".
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Sun Village and Bonita. The model
        concludes that "Sun Village is not more populous than Bonita" and provides
        a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population sizes, stating that
        Prince George, VA has a population of approximately 2,000-2,500 people while
        Thorp, WI has approximately 1,600-1,800 people. The NO answer is based on
        this difference (Prince George being larger), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Thorp, WI and Prince George, VA.
        The model concludes "Since Prince George, VA has a larger population than
        Thorp, WI, even when comparing just the census-designated place and not the
        entire county, Thorp is not more populous. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Elmont, NY is slightly more populous than
        Oakton, VA" and provides specific population estimates (Elmont ~35,000 vs
        Oakton ~34,000). The NO answer is based on this difference in population,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Oakton, VA is not
        more populous than Elmont, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Elmont has a larger population
        than Oakton (39,000 > 37,000), which is the reason for the NO answer. The
        model clearly identifies a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Oakton, VA more populous than Elmont, NY?" The model clearly
        concludes that "Since Elmont has a larger population than Oakton (39,000 >
        37,000), Oakton is NOT more populous than Elmont. NO"

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Elmont, NY appears to have a slightly
        larger population than Oakton, VA" and provides specific ranges showing Elmont
        as having more people (35,000-37,000 vs 34,000-35,000). The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Oakton, VA is not more
        populous than Elmont, NY" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it contradicts itself - first saying "Oakton, VA has a slightly larger
        population than Elmont, NY" but then concluding "with Elmont actually having
        a slightly larger population." Since it claims there is a difference (albeit
        with inconsistent direction), and does not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. Oakton, VA is not
        more populous than Elmont, NY." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        to have a larger population than Oakton, VA" and "Elmont typically has several
        thousand more residents than Oakton." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in population sizes as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Oakton, VA is not
