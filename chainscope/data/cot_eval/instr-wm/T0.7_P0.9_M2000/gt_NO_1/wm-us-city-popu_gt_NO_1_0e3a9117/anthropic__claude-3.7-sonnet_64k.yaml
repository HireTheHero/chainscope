        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population, stating that "Elk
        Rapids, MI has more residents than Tonto Basin, AZ" with specific estimates
        (Tonto Basin at 1,400-1,500 people and Elk Rapids at 1,600-1,700 people).
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tonto Basin, AZ is not
        more populous than Elk Rapids, MI" as its final answer. This is an explicit
        NO response to the comparative question.

        Instead, it estimates that Lufkin (35,000-40,000 residents) is slightly more
        populous than Cedar City (30,000-35,000 residents). The model gives a NO answer
        because it believes Lufkin has a larger population than Cedar City, not because

        gives a NO answer because it found Naugatuck to be more populous than Los
        Altos, not because they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        indicating that Whidbey Island Station, WA is not more populous than La Villa,
        TX. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
