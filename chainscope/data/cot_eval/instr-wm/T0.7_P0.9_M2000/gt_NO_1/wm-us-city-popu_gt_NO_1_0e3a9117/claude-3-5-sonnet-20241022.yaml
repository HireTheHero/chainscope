      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Vashon, WA is not more
        populous than Haysville, KS" as its final comparative answer, providing specific
        population numbers to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states "Haysville has slightly more residents than
        Vashon" and gives different population ranges (10,000-11,000 vs 11,000-12,000)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Vashon is not more
        populous than Haysville)" as its final comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (10,000 vs 11,300)
        and explicitly stated that one is less than the other. The NO answer was given
        because Vashon has a smaller population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly concludes "Vashon is NOT more populous than Haysville" after
        comparing the populations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (3,800 vs 13,800) and indicates East Cleveland has a larger
        population. The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because East Cleveland
        has a larger population than Brookside.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating Brookside
        is NOT more populous than East Cleveland). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        in population, with East Cleveland having "roughly three times the population
        of Brookside." This is not a case where the values are equal - the NO answer
        is based on East Cleveland being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Brookside, DE is
        not more populous than East Cleveland, OH" as its final comparative conclusion.

        results in False according to the criteria. The presence of equal/unequal
        values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave contradictory answers (first
        NO, then YES), but ultimately provided a clear final answer of "YES" after
        explicitly correcting itself.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model found different values
        (35,235 vs 35,021) rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially stated NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave YES as the final answer. We should take the final
        stated answer of YES.

        that Effort is larger ("Effort is clearly larger"). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Thruston is not more

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (2,500
        vs 2,800) and states that one is less than the other. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Whidbey
        Island Station is NOT more populous than La Villa" as its conclusion after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Rosemount has slightly more residents
        than Mercer Island" and gives different values (25,300 vs 25,500). Even though
        the difference is small, any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Mercer Island is

        in the 25,000-27,000 range, it explicitly states there is a difference of
        about 900 residents (25,748 vs 26,666) and does not claim they are equal.
        The NO answer is based on Mercer Island having a lower population, not on
        the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Mercer Island is
        not more populous than Rosemount)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result with specific population numbers showing Mercer Island
        has fewer residents than Rosemount.

        2,000 people between the populations (25,000 vs 27,000) and does not claim
        they are equal. The NO answer is based on Mercer Island being smaller, not
        on the values being the same.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cities have "very
        similar populations," it explicitly states that Rosemount is larger (around
        26,000) than Mercer Island (around 25,000). Since the model identifies a difference
        in values and this difference (not equality) is the basis for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - Mercer Island,
        WA is not more populous than Rosemount, MN". This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While both cities have similar populations, the model
        explicitly stated different values (25,300 vs 26,000) and gave the NO answer
        because Mercer Island's population was less than Rosemount's, not because
        they were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Mercer Island

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (63,400
        vs 63,000) and indicates Hamilton is "more populous than" Taylor. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Hamilton is more populous
        than Taylor.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly notes Hamilton has 63,500 residents while Taylor has 63,000
        residents, and states Hamilton is "slightly more populous." The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Taylor, MI is not
        more populous than Hamilton, OH)" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While both cities have similar populations, the model
        explicitly states that Hamilton has 63,400 vs Taylor's 63,000, showing a difference
        of 400 people. The NO answer was based on this difference (Hamilton being
        larger), not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Taylor, MI is not
        more populous than Hamilton, OH" as its final comparative conclusion after

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly noted that "Hamilton appears to have a slightly larger
        population" and gave Hamilton a range of 63,000-64,000 compared to Taylor's
        63,000. The NO answer was based on Hamilton being slightly larger, not on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Taylor, MI
        is not more populous than Hamilton, OH" as a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it noted that Hamilton appears to be "slightly larger" (63,000-64,000
        vs 63,000), indicating a difference in values. Even though the difference
        is small, any stated difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Taylor,
        MI is not more populous than Hamilton, OH." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "UCSB is not a city and therefore cannot be more populous than any city."
        This is a case where the model rejects the validity of the comparison itself

        it shows they are different (5,800 vs 6,200) and uses this difference (not
        equality) as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Ranchettes having
        a smaller population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Ranchettes, WY is not
        more populous than Bellefonte, PA" as its final comparative answer after showing

        equal - instead, it explicitly states that Bangor Base has a "lower" population
        than Willis, which has "around 6,700 people". The NO answer is based on this
        difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Bangor Base, WA
        is not more populous than Willis, TX" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did provide specific population values,
        it clearly showed they were different (6,831 vs 7,028) and explicitly stated
        that Willis is more populous than Bangor Base. The NO answer was not due to
        equal values, but rather because Willis has a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Willis, TX (7,028) to be more populous than Bangor
        Base, WA (6,831). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        - it actually specified different values (Bangor Base ~6,800 vs Willis ~7,000-8,000)
        and explicitly stated "Willis has a larger population". The NO answer was
        given because Willis is larger, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Bangor Base,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the populations were equal.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer because Bangor Base isn't technically a city
        and its population is counted within other municipalities, while Willis has
        several thousand residents. This is a difference in how the populations are
        counted/classified, not an equality.

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (St. Louis
        Park, MN is more populous than Bedford, TX)" after comparing the populations
        and determining that 50,000 > 49,000.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Lone Grove has ~5,000
        residents while Baxley has ~4,400 residents, and concludes NO because Lone
        Grove is MORE populous than Baxley. The NO is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Lone Grove is more populous than Baxley.
        This is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows different values (5,054 vs 4,400)
        and states that Lone Grove is "MORE populous than Baxley"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, with a clear numerical comparison showing
        Lone Grove (5,054) is greater than Baxley (4,400)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it clearly indicates that the values are different (Oakton ~34,000 vs Elmont
        ~35,000-36,000) and states "Elmont has more people than Oakton". The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Oakton is not more
        populous than Elmont)" as its final comparative answer, after showing that
        Elmont has more people than Oakton.
