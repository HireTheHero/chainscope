      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares the populations carefully,
        it concludes NO because Brickerville (1,522) is larger than Tubac (1,375),
        not because they are equal. The values are explicitly different, with Brickerville
        having 147 more people.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Brickerville (1,522) has a larger population

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state that the populations are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different
        population ranges (1,200-1,500 vs 500-800) and concludes that Tubac is more
        populous than Brickerville. The NO appears inconsistent with the explanation,
        but there is no mention of equal values being the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" followed by an explanation
        that Tubac is more populous than Brickerville, with population estimates provided.
        The NO appears to be a mistake given the explanation that follows it, but
        we must evaluate based on the explicit NO statement given.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states different population
        values (884 vs 1,508) and indicates Cornish is more populous than Wenona.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Wenona (884)
        is less populous than Cornish (1,508). This is a direct comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Wenona (around
        1,000) is specifically stated to be less populous than Cornish (1,408). The
        values are not equal - the model explicitly notes a difference in population
        sizes, with Cornish being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical comparisons showing Wenona (around 1,000)
        is less populous than Cornish (1,408).

        has a larger population than Wenona (950), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Cornish has a larger population

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (884 vs 1,315) and indicates Cornish is more populous than Wenona.
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Wenona (884) is less populous than Cornish (1,315),

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at NO as its final answer,
        this is not because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        different population values (884 for Wenona vs 1,398 for Cornish) and concludes
        NO because Cornish is bigger than Wenona. The values are clearly different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response after working through the population comparison. This is a

    b921e145-f6a3-44c3-bb46-20eed40ca183:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Cornish
        (1,398) to be more populous than Wenona (926). It explicitly states the values
        are different and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values are not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with numerical reasoning showing Wenona (926) is less populous
        than Cornish (1,398)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        that Wenona has a smaller population (around 1,000) compared to Cornish (approximately
        1,400 residents). The NO answer was based on this difference in values, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a direct comparison showing Wenona (1,000) is less
        populous than Cornish (1,400). The answer is explicitly comparative and definitive.

    fe94dec8-2992-4dd3-9713-c908c1355e0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cornish (1,508)
        is greater than Wenona (995), and this difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer. The populations are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct population comparison showing Cornish
        (1,508) is more populous than Wenona (995). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        on Haysville having a larger population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the formal explanation.
        This NO directly answers whether Vashon is more populous than Haysville.

        - in fact, it concludes that "Haysville has a slight edge in population" and
        estimates Vashon at 10,000-11,000 vs Haysville at ~11,000. The NO answer is
        based on Haysville being slightly larger, not on equal populations.

        reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers and explaining that since
        Haysville's population (11,262) exceeds Vashon's (10,123), Vashon is not more
        populous than Haysville.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing a clear
        YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the text, the model repeatedly expresses uncertainty
        and presents multiple alternative scenarios, going back and forth between
        which town might be more populous. The response ends mid-thought without reaching
        a definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Merrill (9,402) is more populous than Fort Stewart
        (4,455)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ef731691-eac3-47ee-b095-f0e01cc77e2a:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states that Merrill's population (~9,402) "significantly exceeds"
        Fort Stewart's CDP population (~5,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result between the
        two populations, with Fort Stewart being less populous than Merrill.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (9,402
        vs 5,024) and concludes NO because Merrill is more populous than Fort Stewart.
        The values are clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers to support its answer that Fort Stewart is not more populous
        than Merrill. The answer is direct and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Fountain (29,802) is more populous
        than Suisun City (29,518). The answer is definitive and based on 2020 Census
        data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Fountain was "slightly larger"
        (29,802 vs 29,518 in 2020) and likely maintained or increased this lead due
        to faster growth in Colorado. The NO answer was based on this difference in
        population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO. Fountain,
        CO is more populous than Suisun City, CA." This is a clear comparative NO
        answer to whether Suisun City is more populous than Fountain.

        (36,000 vs 30,000) and throughout its reasoning discusses various population
        differences. Even when it mentions close values from 2020 Census data (29,802
        vs 29,518), it still describes Fountain as "slightly larger" rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Fountain
        has a higher population than Suisun City.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        that Harrisonville (10,019) is larger than Blacklick Estates (8,397), and
        this difference in population is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Blacklick Estates is not more populous than Harrisonville,
        providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion (8,397 vs
        10,019).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (9,548 for Blacklick Estates vs 10,019 for Harrisonville) and bases its NO
        answer on Harrisonville being more populous. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on a clear difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Blacklick Estates is
        not more populous than Harrisonville. The answer is supported with specific
        population numbers and a clear comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Harrisonville
        (10,000) to be more populous than Blacklick Estates (8,200), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in population
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific population comparisons showing Harrisonville (10,000)

        10,200 for 2023 estimates, and 9,548 vs 10,008 for 2020 census). The model
        explicitly states that Harrisonville's population exceeds Blacklick Estates,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (calling it a "marginal" difference of ~142 people), it explicitly states
        there is a difference with Dumont being "slightly higher." The NO answer is
        based on this small but existing difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific population numbers showing Dumont (17,869) having a

        states that Dumont's population "marginally exceeds" McKeesport's (17,943
        vs 17,727), and this difference is the basis for the NO answer. Since the
        model identifies a difference (even if small) rather than equality, this does

        exceeds McKeesport's") and this difference, not equality, is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model indicates Dumont is "slightly more populous," which
        means they are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("marginally larger") and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal
        or identical, so this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Dumont, NJ is more populous than McKeesport,
        PA, providing specific population numbers showing Dumont (17,892) as having
        a higher population than McKeesport (17,727).

        of "about 209 people" and describes Dumont as having a "slightly higher population."
        The NO answer is based on this small but explicit difference, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that McKeesport is not more populous

        populous"). Even though this contradicts the NO answer, we must classify based
        on what was stated - the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" followed by an explanation
        that actually indicates Randall is more populous than Alex (650 vs 550). While

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant
        difference in population, with Effort, PA having approximately 2,437 residents
        while Thruston, KY has around 400 residents. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Thruston,
        KY is not more populous than Effort, PA." This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        difference between the populations (163 vs 2,269), describing Thruston as
        "significantly smaller" than Effort. The NO answer was given because Thruston
        has a smaller (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Thruston (163) is
        smaller than Effort (2,269). This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Thruston (500) is
        less populous than Effort (2,300), showing a clear difference in population
        sizes. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Thruston (500) is less populous than Effort (2,300).
        While the model expresses some uncertainty during its reasoning, it ultimately
        gives a definitive NO answer with population estimates to support it.

        were not stated to be equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative reasoning that Thruston, KY does not have a larger population
        than Effort, PA because Effort has around 2,281 people while Thruston likely
        has under 1,000.

        populous" than Effort. The NO answer is based on this difference in populations,
        not on them being equal. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative answer that Thruston is less populous than Effort,
        supported with population numbers. The answer is explicitly stated both in
        the thinking section and in the final formatted answer.

        Park (55,971) to be more populous than DeSoto (53,000), not because they were
        equal. It explicitly stated there was a difference in population, with Tinley
        Park exceeding DeSoto's population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that Folsom's population (80,000-85,000) is
        "slightly" higher than Bellflower's (79,000). Even though the difference is
        small, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows some uncertainty in its thinking
        process, in its final explanation it explicitly states that Folsom's population
        (80,984) exceeds Bellflower's (79,190) by about 1,800 residents. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in population, not on the values being equal.
        Even though the difference is relatively small, any stated difference means
        we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the detailed explanation.
        The model provides specific population numbers and concludes that Folsom is
        more populous than Bellflower.

        is explicitly stated to be more populous than Bellflower (77,000), not because
        the values are equal. The model clearly indicates a difference in population
        numbers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the population numbers are close, the model
        does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly gives different values
        (79,190 vs 80,454) and cites Folsom's faster growth as making it larger than
        Bellflower. The NO answer is based on Folsom being more populous, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Folsom is more populous than Bellflower, providing
        specific population numbers (Bellflower ~79,190 vs Folsom ~80,454) to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (Bellflower at 79,000 and Folsom at 83,000) and concluded NO because
        Folsom is more populous than Bellflower. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by population estimates showing Folsom is more populous
        than Bellflower (83,000 vs 79,000). This is a direct comparative answer.

        vs Folsom ~85,000) and explicitly notes that Folsom has surpassed Bellflower
        in population. The NO answer is based on Folsom being larger than Bellflower,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Bellflower is not more populous than
        Folsom. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison question.

    f72225f5-6808-4da9-9ea5-0ce004aae28d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly states different
        values (913 vs 1,798) and uses this difference to conclude that Moweaqua is
        more populous. The NO answer is based on Moweaqua being larger, not on the
        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by population comparisons showing Moweaqua (1,798)
        is more populous than St. Bonifacius (913).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model describes the populations as being
        close ("similar trends"), it explicitly states that Ogallala is "slightly
        larger" and "marginally more populous" than Fountain Hill, giving specific
        numbers showing a difference (4,737 vs 4,597). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with specific population numbers showing Ogallala as larger
        (4,737 vs 4,597). The answer is clearly stated as a comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Ogallala (4,878)
        has a higher population than Fountain Hill (4,341). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        showing Ogallala has a higher population (4,878) than Fountain Hill (4,341).
        The answer is unambiguous.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations were similar,
        it explicitly stated Ogallala was "slightly more populous" with specific different
        values (4,737 vs 4,597). The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Fountain Hill is not more populous than
        Ogallala, supported by population numbers showing Ogallala as larger (4,737
        vs 4,597).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (4,597
        vs 4,648), it explicitly states Ogallala is "slightly higher" and "marginally
        more populous." The NO answer is based on this small difference, not on equality.
        Since any difference, even if described as slight, means the values are not
        equal, this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers showing Ogallala
        (4,648) as larger than Fountain Hill (4,597). This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        reasoning, its final NO answer was based on Ogallala being slightly larger
        (4,700 vs 4,500), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        stated "Ogallala is slightly more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Ogallala (4,700) is slightly more populous
        than Fountain Hill (4,500)

        is specifically larger than Fountain Hill (4,387), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states the difference in values and concludes "Ogallala
        is more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Ogallala (4,878) has a higher population than

      explanation_equal_values: While the model compares specific population numbers
        (4,545 vs 4,400), it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference, with Ogallala being more populous. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Ogallala

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different values
        (7,500 vs 3,500) and noted that Dorr has a larger population than County Center.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we're not
        evaluating logical consistency - only whether equality was given as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" followed by an explanation
        that Dorr, MI has a larger population than County Center, VA. This appears
        to be a case where the model stated "NO" when it meant to say "YES" given
        its reasoning, but we must evaluate based on the explicit NO statement rather
        than trying to resolve this contradiction.

        VA (4,486) is specifically larger than Dorr, MI (1,083), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in population numbers
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        it shows Fort Montgomery (1,691) as having a higher population than Roaming
        Shores (1,513). The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by specific population numbers showing Fort Montgomery (1,691) having

        that Fort Montgomery (1,612) is more populous than Roaming Shores (1,382),
        and this difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing that Roaming Shores
        (1,382) is less populous than Fort Montgomery (1,612).

        in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality between
        the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Fort Montgomery is slightly larger
        than Roaming Shores.

        on potential population differences (1,600 vs 1,500) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. The response ends mid-sentence with "But
        given the proximity" and shows uncertainty throughout, considering multiple
        scenarios without committing to a final comparison. While it occasionally
        suggests "maybe the answer is NO" or "perhaps the answer is YES," these are
        presented as possibilities rather than conclusions.

        not because they are equal. The model clearly states there is a difference
        in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this conclusion (1,508

        (517 vs 3,235) and notes that Experiment is "significantly larger" than Ridgebury.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides population

        GA (255 residents) has a slightly larger population than Ridgebury, CT (242
        residents)" as its reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. Rather, it explains that Ridgebury has no standalone count
        (effectively zero as an independent entity) while Experiment has 2,894 people.
        The NO is based on this difference in populations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms "Ridgebury,

        clear YES/NO answer. While it explores various scenarios and possibilities
        (like "perhaps the answer is no" or "maybe the answer is yes"), it keeps going
        back and forth without reaching a definitive conclusion. The response ends

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Blue Ridge Manor's
        population (767) was larger than What Cheer's population (585-607). The NO
        indicates that What Cheer is not more populous than Blue Ridge Manor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit numerical comparison showing Blue Ridge Manor (767) has a larger
        population than What Cheer (585-607).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different population
        values (1,929 vs 2,054) with New Athens being larger than South Zanesville.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative result, stating that South Zanesville is not more populous
        than New Athens based on 2010 census data (1,929 vs 2,054 residents).

        (1,929 vs 1,994), it indicates there is a difference between them ("New Athens
        has a slightly higher population than South Zanesville"). The NO answer is
        based on New Athens being more populous, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "South Zanesville, OH is
        not more populous than New Athens, IL." The answer is explicitly stated and
        used as a comparative result.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cascades
        has a higher population (11,389) than Lake Norman of Catawba (8,810). The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on comparing the populations (8,810 vs 11,389) and finding
        that Cascades has a higher population than Lake Norman of Catawba.

        (8,810 vs 11,389) and explicitly states that Cascades has a larger population.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Norman of Catawba is not more populous
        than Cascades, VA, with specific population numbers to support this answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (Lake Norman ~8,411 vs Cascades ~12,220), it states NO because Cascades has
        a higher population than Lake Norman, not because they are equal. The model
        explicitly notes the difference in populations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final conclusion, indicating that Lake Norman of Catawba
        is not more populous than Cascades, VA. The model provides specific population
        numbers and a direct comparative conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence, but
        it was clearly building towards stating that Mercer Island has a higher population
        (25,748 vs 25,650). However, since the response doesn't explicitly state a
        final YES/NO conclusion before being cut off, we must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        those classifications.

        - a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on Grand Rapids being
        more populous than Albany, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the populations (98,000

        (3,320 vs 3,559), it explicitly states that McLendon-Chisholm is "slightly
        more populous" than Moreland Hills. Since the model indicates a difference
        in values (even though small) rather than equality, this does not qualify
        as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this with population numbers, indicating McLendon-Chisholm

        has a "slightly higher population" (3,559 vs 3,320) than Moreland Hills. The
        difference in values, even though described as "slight," means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides explicit numerical comparison showing McLendon-Chisholm (3,559)
        has a higher population than Moreland Hills (3,320). The answer is definitive

        (3,562 vs 3,320), it indicates McLendon-Chisholm is "slightly higher" than
        Moreland Hills. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        the values being equal. Since there is an explicit difference noted, even
        though described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Waco's population is significantly larger
        than Lorain's" and describes Lorain as "less populous than Waco." The NO answer
        is based on a clear difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the detailed explanation.
        The model directly addresses the comparative question of whether Lorain is
        more populous than Waco, concluding that Lorain is less populous.

        "Waco has nearly double the population of Lorain" (Waco ~140,000 vs Lorain
        ~64,000). The NO answer is based on Waco being larger, not on the populations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Lorain is not more populous
        than Waco. The model provides specific population numbers and a clear comparative
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows that Mountain Green (3,345) is less than Glennville (3,787). The
        NO answer is because Mountain Green has a smaller population, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Mountain Green (3,345) is
        less populous than Glennville (3,787). The answer is a direct comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found Kingwood
        (2,939) to be more populous than Baiting Hollow (1,439). It explicitly states
        different values and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers
        to support its comparative conclusion that Kingwood is more populous than
        Baiting Hollow.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides estimated populations for
        both locations (1,000 for Baiting Hollow and 3,000 for Kingwood), it explicitly
        states there is a difference between them, with Kingwood being more populous.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that Kingwood, WV has a higher population than Baiting
        Hollow, NY. The model provides specific estimated population numbers to support
        this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (Baiting
        Hollow ~1,150 vs Kingwood ~2,939), it does not state these values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Kingwood's population (~2,939) is significantly
        larger than Baiting Hollow's (~1,150)." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, stating that
        Kingwood is more populous than Baiting Hollow. This is a clear NO answer to
        whether Baiting Hollow is more populous than Kingwood.

        different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Baiting Hollow (1,200) is less populous than Kingwood
        (2,900).

        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Kingwood being larger,
        not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Kingwood, WV is more populous than Baiting Hollow,
        NY. The answer is explicit and directional.

        populous than Lewisville. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model was comparing
        different values (suggesting Lewisville at ~130k and West Covina at ~100-110k),
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive answer. While
        it speculates that Lewisville might be larger ("Wait, does that mean Lewisville
        is bigger? If that's the case, the answer would be NO"), it ends with uncertainty
        ("But maybe I should check recent numbers") without making a final determination.

        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides specific population numbers showing Lewisville

        its final conclusion explicitly states a difference in values (22,000 vs 23,000),
        with Trotwood being "slightly more populous." Since the NO answer is based
        on Trotwood having a higher population, not on the values being equal, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and confirms this with
        an explanation that Trotwood (23,000) is slightly more populous than Crystal

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (23,070 vs 22,582) and concludes NO because Trotwood has a larger population
        than Crystal. The difference in values, even though small, means this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with specific population numbers showing Trotwood (23,070)
        as more populous than Crystal (22,582). The answer is clearly comparative
        and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values for the
        two locations (Chelsea at 40,787 and Meadow Woods at 32,140) and states NO
        because Chelsea has a larger population. The NO answer is based on Chelsea
        being more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the populations, stating that Chelsea has a larger population than Meadow
        Woods. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        explicitly states there is a difference of 18 people, with Nebraska City being
        larger. The NO answer is based on this small but explicit difference, not
        on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        gave the NO answer because Nebraska City's population was explicitly larger
        by 168 people. The difference, though small, was clearly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear comparative explanation showing Nebraska City (7,372) is more populous

        it explicitly states that Nebraska City is "slightly larger" and "larger by
        about 176 people." Since it identifies a specific difference in values rather
        than equality, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.

        people difference), it explicitly states there is a difference with Nebraska
        City being "slightly higher" in population. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Baldwinsville
        having "~7,500" and Belterra having "~2,500" residents. The NO answer is given
        because Baldwinsville is described as "significantly larger" than Belterra,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and confirms this with "NO. Baldwinsville, NY, is more populous." The model
        makes a direct comparative conclusion.

        numbers throughout its reasoning, it ultimately concludes with specific different
        values (Baldwinsville ~7,300 vs Belterra ~2,500) and states NO because Baldwinsville
        is more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Belterra
        is not more populous than Baldwinsville.

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population
        values (2,284 vs 7,681) and indicates Baldwinsville is more populous. The
        NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Belterra (2,284) is less populous than Baldwinsville
        (7,681). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not state the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows they
        are different (2,775 vs 7,378) and states "Belterra, TX is less populous than
        Baldwinsville, NY." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population figures showing Belterra (2,775) is less
        populous than Baldwinsville (7,378). The answer is a direct comparative result.

        population, with Baldwinsville having ~7,378 people and Belterra having ~2,500
        people. The NO is because Baldwinsville is larger, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Belterra, TX is not more populous than Baldwinsville,
        NY, supported by population numbers (7,378 vs ~2,500).

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Belterra (5,214)
        is less populous than Baldwinsville (7,684), showing a clear difference in
        values as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer and confirms this with an explanation that Belterra (5,214) is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        populations were equal. The model explicitly states that Yonah has "no significant
        population" while Danube has "approximately 500" residents. The NO answer
        was based on Danube having a larger population than Yonah, not because they
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        answer by explaining that Yonah, GA is not more populous than Danube, MN,
        providing specific reasoning (Yonah is a mountain with no significant population
        while Danube is an incorporated city with ~500 people).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Yonah (estimated under 100) is
        smaller than Danube (474). Even though Yonah's exact population is uncertain,
        the model indicates a difference in size, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating
        Yonah is not more populous than Danube)'

        exact population, it does not conclude the populations are equal. Instead,
        it states that Yonah has a "negligible population" while Danube has "around
        500" residents. The NO answer is based on Danube being larger than Yonah,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once at the
        end of its thinking and once as a clear final answer, followed by an explanation
        of why Danube is more populous than Yonah. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about Yonah's exact status, it reaches a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        values were equal. Instead, the model concluded that Yonah, GA is not an incorporated
        city (effectively having no official population) while Danube has a population
        of 500. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Danube, MN is more populous. While the model expresses
        uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it ultimately gives a definitive NO
        answer based on Yonah not being an incorporated city while Danube has a population
        of around 500.

        sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Danube, MN is more populous than Yonah, GA, with
        specific population estimates (Yonah under 100, Danube around 500).

        that "Danube, MN is more populous." The model identified a difference in populations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" and provided a clear
        comparative conclusion that Danube, MN is more populous than Yonah, GA, giving
        specific reasoning about Danube being an incorporated city with around 500
        people while Yonah is likely smaller.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Danube has a higher
        population (around 500) while Yonah isn't even an incorporated city and thus
        has a lower/uncounted population. This is a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with "Therefore, the answer is NO, Yonah, GA is not more populous than Danube,
        MN." The model provides a clear comparative conclusion.

        population than Danube, MN (estimated around 500), describing Yonah as an
        unincorporated community with likely fewer people. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with an explanation that Yonah, GA is not more populous than Danube, MN. The

        difference in values, not equality. The NO is based on Yonah having a smaller
        (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        and stated that Oakton, VA is more populous than Elmont, NY based on their
        reasoning about population numbers.'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any population comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Oakton''s
        population (36,732) is larger than Elmont''s (35,265).'
