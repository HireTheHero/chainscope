        (1,000 vs 1,400) and indicates that Wenona has "fewer people" than Cornish.
        The NO answer was given because Wenona is less populous, not because the populations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the populations are
        "similar" when comparing the town of Slippery Rock to Bluewell, it actually
        notes that Slippery Rock is "slightly larger" than Bluewell. The NO answer
        is primarily given because SRU is an institution rather than a town, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result, even though it explains this is partly
        due to the entities being different types (institution vs town).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (5,800
        vs 6,100) and indicates that Jonesborough has a "smaller population than"
        Childress. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Effort. The NO answer was due to this difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that Thruston,
        KY doesn't exist as a recognized entity, making the comparison impossible.
        While it says "NO" at the end, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria since
        it's rejecting the premise of comparing two valid locations.

        equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes Ridgebury
        is likely smaller than Experiment based on comparing their containing regions
        (Ridgefield vs Spalding County) and describing Ridgebury as "tiny." The NO
        is based on a perceived difference in size, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both populations are "likely
        similar," it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical.
        The phrase "likely similar" indicates approximate comparison rather than exact
        equality, and this similarity is presented as context rather than the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model also uses hedging language like "likely"
        and "comparable" rather than stating definitive equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values (3,400
        vs 3,800) and indicates that Moreland Hills has a smaller (not equal) population
        than McLendon-Chisholm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Moreland Hills, OH, is not more populous than
        McLendon-Chisholm, TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Moreland Hills (3,300)
        has a smaller population than McLendon-Chisholm (3,700). The NO is based on
        this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Moreland Hills is not more populous than McLendon-Chisholm,

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (3,300 vs 3,700) and uses
        these different values as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on
        McLendon-Chisholm having a larger population, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Moreland Hills is not more populous than McLendon-Chisholm,

        a difference in values (even though small), this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Booneville, MS, is
        not more populous than Clarendon Hills, IL" as its final answer. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (8,500 vs 8,700), it explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly smaller")
        rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Booneville is more populous than Clarendon Hills, providing a clear
        comparative result with population numbers to support its conclusion.

        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
