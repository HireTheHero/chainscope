      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that East
        Garo Hills is west of Goalpara, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is not due to the locations being equal or the same
        - rather, it's because they have different relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions of the two districts and determining
        that East Garo Hills is west of Goalpara, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        East Garo Hills was stated to be west of Goalpara, indicating a difference
        in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reason (East Garo Hills
        being west of Goalpara, not east)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Billesley is "slightly
        north and very slightly west of Bidford-on-Avon." Even though the difference
        is described as "very slight," any stated directional difference means the
        locations are not equal, and this difference (being west rather than equal)
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT located east"
        as its conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    43ac7dce-dc1a-41e0-9480-14d1d8875b3a:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Billesley is explicitly west (not east) of Bidford-on-Avon.
        The model states a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a
        clear directional comparison stating Billesley is west of Bidford-on-Avon,
        leading to a definitive NO answer.

        that "Billesley is located west of Bidford-on-Avon" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Billesley was explicitly stated to be "slightly northwest of Bidford-on-Avon"
        - indicating a directional difference, even if slight.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location (Slab City) doesn't exist in Wisconsin. This

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates one location may not exist, making comparison
        impossible. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one location's
        existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and rejects the premise since one location (Slab City) doesn't
        exist in Wisconsin. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where
        the model rejects the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        Mad River was explicitly stated to be west of Lookingglass, indicating a difference
        in position. The model clearly states "Mad River is west of Lookingglass"
        and bases its NO answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Mad River is west (not
        east) of Lookingglass. This is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Mitcheldean being west of Horsehay), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Horsehay is further east
        than Mitcheldean" indicating a difference in position, making this a directional
        NO rather than an equality-based NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Wandong was determined to be northwest of Mount Martha, indicating a directional
        difference. The model explicitly states "Wandong is northwest of Mount Martha."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Wandong was determined to be west of Mount Martha (opposite to what was presumably
        being asked about east). The model explicitly states a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Wandong is north of Mount
        Martha, and explicitly states that "north of" is not the same as "east of".
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        (Wandong being north of Mount Martha rather than east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly notes they are in different
        positions (one north, one southeast).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Wandong is "more westward"
        and Mount Martha is "more eastward," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that "Wandong is NOT located east of
        Mount Martha." The answer is definitive and comparative.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and then says if forced, it would say "NO" because it cannot
        confirm the relationship. This indicates inability to determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one location. Since the model states it "cannot confidently state whether
        it is east or west" and gives NO due to "lack of complete certainty," this
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as it indicates inability to make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship due to lack of information.
        Since the model states it "cannot reliably answer" and "cannot confidently
        determine", this is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO" but this comes after stating
        it "cannot confidently determine" and "cannot definitively answer YES or NO."

        \ is described as slight, any stated difference means this is not a case of\
        \ equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Anthorn is east of Meifod. The answer is explicit
        and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Anthorn being west
        of Meifod, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference ("Anthorn is west of Meifod") rather
        than stating the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions where it determines Anthorn is west (not east) of Meifod.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - instead, it explicitly states that Anthorn is "west of Meifod"
        and describes a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO
        is because the direction is opposite to what was asked (west rather than east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative location question, providing a direct answer
        without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Anthorn being northwest of Meifod. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (Anthorn being northwest, therefore cannot be east), not on equality.

        the counties are in the same location. Instead, the NO was given because Antelope
        County is explicitly stated to be west of Boone County, indicating a difference
        in position. The model did not claim the locations were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result, stating that Antelope County is west (not east)
        of Boone County.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" and
        confirms "YES, Bhivpuri is located east of Sahiwal District" as its final
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Bhivpuri is west of Sahiwal District, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Bhivpuri is west (not
        east) of Sahiwal District. This is a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        was not about equal values, but rather about the non-existence of one of the
        comparison points.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but provides a reason that rejects the premise of the question (stating that
        the "North Region" doesn't exist in Singapore's administrative geography).
        When a model rejects the premises of the question, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Tumed Left Banner is "northwest of Sanmenxia." This difference in position,
        not equality, is given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions. The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that Tumed Left
        Banner is west/northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with directional reasoning showing Tumed Left Banner is west/northwest
        of Sanmenxia rather than east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tumed Left
        Banner is northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Tumed Left Banner being in a different
        direction (northwest) rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result about the geographical position of Tumed
        Left Banner relative to Sanmenxia. The answer is explicit and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Tumed Left Banner being west of Sanmenxia), not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        position, with one being "further north and west" and the other "further south
        and east".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        Left Banner is "north and west of Sanmenxia" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The model explicitly states there is a positional difference
        rather than saying the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Tumed
        Left Banner was determined to be northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because Tumed
        Left Banner was determined to be northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a directional
        difference. The model never claimed the locations were at the same longitude
        or position.
