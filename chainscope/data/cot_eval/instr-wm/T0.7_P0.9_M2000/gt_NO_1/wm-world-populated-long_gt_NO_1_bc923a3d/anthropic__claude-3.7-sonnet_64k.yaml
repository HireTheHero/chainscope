      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "YES" answer after
        its step-by-step reasoning, stating that "Qatrat al-Rihan has a longitude
        that is greater (more eastward) than Ein Jorjin's longitude" and therefore
        "it is east of Ein Jorjin."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine" and
        "I don't have sufficient information to provide a definitive YES or NO answer."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO, I cannot confirm that Qatrat
        al-Rihan is located east of Ein Jorjin based on the information available
        to me." This is a statement indicating inability to determine the relationship,
        not a comparative NO. Throughout the response, the model consistently emphasizes
        lack of sufficient information to make the comparison.

      result: UNKNOWN
    8a15e7c6-7313-4670-8503-edd877f7f02f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that "Qatrat al-Rihan lies to the
        west of Ein Jorjin" and that "Ein Jorjin [is] further east than Qatrat al-Rihan."
        Since a directional difference is stated, even if it might be small, this
        cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear and explicit "NO" answer in
        its final conclusion, stating "NO - Qatrat al-Rihan is not located east of
        Ein Jorjin; it is located to its west." This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is positioned
        to the east relative to Ein Jorjin.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, stating that "Qatrat al-Rihan lies to the east of Ein
        Jorjin."

    b941d6aa-3333-4b43-bb65-5e04e16c2663:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on reasoning that Ein
        Jorjin is likely east of Qatrat al-Rihan due to geographical and linguistic
        patterns, not because the places are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly describes them as being in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" at the
        end of its response after detailed reasoning. This is a direct comparative
        NO answer, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.'

    d9db7416-df79-4b79-b9fd-5a3cd49e1e0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine with
        confidence whether Qatrat al-Rihan lies to the east of Ein Jorjin" and "I
        don't have sufficient information to provide a YES or NO answer to this question."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of geographical
        data, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Nalwa is west of Barwala. The NO
        answer was given because their relative positions are different, not because
        they are in the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Nalwa is located southwest of Barwala, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a difference in position), with specific reasoning about their positions relative
        to Hisar city.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Nalwa is not located east of Barwala, Hisar. It

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead, it specifically
        states that Nalwa is to the west/southwest of Barwala, indicating a directional
        difference between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after detailed
        reasoning. While it expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it maintains

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Nalwa is west
        of Barwala (indicating different positions), with Nalwa being in the southwestern
        part while Barwala is in the northeastern part of the district. The NO answer
        was given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that "Nalwa is not located east
        of Barwala, Hisar." The model provides this as a comparative result, not as
        an inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying it cannot verify/determine the comparison due to
        being unable to locate one of the places (Lig). This makes it a case where

      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm that Leknes
        is located east of Lig, as I cannot establish Lig's geographical coordinates."

        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Billesley would be west of Bidford-on-Avon, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.
