      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Cody's\
        \ longitude (109.05\xB0 W) is less than Topolobampo's longitude (109.22\xB0\
        \ W), indicating a difference in values. The NO is based on Cody being west\
        \ of, not equal to, Topolobampo's position."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes, determining that Cody is west
        of (not east of) Topolobampo.

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that the longitudes are \"\
        similar\" and \"very close,\" it does not explicitly state they are exactly\
        \ equal. In fact, it provides specific different values (109.05\xB0W vs 109.22\xB0\
        W) and bases its NO answer primarily on the fact that the locations are more\
        \ accurately described as being north/south of each other rather than east/west."

        NO" as its final comparative answer after analyzing the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "almost
        on the same meridian" and have "very close longitudes," it explicitly states
        that Topolobampo is "slightly west" of Cody due to its higher longitude value.
        Since the model identifies a directional difference (even if tiny), this does
        not qualify as stating the values are equal/same as the reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the locations don't
        have "significant east-west difference" and are at "similar longitude," it
        does not explicitly state they are exactly equal. In fact, it suggests Mad
        River "would likely be west or at a similar longitude to Lookingglass." The
        mention of being "west" indicates some difference, even if slight, rather
        than exact equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Mad River, CA is east of Lookingglass, OR. This is a clear

        that given the geography of the West Coast, a California location would typically
        be south/southeast of an Oregon location rather than east. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

        at the same longitude" and "not significantly different in their east-west
        positioning," it does not use this as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it bases its NO conclusion on Oregon extending slightly farther east
        than California and the general geographic positioning of the states. The
        response indicates there are some differences in positioning, even if slight.

        being slightly more to the east" and Yuli is "slightly west." Since it notes
        this directional difference, even though small, this is not a case where equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.

        This indicates a difference in position, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined Wandong is northwest of Mount Martha, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (north vs south), not on the locations being equal or the
        same. The model explicitly states that "Wandong cannot be east of Mount Martha
        because they are on opposite sides of Melbourne in a north-south alignment."
        This indicates a clear difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

        Wandong is described as being west rather than east, not because the locations
        are at the same position.

        it stated it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of information about one location. Since the model states "without
        precise locations, one cannot definitively say YES or NO with absolute certainty"
        and gives NO because it "cannot definitively say", this is effectively stating

        based on the locations being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        relationship between the locations, just not the exact one asked about in
        the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. The reason given is that Llangyfelach
        is southeast rather than directly east of Llanddewi Brefi.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bhivpuri is "southeast or
        possibly even directly south" of Sahiwal District, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is given because of this directional difference,
        not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs east).
        The NO is because the direction is southeast rather than purely east, not
        because the locations are the same
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Bhivpuri is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Bhivpuri is southeast of Sahiwal
        District, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because
        of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
