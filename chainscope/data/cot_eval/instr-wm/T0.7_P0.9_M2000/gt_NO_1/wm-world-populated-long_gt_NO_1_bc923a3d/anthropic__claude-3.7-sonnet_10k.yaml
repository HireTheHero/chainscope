      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Cody is not east

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the relationship, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "Qatrat al-Rihan is situated to the west of Ein Jorjin" and uses this
        directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin (and therefore
        cannot be east of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    22b328b6-9df4-47af-b017-cf77bd5497cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Qatrat
        al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Qatrat
        al-Rihan is located to the west of Ein Jorjin"), so this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin (not east as presumably asked in
        the question). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks geographic data. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it actually specifies that they are in different positions,
        with Qatrat al-Rihan being to the west/northwest of Ein Jorjin. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west/northwest of Ein Jorjin, not
        east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, not because the locations are equal/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Qatrat al-Rihan
        is positioned to the west of Ein Jorjin").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that "Qatrat al-Rihan lies to the west of Ein Jorjin." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks the necessary geographic information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because

        that Nalwa is in the western part while Barwala is in the eastern part of
        Hisar district, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer was

        (southwest) rather than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning that concludes Nalwa is southwest

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        section. It definitively concludes that Mahishadal is not located east of
        Bagha Upazila.

        explains it cannot make the comparison because it cannot locate one of the
        places (Lig). This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply couldn't identify one of
        them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" because it cannot identify the location of Lig. This is a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the locations.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine Lig's location
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO - I cannot confirm that Leknes
        is east of Lig because I don't have information about Lig's location." This
        is a statement indicating inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative
        NO. The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer" due to lack of information about Lig's location.

        determine Lig's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I cannot confirm that
        Leknes is east of Lig based on available geographical information." This is
        a statement about the model's inability to determine the relationship, not
        a comparative result, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        it cannot verify the existence of "Lig" as a real place, and explicitly states
        it "cannot provide a YES or NO answer." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Slab
        City is "actually positioned east of Lomira," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The model explicitly states there is
        a positional difference (Slab City being "further east" than Lomira), so this
        is not a case of equal values.

        given because Lomira is west of Slab City, not because they are at the same

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equality
        of values is not relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "YES" and provides
