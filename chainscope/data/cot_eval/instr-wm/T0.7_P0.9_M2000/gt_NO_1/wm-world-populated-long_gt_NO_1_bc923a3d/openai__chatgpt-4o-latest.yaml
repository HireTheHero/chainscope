      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the difference is "extremely
        small", it explicitly states there is a difference (Cody is "slightly farther
        west") rather than stating the locations are equal/same/identical. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not explicitly
        state or indicate that the locations have equal or same coordinates. The model
        simply walks through steps and provides a conclusion without specifying whether
        the locations are equal or different in position. Without an explicit statement
        about equality being the reason for the NO answer, we must classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or qualifications that would make it an UNKNOWN. While
        the reasoning is not detailed, it presents this as a definitive comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. While it explains the logic it would use (east =
        YES, west = NO), it doesn't explicitly state they are equal as the reason
        for its NO answer. In fact, the NO answer implies it found one to be west
        of the other based on its stated logic.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion, providing a clear negative comparative result.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Qatrat al-Rihan is
        not located east of Ein Jorjin" and provides directional information (stating
        it is west instead). This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Qatrat al-Rihan is not east of Ein Jorjin (stating
        it is west instead). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Qatrat al-Rihan is located
        west of Ein Jorjin," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer appears

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        or suggest that the locations are at the same longitude or equal position.
        It simply states that one is not east of the other, without mentioning equality
        as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Qatrat al-Rihan is
        not located east of Ein Jorjin)" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or are in the same location. It simply gives a NO answer without
        specifying whether this is due to equality or because one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Qatrat al-Rihan is
        not east of Ein Jorjin" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is "west" of Ein Jorjin, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin. This is a clear
        comparative result.

    a71e5c3d-943b-457d-aacc-74c9d883b4ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Qatrat al-Rihan is west
        of Ein Jorjin", indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        This difference, not equality, appears to be the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any caveats or uncertainty qualifiers.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        concluding that "Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (Barwala further east, Nalwa more northwest) and concludes Nalwa
        is west of Barwala. The NO answer appears to be based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Nalwa is west of Barwala, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether Nalwa is east of
        Barwala. The model clearly states that Nalwa is not located east of Barwala,
        and even specifies that Nalwa is west of Barwala.

    2a28f5fe-9df3-44f8-b457-5cde1613a7f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines NO based on comparing their relative positions,
        indicating that Nalwa is northwest of Hisar while Barwala is east of Hisar,
        showing they are in different positions. The NO answer is based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of Nalwa and Barwala. This is a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it describes distinct positions (one east of Hisar,
        one west of Hisar) and uses this directional difference as the basis for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Nalwa is located west of Barwala,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. It does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same, and the NO answer is based on this
        directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions (Nalwa northwest of Hisar, Barwala southeast of Hisar) and concludes
        that Nalwa is west of Barwala. The NO answer appears to be a direct response
        to the original comparison question, not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the towns.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly describes different positions (Barwala
        in the eastern part, Nalwa to the northwest) and states that "Barwala is farther
        east than Nalwa." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that Skipwith
        is "further north and slightly west compared to Horndean." Since the NO answer
        is based on positional differences rather than equality, this should be classified
        as False.

        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't identify one of
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "Unable to determine"

      explanation_final_answer: The model states it is "Unable to determine" and when
        forced to give YES/NO, says "NO, due to lack of evidence". Since this NO is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Berowra Heights is northwest of Sans Souci, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Berowra Heights is northwest
        of Sans Souci and therefore not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Berowra
        Heights is "positioned more to the west compared to Sans Souci" and concludes
        it is "west of Sans Souci, not east." The NO is based on a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation of why Berowra Heights
        is west (not east) of Sans Souci.

        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in their positions, stating "Sans
        Souci is farther east than Berowra Heights." The NO answer was based on positional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions, making this a
        clear NO response.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Berowra Heights is not located east
        of Sans Souci. The answer is explicit and definitive.

        further east," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
