        relative position (south), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear comparative result
        indicating East Garo Hills is not east of Goalpara.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Garo Hills
        is south of Goalpara, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on the fact that the relationship is south rather
        than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that East Garo Hills is
        not located east of Goalpara.

        between the locations. The NO answer was given because Laura is on the opposite
        side (west) of where the question asked about (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result to whether Laura is east
        of Carrickalinga. The answer is supported by its step-by-step analysis concluding
        that Laura is west of Carrickalinga.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, but explicitly
        states this is because one location (Slab City, Wisconsin) does not exist.
        When a model rejects the premises of the question by stating one of the compared
        items doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        being equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are different,
        with Mad River being "west of Lookingglass." The NO is given because Mad River
        is described as being in the opposite direction (west) from what was asked
        (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because El Quisco
        is explicitly stated to be west of Hopkinton, indicating a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, providing a clear directional reasoning that
        El Quisco is west of Hopkinton, not east.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        Hougang was determined to be south-east rather than purely east of the North
        Region. The model identified a directional difference (south-east vs east)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
