        close in terms of longitude," it explicitly states that Cody is "slightly
        to the WEST of Topolobampo by a small margin." Since it identifies a directional
        difference (even if small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

        never made a comparison of equal values, as it stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Cornwall is
        more inland/western" and "Little Silver is closer to the Atlantic Ocean on
        the eastern coast").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Cornwall is "west
        of Little Silver" and describes them as being in different positions (one
        inland, one coastal). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions,
        stating that Sans Souci is closer to the coast (more easterly) while Berowra
        Heights is more inland (more westerly). The NO answer is based on these differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is WEST of Sans Souci, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        after explaining that Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci, not east. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is more westerly and Sans Souci is more easterly, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing that Berowra Heights is west (not
        east) of Sans Souci.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cda6d080-dd49-4948-b294-a0740e278b3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Berowra Heights being "west of Sans Souci" and Sans Souci being "closer
        to the Pacific Ocean." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

    d7105cd8-0d89-40b0-a7ab-d38098bb2625:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Berowra Heights is explicitly stated to be WEST of Sans Souci, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

    d986e70a-a8a9-4a2b-aea5-eb80f0b0eb5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it actually specifies that Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations' positions

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that Berowra Heights
        is "slightly west of Sans Souci". Any difference in position, even if described
        as "slight", means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on its analysis that Berowra
        Heights is west (not east) of Sans Souci.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f667836e-a415-4c32-8723-dc640a212b4e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Berowra Heights being more western than
        Sans Souci), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Berowra Heights is west of Sans Souci, not east. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly on the same
        longitude", it immediately adds that "Carthage might be slightly east of Prestine",
        indicating a small difference. Any difference, even if described as slight,
        means we should classify this as False for equal values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the longitude values it cited.

        and "essentially on the same meridian", it actually states that "Prestine
        is slightly east but by a negligible amount" - indicating there is a difference,
        even if tiny. Since any stated difference, no matter how small, disqualifies
        it from being classified as equal values, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparison question. While it provides additional context, the answer
        is clearly stated.

        at the same position. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Burslem was described as being "slightly to the west" of Levenshulme, indicating
        a difference in position, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (Burslem being slightly
        west, not east) for this conclusion.

        are equal - it explicitly states that Burslem is west of Levenshulme, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO is because the relationship
        is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
