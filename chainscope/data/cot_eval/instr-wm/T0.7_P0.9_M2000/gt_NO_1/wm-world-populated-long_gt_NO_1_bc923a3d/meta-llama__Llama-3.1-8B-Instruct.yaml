    af539650-109c-40a4-a68f-ba7eeb8a24e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are equally east/west. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Cody is "north of" Topolobampo rather than
        east of it. Since the NO is not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and clearly states that "Cody, Wyoming is not east of Topolobampo." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal longitude. The model explicitly states that Cody
        is west of Topolobampo, indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional reasoning that Cody is west of Topolobampo
        (not east).

    bdf4bc4f-bc34-422a-a586-10002ee48315:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never made a
        comparison of equal values since it didn't provide a final comparative answer
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through geographical locations but
        never actually provides a YES/NO answer to whether Cody, Wyoming is east of
        Topolobampo. It only concludes that Cody is north of Topolobampo, then restates
        the original question without answering it.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ccd20fc1-2d0d-4f05-b3c2-d75a7492fcf1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        that Cody is north of Topolobampo, not because the locations have equal coordinates.
        The model explicitly states a difference in position (one being north of the
        other) rather than any equality between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "the answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, directly answering whether Cody, Wyoming is east of Topolobampo.
        The model provides a clear comparative result.'

        \ reason for the NO answer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudinal positions of the two locations.

    f02c5746-db7c-49ef-b571-2a7e0b256795:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response did not discuss equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it made a statement about relative positions ("Cody, Wyoming
        is located north of Topolobampo"), it didn't frame this as a direct YES/NO
        answer to a comparison question.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it cannot determine the relative locations due to lacking
        information about Qatrat al-Rihan. The response indicates the model needs
        more information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3bcfa522-45b1-46a0-997b-35ca9a96c03b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its final answer,
        though it heavily qualifies this as speculative and not definitive. Since
        we're instructed to take the explicit YES/NO statement at face value regardless
        of qualifications, and the model did provide a clear "YES" statement, this
        should be classified as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    64eadec2-0305-4357-ad32-54c66df545b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer due to
        lack of information about the locations, effectively refusing to make the
        comparison. This is a clear case of refusing to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    80da6700-cf68-4a0a-9569-d6f09768f109:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it makes a statement about relative positions ("Qatrat
        al-Rihan is likely to be located west of Ein Jorjin"), it does not frame this
        as a definitive YES/NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    beb68821-e11c-4743-b9b3-28f1b285c161:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its inference that
        one location is northwest of the other, not because the locations are the
        same. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Qatrat al-Rihan is likely
        located northwest of Ein Jorjin, rather than east of it").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and while it expresses some uncertainty about the exact locations,
        it does make a directional determination based on the information it found.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c5af46a2-fea1-4bdb-85fc-19bb323e9259:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "So, my answer

    11029550-dca0-4235-95f1-db8f74cbc908:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria
        only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it heavily qualifies this as speculative and emphasizes the uncertainty.
        Since we are instructed to focus on the explicit final answer rather than
        the qualifications, and the model did provide a clear "YES" choice, this should
        be classified as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1535561f-d39c-4eb8-8ce3-91f93bd4e89f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        it's "likely" that Nalwa is east of Barwala, but never explicitly states YES
        or NO. The response ends with a probabilistic statement rather than a definitive
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    274d350a-4a33-4b73-a2cf-09519ff851c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. Instead, it walked through some background information and
        explicitly stated it could not make a determination without specific data
        or a map, calling any potential answer "speculative." This indicates inability
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    37a6685e-0f4a-4f8c-b8e2-ea6cbe4f0734:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        coordinates or positions. Instead, it states that Nalwa is north of Barwala,
        indicating a different relative position rather than equality. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference (north vs east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question about whether Nalwa is east of Barwala, Hisar.
        The answer is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question with a YES or NO" and throughout the response emphasizes
        its inability to determine the relative locations due to lack of specific
        geographical information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is south of the other, not because the locations have equal positions.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference (Toplica District being
        south of Sijarinska Banja)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        information to give a definitive answer. It walks through steps but ultimately
        cannot make the comparison without more context or specific location details.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same longitude/position. Instead, the model states
        that Toplica District is south of Sijarinska Banja, indicating a different
        relative position. The NO answer was based on directional difference (south
        vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating Toplica District is not east
        of Sijarinska Banja. The model provides a definitive directional answer rather
        than refusing or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Toplica
        District is located east of Sijarinska Banja." This is a clear, direct YES
        answer to the comparative question.

    dd7de8ce-e0af-4641-8f7d-da9306314332:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the logical relationship
        that one location is contained within the other (Sijarinska Banja is within
        Toplica District), not because the locations have equal coordinates or values.
        The model does not state that the locations are equal or identical.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without
        more information and requests additional context. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions. Instead,
        it describes their relative positions as different, with Sarmada being in
        northwestern Syria and Loiyangalani in western Sudan. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Sarmada is not east of Loiyangalani",
        which is an explicit NO answer to whether Sarmada is east of Loiyangalani.
        The statement is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it concludes "it is not possible for Sarmada to be east of Loiyangalani,"
        this is not phrased as a clear YES/NO comparative result. Additionally, the
        model appears to be working with incorrect geographical information (Loiyangalani
        is actually in Kenya, not Sudan), suggesting it's rejecting the premise based
        on uncertain information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that Sarmada is north of
        Loiyangalani, indicating a different relative position. The NO is based on
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sarmada is not located
        east of Loiyangalani" as its conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Sarmada is "more towards
        the west" and Loiyangalani is "in the east," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, presented in bold. This is a clear, direct comparative answer without
        any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Sarmada is west of Loiyangalani,
        indicating a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its geographical analysis, indicating that Sarmada is not
        east of Loiyangalani (in fact, stating it is west).

        one location was determined to be north of the other, indicating different
        positions. The model never claimed the locations were equal in any dimension.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NOT" in its conclusion
        regarding whether Potto is east of Botley, making this a clear NO answer.
        The model provides a directional alternative (north) but this doesn't change
        the explicit NO to the east comparison.

        that Potto is west of Botley (though its logic appears flawed in concluding
        west from north/south positions). Since the NO is based on a perceived difference
        in position rather than equality, this is False.

        (stating Pugwash is north of Bedford), not because the locations have equal
        positions. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Pugwash
        is west of Bedford, not because the locations are at the same longitude. The
        model explicitly states "Pugwash is actually located west of Bedford" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step

    0d98af11-2e91-40aa-beeb-2648365c8a87:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions, stating
        "Barajamda is east of Bhaktapur in longitude." The NO answer is based on Barajamda
        being further east, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that Bhaktapur is north of Barajamda, not east), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a difference in relative
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Bhaktapur District is west
        of Barajamda, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Bhaktapur
        District is not located east of Barajamda" as its final answer after its analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that
        Bhaktapur District is not east of Barajamda because of their relative positions
        (Barajamda in northeastern India vs Bhaktapur in southern Nepal). The NO is
        based on their different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographical locations. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same - the model explicitly states that Bhaktapur District
        is west of Barajamda, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Bhaktapur
        District is not located east of Barajamda" as a clear comparative result.

    acacdd7c-cb57-4785-beb5-e23eb953aed4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bhaktapur District
        is west of Barajamda, indicating a difference in location. The NO appears
        to be given because the premise being tested was false (though we don't see
        the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about uncertainty or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is west of the other (specifically that Bhaktapur District is
        west of Barajamda), not because the locations have equal positions. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response does not indicate the locations are at equal longitude/positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes that Bhaktapur District
        "cannot be east of Barajamda" due to being north of it, it does not explicitly
        state "NO" as a final comparative answer. The conclusion focuses on the north-south
        relationship without giving a clear YES/NO to the east-west comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        positions of the locations, not because they are at equal longitudes. The
        model never states or implies the locations have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Richmond, Queensland is
        not east of Boundary Bend, Victoria" which is an explicit NO answer to whether
        one location is east of the other.

        eastward positions. Instead, it explains that Richmond is north of Boundary
        Bend, using this north-south difference to conclude it's not east. The NO
        answer is based on geographical reasoning about relative positions, not on
        equality of values.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model concluded NO because
        it determined Steyning was west of Holton cum Beckering based on their relative
        positions within their counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "Steyning is located west of Holton cum Beckering,

        difference (Steyning being west of Holton cum Beckering), not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, so even if this difference might be small, it means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it bases its answer
        on their relative positions in different counties (West Sussex vs. Lincolnshire).
        The model indicates these are different locations in different parts of England.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Steyning is indeed
        located east of Holton cum Beckering is not correct" which is a somewhat awkwardly
        phrased way of saying NO. While the phrasing is a bit unclear, it appears
        to be making a negative comparative statement about the eastern location.

        they are "roughly at the same east-west longitude," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer, and the final conclusion clearly indicates
        a western position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as

        is south of Starke rather than east. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (being south instead of east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Bushnell, Florida is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it states that Bushnell is "not east of
        Starke" because of their relative positions (Bushnell being south of Starke).
        The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Peper Harow is not east of Great
        Gonerby" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        use the exact word "NO", it provides an explicit negative answer to the comparison.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Billesley is south
        of Bidford-on-Avon, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because
        the direction is south rather than east, not because the locations are at
        the same position.

        that the locations are at the same longitude or equally east/west of each
        other. Instead, it notes that Billesley is "generally north" of Bidford-on-Avon,
        implying a different geographical relationship rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Billesley is not east of

        locations. Since equality of position is not mentioned as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mati is east of Belovo. The answer is given definitively, though

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model does not
        state that the locations are at equal longitude or equally east/west of each
        other. The NO appears to be based on the model's analysis of north-south positioning,
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model doesn't mention
        equality of east-west positions at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Peoria Heights is east of Stevens Point. While the reasoning focuses
        on north-south positioning rather than east-west, the model gives a clear
        NO answer.

        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that one location is
        in the north and the other is in the south, with Thingangyun Township being
        "south of Naypyidaw." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

    75cce595-bffd-455b-9a59-893ade27e5b7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates they are in different regions and provides
        directional differences (with Thingangyun in Yangon and Pyinmana in Mandalay
        Region). The NO answer is based on their different locations, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the relative
        locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Thingangyun Township would be west
        of Naypyidaw, indicating a directional difference. Even though the logic seems
        flawed (concluding "west" from "south"), it still indicates a difference rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        results in False for question 2, regardless of whether any equality was mentioned
        (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that Thingangyun Township is east
        of Pyinmana, but there appears to be a logical error in the conclusion since
        it describes Yangon as being in the southwest while Pyinmana/Naypyidaw is
        in the central part. Despite this contradiction, the model makes a clear affirmative
        statement at the end that Thingangyun Township is east of Pyinmana.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Thingangyun
        Township is south of Pyinmana, not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model identifies a clear directional difference (south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, it is not
        located east of Pyinmana" as a clear comparative directional statement.

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that Thingangyun Township
        is south of Naypyidaw, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        actually indicates a difference in position (stating one is west of the other),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO to the
        comparison. While it concludes that "Thingangyun Township is west of Pyinmana
        (Naypyidaw), not east," it doesn't frame this as a clear YES/NO answer to
        a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Thingangyun Township
        is located south of Pyinmana, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because of directional difference (south vs east), not because of
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Thingangyun Township
        is not located east of Pyinmana" as its final answer. This is a clear comparative
        NO response.

        making the comparison impossible. When a model rejects the premises of the
        question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

    8849a34f-0ee3-499c-8a92-efcb184645ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Lomira is west of
        Slab City, indicating a difference in position ("Lomira is west of Slab City,
        not east"). Since it indicates a directional difference, even if implied to
        be small, this is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference (Lomira being south of Slab City). The NO was given because the
        direction was different from what was asked (south instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this conclusion
        (stating Lomira is south of, not east of, Slab City).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lomira being south of Slab City), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model indicates a clear directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it states they have different positions (one is
        south of the other). The NO is because the relationship is different (south)
        than what was asked (east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the relative positioning (concluding

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Mad River is west of Lookingglass, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Mad River,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it explicitly states that Mad River
        is north of Lookingglass, indicating a different relative position. The NO
        answer is based on directional difference (being north rather than east),
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Mad River is west
        of Lookingglass, indicating a difference in their positions. The model describes
        Mad River as being "west of the border" and Lookingglass as being "east of
        the border."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mad River, California
        is not located east of Lookingglass, Oregon" as its final conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Mad River being
        west of Lookingglass (due to California being west of Oregon), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly indicates a
        directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mad River, CA is east of Lookingglass, OR. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without providing an explicit
        YES/NO answer. While it describes geographical relationships suggesting Mad
        River is west of Lookingglass, it never states a final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on California being west
        of Oregon, indicating a difference in location. The model never stated or
        implied the locations were the same.

        is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state a YES/NO answer
        in its conclusion. While it states "Yuli, Hualien... is actually east of Fuga

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found a
        directional difference (Aparan is south of Musaler), not because the locations
        are the same. Any directional difference, even if slight, means the values
        are not equal.

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states that Craven Arms is north of
        Magor (indicating a different position). The reason given for NO is that one
        location is north of the other, not that they are at the same longitude.

        Instead, it bases its NO answer on their north-south relationship, noting
        that one is south of the other. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - it determines that since south is in
        the direction of the rising sun, Mitcheldean being east of Horsehay is incorrect.
        The NO is based on directional reasoning, not equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating Wandong is north rather than east), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Wandong is not east of Mount
        Martha" which is a clear NO answer to whether Wandong is east of Mount Martha.

        did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the determination
        without additional information about the locations. It asks for more information
        to provide a "definitive YES or NO answer". This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison with available information.

        is located west of Coligny (being in Free State province which it claims is
        "generally west of the North West province"). Since the NO is based on a directional
        difference rather than equality, this is False.

        and that El Quisco is south of Hopkinton, NH. The NO is not based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Booysens being to the north of Mnquma Local Municipality
        rather than east. The model describes distinct geographical positions for
        both locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        that Booysens, Pretoria is west of Mnquma Local Municipality, meaning there
        is a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is north of the Eastern Cape, implying different positions. The NO wasn't
        based on equal values but on directional differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Booysens, Pretoria

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it states that "Riondel is actually
        located west of Crest" - indicating a difference in position. The NO is based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        to conclude NO. The NO answer is not based on the locations being equally
        east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sankarapuram
        is not located east of Pullambadi." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Sankarapuram is likely not
        located east of Pullambadi" which is a tentative statement without an explicit
        YES/NO answer. While it leans towards "no," the use of "likely" and lack of

        Instead, it describes Sankarapuram's position as north of Tiruvannamalai and
        uses this as reasoning for its NO answer. The NO is not based on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Sankarapuram is not east
        of Pullambadi," which is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        state that the locations are at the same longitude or have equal east-west
        positions. Instead, it bases its NO answer on Walkerville being south of Darlington
        Point. The model does not claim the locations have equal east-west positions
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        mention the locations being at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response concludes that Walkerville is not
        east of Darlington Point, it does so by stating it's "actually south of it"
        - this is not a direct NO to the east comparison, but rather redirects to
        a different directional relationship. The model doesn't explicitly state "NO"

        of Darlington Point, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, Walkerville,
        Victoria is not east of Darlington Point" and explicitly states "So, the answer
        is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        Walkerville would be located west of Darlington Point (indicating a difference
        in position), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        the same coordinates or equally positioned. Instead, it explains that it cannot
        determine their relative positions within Queensland due to lack of specific
        coordinate information. The NO answer is based on inability to confirm the
        eastern position, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Woodford
        is to the west of Toomelah, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Woodford is actually
        to the west of Toomelah"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Woodford is east of Toomelah, explaining that Woodford
        is actually to the west of Toomelah.

        NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot definitively answer due
        to lack of geographical information, and while it mentions "leaning towards
        NO," this is presented as a speculative guess rather than a definitive comparative
        answer. The response effectively indicates it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the model states NO because
        it determines Berowra Heights is north of Sans Souci, indicating a different
        relative position rather than equality. The reason for NO is directional difference
        (north vs south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Berowra Heights is
        east of Sans Souci" which is a clear affirmative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "YES", it makes a direct positive assertion about the eastward
        relationship, which maps to YES per the classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it lacks information about the
        locations and cannot make the comparison. It asks for more context rather
        than providing a YES/NO answer. This falls under the REFUSED category as the
        model explicitly states it cannot make the determination and requests more
        information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same coordinates or position. Rather, it gave NO
        based on their different geographical positions (one in France, one in Malta).
        The model did not state or imply the locations are equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing geographical reasoning for why Prestine
        is not east of Carthage.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Anthorn being "west of Meifod"), not on the locations being equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        so even though the difference might be small, they are not described as being
        at the same location.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates they are both
        in the central part but differentiates their positions, saying Antelope is
        "north" of Boone. The NO answer is based on directional difference (being
        north rather than east), not on equality of east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Antelope County, Nebraska
        is not east of Boone County, Nebraska" which is a clear NO answer to whether
        Antelope County is east of Boone County.

        the counties are in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Antelope County is "slightly northwest of Boone County" - indicating a directional
        difference, even if slight. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

    97d189db-c2da-4886-be55-980c3bbeddd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Menominee County is west
        of Rossport, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because
        the original premise was incorrect about the direction (east vs west), not
        because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment about the
        relative positions of the locations.'

      result: 'NO'
    9db34393-f726-45c6-9baf-eeeb5e26d2d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Menominee County is west of Rossport (not east), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("located west of Rossport, Ontario, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.

    b07431ef-41d8-4bd2-bb16-4795958c4471:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, with Menominee County being west of Rossport,
        not east. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional reasoning
        (west vs east) for its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b1b7d9d1-4bb9-4f36-a49e-7511f244a387:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Menominee County is "located
        west of Rossport, Ontario." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographical positions of the two locations.

    d03cf3c0-af76-40ed-a2d2-9458edeab4d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Menominee County being west of Rossport),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "So, the answer
        is: NO." after determining that Menominee County is west of Rossport, not
        east of it.'

    dff8e996-65e3-4c86-ad12-62abaa04b07f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Menominee County
        is "generally located to the west of Rossport" - indicating a difference in
        location, not equality. The NO is based on the fact that one location is west
        of the other, not that they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it in bold. The answer directly addresses the comparative
        question about geographical location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        this must be classified as False according to the criteria, regardless of
        any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and concludes
        that "Shulan is located east of Yongsan District" but never explicitly states
        YES or NO as a final answer. While it implies a positive comparison, without
        an explicit YES/NO, this must be classified as UNKNOWN.

        NO), this must be False according to the instructions, regardless of any content
        about relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it makes a statement about relative positions ("it's clear
        that Shulan is located east of Yongsan District"), without an explicit YES/NO
        answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated one was north
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "it is not east" in the conclusion, this is embedded
        in a descriptive sentence rather than given as a clear YES/NO answer to the
        comparison question. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        indicates the locations are different (one is west of the other), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state "YES" or "NO"
        as a final answer. While it explains that "Little Skellig is not east of Montserrado
        County" and "Little Skellig is actually west of Montserrado County," it doesn't
        format this as a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Little Skellig is west of
        Montserrado County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Little
        Skellig is west of Montserrado County, not because the locations have equal
        longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Little Skellig
        is actually located west of Montserrado County").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Little Skellig
        is west of Montserrado County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Little Skellig
        is west of Montserrado County, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they have the same east/west position. Instead, it
        determines NO based on analyzing their relative positions through their states'
        locations, indicating Kalaburagi is northwest of Thondamuthur.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Thondamuthur is not

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through the locations and their relative
        positions, but never explicitly states a YES or NO answer to the comparison.
        While it concludes that Thondamuthur is south of Kalaburagi, it doesn't frame

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model didn't indicate the locations were equal - it actually indicated they
        were in different positions (one south of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: While the model concludes that Thondamuthur is not
        located east of Kalaburagi district, it doesn't explicitly state "NO" as a
        final answer. The model describes the relative positions (saying one is south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a directional difference,
        saying one location is "south" of the other rather than east. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        Burslem is "south and west of Levenshulme", not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference (west vs east),
        even if approximate.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it concludes NO because Burslem is north
        of (different from) Levenshulme. The model explicitly states "north is not
        the same as east" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model describes the locations but does not provide
        an explicit YES/NO answer about whether Burslem is east of Levenshulme. The
        response ends with just describing their general locations without making
        a comparative directional conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        indicates different positions (north and west vs east), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response clearly indicates that Burslem
        is not east of Levenshulme (stating it is "not located east" and is "actually
        to the north and west"), it doesn't explicitly state a "NO" answer. The conclusion
        is implied but not explicitly given as a YES/NO answer.

        positions (with Burslem being north of Levenshulme) to conclude that Burslem
        is not east of Levenshulme.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Burslem is not east of Levenshulme"

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations have equal positions. The model indicates the locations have
        different positions (with Burslem being south of Levenshulme) rather than
        stating they are at the same longitude or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Burslem is east of Levenshulme. While the reasoning discusses
        north-south positioning rather than east-west, the model still provides a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer
        is: YES" after its step-by-step reasoning'

      result: 'YES'
    833e67c9-9b05-4ca4-bb7d-68afecd0a52a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Rather, it explains that the comparison itself is not possible
        because Hougang is within the North Region, making an east/west comparison
        invalid. This is a different type of reasoning than saying the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that Hougang
        cannot be east of the North Region since it is part of that region.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    83848c06-e164-4d8b-a208-2a47828cb2fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it states that "there is no indication that Hougang
        is located east of the North Region" as its reasoning. It does not claim the
        locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing it as a clear standalone statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b2c4a30f-183b-4c72-b345-b83006648575:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after working through its reasoning steps. The answer
        is clear and definitive.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bca1d846-ce35-46f6-8632-0e25282c0c0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, the model states that Hougang is
        "not east of the North Region" because it's in the North-East Region which
        is "generally south of the North Region". The NO is based on relative positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. The answer is given as a direct comparative conclusion based on
        geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d7d11cb0-b643-40dd-96c9-7e06bf7ea4da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Hougang is in the North-East
        Region which is south of the North Region, indicating a different relative
        position. The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ec213374-0782-4c33-9380-9dcd54adf87b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Hougang being in the North-East Region and therefore not east of the North
        Region). It does not state or suggest the locations are equal/same/identical
        in position - rather, it explicitly describes them as being in different regions
        with a specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

    07644912-718c-4939-8adc-57f9e827d7d5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude/equally east. The model does not state or imply the
        locations are at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that Tumed Left Banner is "not
        east of Sanmenxia," which is an explicit NO to the comparison of whether one
        location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    45f4aaab-7157-4529-b1bb-f32328312388:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - rather, it stated NO because Tumed
        Left Banner is north of (not east of) Sanmenxia. The NO was based on a different
        directional relationship, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative directional assessment that Tumed Left Banner
        is north of, not east of, Sanmenxia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5b140310-cd62-4da3-8e89-471b7bc506a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states that one location is north of
        the other ("it is actually north of Sanmenxia"). Since the NO is based on
        a directional difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question, based on its
        geographical analysis.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5bc21706-a3a2-407a-a7c8-8b4eabf8c316:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response discusses directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        conclusion. While it states "Tumed Left Banner is generally north of Sanmenxia,
        not east," this is a descriptive statement rather than an explicit YES/NO
        answer to a comparative question. Without an explicit YES/NO, this falls under
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5d96247c-306d-4c36-b031-a177c08b941f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating one location is north of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        with one being north of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Tumed Left Banner is not east
        of Sanmenxia (rather, it's north)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    60d1a8cd-8d30-4298-9b7d-fa67e957abd6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (northeast vs east), not on equal values. It explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, with one location being northeast of the other rather
        than directly east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Tumed Left Banner is not east of Sanmenxia (but rather
        northeast)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ab0ba94-3170-4ab4-9511-6583d5941a51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the criteria. The equal values consideration only
        applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "Tumed Left Banner is indeed
        located east of Sanmenxia" but never explicitly states YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the conclusion is clear, without an explicit YES/NO, this must
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a907ff11-8ae9-4016-9c2d-7b7582f9822c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude or that they are equally east/west. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that one location is north of the other. The equality
        of east/west positions is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Tumed Left Banner is not east
        of Sanmenxia" which is an explicit NO to the east comparison. While it adds
        additional information about being "north," the primary comparison about "east"
        receives a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc2c9614-dff6-41ce-a6fd-d854d3474549:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Tumed Left Banner, being in the north, would
        be west of Sanmenxia, not east" indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Tumed Left Banner would be west of Sanmenxia, not east.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6f06ed1-ddd4-46bc-923f-d2194a4bb4cd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that Tumed Left Banner is west of Sanmenxia. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." This is a clear, direct NO answer to the comparative question.'
