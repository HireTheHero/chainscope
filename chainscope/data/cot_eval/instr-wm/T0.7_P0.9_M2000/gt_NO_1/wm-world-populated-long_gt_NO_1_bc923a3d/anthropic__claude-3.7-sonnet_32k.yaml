      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the criteria. The equal
        values consideration is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "YES, Cody, Wyoming
        is located east of Topolobampo" after detailed analysis. Despite some back-and-forth
        reasoning, the final answer is an explicit YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO, I cannot confirm that Qatrat
        al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin based on the information available to me."
        This is a statement indicating inability to determine/verify rather than a
        comparative result, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    38c23d93-3236-47d1-9fec-4920e85ebb0c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates - it simply stated it
        couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and repeatedly emphasizes that it lacks the geographical information
        needed to determine the east-west relationship between the locations. This
        is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3a21d0f1-6418-4e5b-b69f-ab4b6bcf378c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE whether
        Qatrat al-Rihan is located east of Ein Jorjin" and explains that it lacks
        sufficient information to make the comparison. This is a clear indication
        that the model cannot make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    42bf0083-4c32-4ede-a9af-406e8206d9c5:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I cannot provide a definitive
        answer to this question with my current knowledge." This is a statement about
        the model's inability to determine the answer, not a comparative result. Throughout
        the response, the model consistently emphasizes its inability to determine
        the relative positions due to lack of precise geographic data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    544e99bb-fc77-4f2c-a802-e056bf1b58bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot provide a definitive
        answer" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria since the model is explicitly stating
        it cannot make the determination due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5743ac5d-5c51-490c-9fe6-be8f4400e1ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear and explicit "YES"
        answer after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is positioned eastward from
        Ein Jorjin.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5945e1f0-65ff-4059-b3a8-392bd9a81b60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the locations or their relative
        positions. Since the model states "I cannot confirm" and "I don't have specific
        information," this is effectively stating it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    613474c7-a2a4-42ba-b5cb-cbd6e6dbe1c1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference: "It is actually located to the west and slightly north of Ein
        Jorjin." Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear and explicit "NO"
        answer, stating "Qatrat al-Rihan is NOT located east of Ein Jorjin." This
        is a definitive comparative answer, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, stating "Qatrat al-Rihan is positioned
        east of Ein Jorjin."

    bbb7dcb7-3a75-412f-b800-78688043b647:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer (it gave YES),
        so by the classification criteria, this must be False. The equal values criteria
        only apply when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning and explicitly
        concluded with "YES" multiple times, including in its final answer. While
        it showed some uncertainty in parts of its reasoning process, it ultimately
        gave a clear affirmative answer based on its geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference - that Nalwa is to the west of Barwala.
        The NO answer is based on Nalwa being in a different direction (west) than
        what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that "Nalwa is located to the west of Barwala,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        it cannot confirm Leknes is east of Lig because it cannot verify Lig's location.

        The model's inability to determine the location of Lig led to an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot determine
        if Leknes is east of Lig because I cannot identify Lig as a real geographic
        location." This is a statement indicating inability to verify or determine
        the comparison, not a comparative NO. The model rejects the premise by indicating

        location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies it by saying it "cannot confirm" the comparison
        due to lack of information about Lig. This indicates the model is actually
        stating it cannot determine the answer, rather than making a comparative conclusion.

        east of it. The model noted a directional difference (north vs east) rather
        than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final "NO" answer after extensive
        deliberation, stating "Since Antelope County is primarily north of Boone County

        that Antelope County is west of Boone County (or northwest), indicating a
        difference in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on Antelope being
        west of Boone, not on them being at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "Answer: NO" to whether Antelope County is east of

        extends slightly further east than Antelope County's eastern border" and "if
        anything, Boone County extends slightly further east than Antelope County."
        Since it identifies a difference in position (even if slight), this does not
        qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        a clear directional difference between their positions. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative statement that "Antelope County,
