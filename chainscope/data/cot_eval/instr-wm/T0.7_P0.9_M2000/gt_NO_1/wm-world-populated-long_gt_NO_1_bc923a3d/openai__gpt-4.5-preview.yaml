      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different directional relationship
        as the reason for its NO answer. Specifically, it states that "Yuli, Hualien
        is positioned north of Fuga Island, not east of it." The model is claiming
        that the directional relationship is north/south rather than east/west, not
        that the locations are at the same longitude or latitude.

        The model clearly rejects the comparison suggested in the prompt (that Booysens,
        Pretoria is east of Mnquma Local Municipality) and instead concludes that
        "Booysens, Pretoria is located WEST, not east, of Mnquma Local Municipality."

        is either very close to or slightly west of Rossport, Ontario." The model
        suggests Menominee County is "either directly south (almost same longitude)

        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tumed Left Banner is located
        to the northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Tumed Left Banner is likely
        northwest or north of Sanmenxia, not east. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (northwest/north vs east), not on equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating that "Tumed Left Banner would clearly be west (and north) of Sanmenxia,
        not east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Tumed Left Banner, being in Inner Mongolia
        (to the northwest), would be located west or northwest of Sanmenxia, not east."
        The model is indicating a geographical difference in position, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tumed Left Banner
        is located to the northwest or at least west of Sanmenxia, indicating a directional
        difference. The model concludes that "Tumed Left Banner is not located east
        of Sanmenxia" because it's in the opposite direction (northwest/west).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        on this directional difference (northwest vs east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
