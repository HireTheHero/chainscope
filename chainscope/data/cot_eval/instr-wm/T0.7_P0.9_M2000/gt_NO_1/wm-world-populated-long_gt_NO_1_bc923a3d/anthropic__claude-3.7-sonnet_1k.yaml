        the model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply
        stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO", it immediately clarifies
        that this means "I cannot confirm" and explicitly states it cannot determine
        the relative positions. This makes it a case of being unable to verify/determine

    2451ca5c-55f6-46b2-97d7-da9dc4265da0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Nalwa is "slightly to the east
        compared to Barwala," indicating a difference in position, even if small.
        The NO appears to be a direct response to whether Nalwa is east of Barwala,
        not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its thinking process, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer based on
        its analysis that Nalwa is "slightly to the east compared to Barwala."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with Nalwa being south/southwest of Barwala. The NO is based on
        Nalwa being in a different direction (south/southwest) rather than east, not
        because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of Nalwa and Barwala. The answer
        is explicit and comparative, stating that Nalwa is not east of Barwala but
        rather south/southwest.

        is a difference in position, noting that "Nalwa is slightly to the west of
        Barwala on the east-west axis." Since it indicates a directional difference
        (even if described as "slight"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer
        is clear and direct, stating that Nalwa is not east of Barwala.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Nalwa is "west/southwest of Barwala" and provides directional differences
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Nalwa
        is not located east of Barwala, Hisar" as its final answer. This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions, with Steyning being west of Holton cum
        Beckering. The model never states or suggests the locations are at equal/same
        positions. Rather, it explicitly states a directional difference (one is west
        of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Steyning
        is not located east of Holton cum Beckering. It is located west of it." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

    16c994a8-8f1d-4dcd-bfcc-86eec7b52116:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Holton cum Beckering is east of Steyning
        (and Steyning is west of Holton cum Beckering). The NO is based on the opposite
        directional relationship being true, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Steyning is NOT east of Holton cum Beckering,
        but rather west of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Steyning is southwest
        of Holton cum Beckering, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Steyning is not east of Holton cum Beckering. The

        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Holton cum
        Beckering is east of Steyning, and Steyning is "to the west and south of Holton
        cum Beckering." The NO is based on a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Steyning is not east of Holton cum Beckering.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Steyning
        is west of Holton cum Beckering, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Steyning is
        west of Holton cum Beckering" and "Holton cum Beckering is further east than
        Steyning").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Steyning is west of Holton cum Beckering, not east of it. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it lacks information about one of the locations (Lig). This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" because it cannot verify the location of Lig. The model

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Leknes
        is east of Lig because I don't have information about where Lig is located."
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one location, making this an UNKNOWN response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with Bushnell being west of Starke.
        The model never states or suggests the locations are at the same longitude
        or equal position - instead it explicitly describes their different positions.
        The NO is because Bushnell is west of Starke, not because they're at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Bushnell is not east of Starke. The answer
        is direct and comparative, with no caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that
        Starke is east of Bushnell, with Bushnell being more toward the western side
        and Starke more toward the eastern side. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of Bushnell and Starke, Florida. The
        model concludes that Starke is east of Bushnell, not the other way around,
        providing a direct comparative answer.

        the west of Starke, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        more to the southwest of Matsudo." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Urayasu is southwest of Matsudo, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Urayasu being in a different direction
        (southwest) than what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Urayasu is southwest of Matsudo
        (not east of it). This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats
        about uncertainty or inability to determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Lomira,
        Wisconsin is located east of Slab City, Wisconsin." after working through
        the relative positions of both locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, determining that Lomira is further east than Slab City.
        Despite some initial uncertainty and a contradictory preliminary analysis
        in the first thinking section, the final explicit answer was YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    40a89509-af0c-4185-afa8-bdb04101bac0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying "Lomira is west of Slab City." The NO
        was based on the direction being opposite to what was asked, not because the
        locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "NO, Lomira
        is not east of Slab City" and provided a comparative direction ("Lomira is
        west of Slab City"). This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Lomira being west of Slab City. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lomira is not east of
        Slab City, Wisconsin" and provides a definitive comparative result, saying
        "Lomira is actually west of Slab City."
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that Lomira is located to the west
        of Slab City. The NO answer was given because of this directional difference,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after working through the locations step by step. The answer
        was clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aeeecdc1-1432-4298-a070-97b9ca95c5d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lomira
        is west of Slab City, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lomira is
        actually located WEST of Slab City"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Lomira is west of Slab City, not east of it. This is a clear comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b8c4ee65-a2b0-422c-88e7-068005efadad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Slab City is further east than Lomira,
        with Lomira being west of Slab City. The NO is based on a difference in positions,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Lomira is NOT east of Slab City, but rather west of it."
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c004b370-fc82-460c-9f5c-c75252ffc910:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Slab City is "slightly further east than
        Lomira". This difference in position, even though described as "slight", means
        the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Slab City is actually slightly further east than Lomira, making a clear
        comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f20c3ac5-9135-481e-ad95-ea29b309b93d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model's reasoning was about inability to verify existence of one location,
        not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm that Lomira
        is east of Slab City, Wisconsin, because I don't have information confirming
        the existence of a Slab City in Wisconsin." This is a case where the model
        rejects the premise by indicating one of the locations doesn't exist, making
        it impossible to determine the comparison. Per the instructions, when a model
        rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine/verify, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated that one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by stating that one of the locations (Slab City, Wisconsin) doesn't exist,
        making it impossible to make the comparison. This is a case where the model
        rejects the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Craven Arms is northwest of Magor, with Magor being further
        east. This difference in position, not equality, is given as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Craven Arms is
        not east of Magor. The model explains that Craven Arms is actually northwest
        of Magor.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Branchville being
        west of Vincentown, not on them being at the same location. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with Branchville being "further
        west" and in the "northwestern region" while Vincentown is "more toward the
        central/eastern part." Since the NO is based on this directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends its response
        with "NO" after explaining that Branchville is west of Vincentown, not east
        of it. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Burslem is west of Levenshulme, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on Burslem being in the opposite direction
        (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Burslem is not east of Levenshulme. The
        model provides a clear directional comparison showing Burslem is west of Levenshulme.

        and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even
        though both are in the North West of England, the model identifies a specific
        directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Burslem is west of Levenshulme,
        not east.

        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Burslem
        is west of Levenshulme ("Burslem, being part of Stoke-on-Trent, is therefore
        west of Levenshulme, not east"). This indicates a clear directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that Burslem is not east of Levenshulme (in fact stating
        it is west). This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

        a direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives specific longitude values (111\xB0\
        E vs 111.2\xB0E), it explicitly states there is a difference (\"slightly west\"\
        ) rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,\
        \ not on the values being equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Tumed Left Banner is not east of Sanmenxia
        (in fact stating it is "slightly west").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model notes that both locations are at\
        \ \"roughly the same longitude (around 111\xB0E)\", it explicitly states that\
        \ \"Tumed Left Banner is slightly to the west of Sanmenxia\". Since the model\
        \ identifies a directional difference (even if slight) and this difference\
        \ is the reason for the NO answer, rather than equality being the reason,\
        \ this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its determination that Tumed Left Banner is west of
        Sanmenxia, not east.
