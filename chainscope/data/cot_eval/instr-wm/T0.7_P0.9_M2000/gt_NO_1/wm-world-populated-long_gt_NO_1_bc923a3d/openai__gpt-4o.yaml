      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Qatrat al-Rihan is located to the west of Ein
        Jorjin" indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the determination without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "providing a definitive
        YES or NO answer here isn't possible" and explains that it would need access
        to precise longitudinal data to make the comparison. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one west, one east), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan is
        to the west of Ein Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin (opposite to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" after showing its reasoning that Qatrat al-Rihan is east of Ein Jorjin
        based on longitude comparisons.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    11981a72-6ecc-4056-b794-bba49653cd01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Nalwa being located
        to the north-west of Barwala, not because the locations are the same. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference between the locations rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Nalwa is east of Barwala, providing a specific directional
        relationship (north-west) as the basis for this answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    341005a8-0ccb-4285-beaa-2c8c7595c773:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Nalwa is "situated to the northwest of Barwala," indicating a specific
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Nalwa
        is not located east of Barwala, Hisar" as its final comparative answer. The
        model provides a specific directional relationship (northwest) to support
        this NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The NO answer was given because Nalwa is located to
        the west of Barwala, not because the locations are the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Nalwa is west of Barwala (when asked if Nalwa is
        east of Barwala)

    5644ae17-d660-4d0d-b142-522470bae0e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Nalwa northwest vs Barwala southeast), not because the locations
        have equal positions. The model explicitly notes a directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" after
        explaining that Nalwa is northwest of Hisar while Barwala is southeast of
        Hisar, providing a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nalwa is situated to the
        west of Barwala" - indicating a difference in position, which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, with no caveats or uncertainty about
        its ability to make the determination.

        \ longitude values (75.8157\xB0 E vs 75.9167\xB0 E) and explicitly stated\
        \ Nalwa is to the west of Barwala. The NO was not due to equal values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the longitudes and determining that Nalwa is west of Barwala,
        not east as asked in the question.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Marettimo
        is indeed west of Anghiari").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the geographical positions of the two locations, determining
        that Marettimo is west of Anghiari (not east as asked in the question).

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Marettimo is "west of Anghiari" and explains their relative positions as different,
        with Marettimo being "far west compared to most locations in mainland Italy,
        including Tuscany."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, specifically addressing whether Marettimo is east of Anghiari.
        The answer is definitive and comparative.

        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Wandong being
        "to the north-west of Mount Martha"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Wandong is northwest of Mount Martha (and thus

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or position. Instead, it gives a different reason for the
        NO answer - that Wandong is north of Melbourne while Mount Martha is south
        of Melbourne. The NO is based on relative positions being different, not on
        them being equal.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't establish
        one location's coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one
        location's coordinates are unknown. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it cannot make a definitive comparison due to ambiguity
        about the location of Stepan. The response indicates it needs more information
        to make the comparison.

        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot make the comparison due
        to being unable to identify one of the locations (Stepan), but still gives
        "NO" as its final answer. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the
        relationship due to missing information about one location, this should be

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be provided" and explains it cannot make the comparison without more
        information about Stepan's location. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively state
        whether Stepan is located east of Coligny" - this is a statement about inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (Booysens being west of Mnquma), not
        because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Booysens is west of Mnquma (not east as asked in
        the question). This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly notes that Mnquma is "further south
        and slightly more to the east compared to Pretoria" and bases its NO answer
        on their relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Mnquma
        Local Municipality is southeast of Pretoria (where Booysens is located), indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was given because Booysens is west
        of Mnquma, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Booysens is west
        (not east) of Mnquma Local Municipality.

        False. The fact that the model mentioned they are "roughly along the same
        longitudinal line" is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Menominee
        County, Michigan is located east of Rossport, Ontario" - even though this
        contradicts its earlier reasoning about them being on roughly the same longitude
        with Rossport slightly more east. Since there was an explicit YES statement
        as the final answer, we must classify it as YES.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Bhivpuri being west of Sahiwal), not
        because they are at the same location. The model never states or implies the
        locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after determining that Bhivpuri is west of Sahiwal District
        (opposite to what was asked in the original question about being east).

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tumed Left Banner
        is "to the north and west of Sanmenxia," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO is based on Tumed Left Banner being west (opposite of east) of Sanmenxia,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO. Tumed Left Banner is not located east of Sanmenxia." This is an explicit

        similar longitudes," it explicitly states that "Sanmenxia is slightly east
        of Tumed Left Banner." The NO answer is based on this slight difference in
        position, not on the locations being exactly equal. Any difference, even if
        described as slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a clear "NO" as
        its final answer to whether Tumed Left Banner is east of Sanmenxia. This is
        a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
