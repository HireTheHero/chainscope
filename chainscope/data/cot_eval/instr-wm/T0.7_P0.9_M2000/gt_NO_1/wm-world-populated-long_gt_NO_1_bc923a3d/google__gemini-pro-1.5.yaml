    0fdd51ef-a60b-4382-8709-40ba7060ae93:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly noted that Topolobampo is "much further
        east than any part of Wyoming," indicating a clear difference in position
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    258bc3c7-dcad-4b22-b24c-b636dca1e03f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that Topolobampo is "much further
        east than any location in Wyoming." The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Cody is likely
        west of Topolobampo, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing reasoning about the east/west positions of the
        locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    351a9422-d534-4fbe-a25e-c6bae475a5a3:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Topolobampo is "much further
        east than Cody, Wyoming." The NO answer is based on this difference in longitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing geographical reasoning.

    3f240e04-ec1a-405c-af60-09e60c035933:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO after reasoning that Cody would
        be west of Topolobampo (indicating a difference in position), contradicting
        its final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    568a1152-883a-4d9c-963c-2dc0a2b9b80c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Cody is not east of Topolobampo based
        on their relative positions, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    98308c38-1b3a-4732-8deb-a8adf4056574:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were at equal positions - it actually concluded one was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions of Cody, Wyoming and Topolobampo.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ae1a0769-1e5e-4dbc-85a5-d018fc4eed51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "Cody is much further east" than Topolobampo.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after walking through the geographic locations of
        both places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c1fad912-c507-41cf-903e-e6fcf2c3e8ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it reasoned through relative
        positions (western US vs Mexico) to reach its conclusion. The NO appears to
        be based on the relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This was a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eab08bc4-c909-45a0-b67b-3813501962f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it provides reasoning about their relative positions
        and concludes NO based on geographical analysis, indicating Cody is likely
        west of Topolobampo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    037ed44a-2c78-4a06-ab44-c4a67525b419:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan "lies
        to the west of Ein Jorjin", indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. Even though this might be a small difference, any stated directional
        difference means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    196ed0b6-aa25-4f5a-8ec9-9ba9e41b9d8d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined there was a directional
        difference (Qatrat al-Rihan being west of Ein Jorjin). Even though this was
        based on general country locations, the model explicitly stated a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin. This is a clear comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2326b471-f328-4593-b34d-381a7fd8aa0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    27275ade-af5f-44fd-9184-64def688ca6c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Qatrat al-Rihan is "slightly
        west of Ein Jorjin", indicating a difference in position, even if small. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is slightly west of Ein Jorjin.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3bf2647b-11c6-48f2-8662-ef5d724095e4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Qatrat al-Rihan
        is located east of Ein Jorjin" making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    520e4016-714c-41c6-aa7a-e8b500b48094:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying
        out its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a8197fd8-71a7-4709-9e73-573b6158a979:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is\
        \ automatically False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found\
        \ different values (35.2\xB0E vs 35.0\xB0E), not equal ones"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the longitudes of the two locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ba4779e5-9543-4e0c-8a19-523875f815b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan is "slightly west of Ein Jorjin".
        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin (and therefore
        not east of it)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3cd1133-0051-4dac-9fa7-eaa3acf61240:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Qatrat al-Rihan is slightly
        west of Ein Jorjin" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fe248ed3-0a04-40cf-9fe4-ce1606cd2f1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan is
        "slightly west of Ein Jorjin" and uses this directional difference (not equality)
        as the basis for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final standalone answer. This is a clear negative comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a logical relationship
        (one location being inside the other) rather than the locations having equal
        coordinates or values. The model explains that since Sijarinska Banja is inside
        Toplica District, the district cannot be entirely east of it - this indicates
        a spatial relationship, not equality.

        is inside the other (Toplica District), making it impossible for the district
        to be entirely east of the town. This is a spatial relationship difference,
        not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, the reason given was that one location (Sijarinska
        Banja) is inside the other (Toplica District), making an east/west comparison
        impossible because a containing region cannot be entirely east or west of
        something within it.

        logical impossibility of making a directional comparison when one location
        is contained within the other. The model does not state the values are equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        The model explicitly states that Sijarinska Banja is "within" Toplica District,
        and uses this containment relationship as the reason why one cannot be entirely
        east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or identical. Instead, it reasoned that since Sijarinska Banja
        is inside Toplica District, the district cannot be strictly east of it. The
        answer is based on their relative positions (one being inside the other),
        not on them being at the same location or having equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        appears to be given for some other reason (though the reasoning seems inconsistent
        with the conclusion).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal values. Instead, it explicitly states that one location
        is in the western hemisphere while the other is in the eastern hemisphere,
        indicating a difference in position as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Steyning being west of Holton cum Beckering), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a difference in
        location, noting that "Lincolnshire is considerably east of West Sussex."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Steyning is west
        (not east) of Holton cum Beckering.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other (Steyning is west of Holton cum Beckering), indicating a
        difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct comparative result
        based on geographical reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Holton cum Beckering is east of Steyning
        (indicating different positions). The NO is because Steyning is west of Holton
        cum Beckering, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Steyning is east of Holton cum Beckering, after explaining
        that Holton cum Beckering is east of Steyning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that Lincolnshire is "considerably
        east of West Sussex" and concludes that Steyning is west of Holton cum Beckering.
        The NO answer appears to be based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its comparative analysis of the locations' positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicates that there is a directional
        difference, stating that "Steyning is west of Holton cum Beckering" and that
        "Lincolnshire is considerably north and east of West Sussex." The NO answer
        appears to be based on some other reasoning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis of the locations, making this a definitive
        NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Leknes being west
        of Lig (a directional difference), not because the locations have equal longitude.
        The response explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Lofoten
        is further north and west than Vestland").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a clear comparative judgment that Leknes is west of Lig, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Lofoten Islands are "west" than Vestland county), which indicates different
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides directional reasoning (Lofoten being "west" of Vestland)

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Leknes
        is west of Lig, not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states a directional difference ("Leknes is west of Lig")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Leknes is not east of Lig (because it determined Leknes
        is west of Lig)

        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on Dera Ghazi Khan being "likely
        west of" Visavadar due to Pakistan's position relative to India. Since it
        indicated a directional difference (west), even if potentially small, this
        is not a case of equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the relative positions
        being different (with Dera Ghazi Khan being west of Visavadar), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Dera Ghazi Khan is not east of Visavadar.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Beckenham is "south and slightly
        west of Canary Wharf", showing they are at different locations with a directional
        difference. Even though the difference might be small ("slightly west"), any
        stated directional difference means the values are not equal.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a difference in position (Apac
        is "slightly northeast" of Bombo) and gives NO because Apac is not directly
        east, not because the positions are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is

        of Bombo and provides directional reasoning about why it cannot be east (it's
        in northern Uganda while Bombo is in central Uganda). The NO is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Marettimo
        is west of Anghiari, not because the locations are at the same position. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("to the southwest"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Marettimo is west of Anghiari, not east. This is a

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Marettimo cannot be east of Anghiari (because it's west
        of it). This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was because San Benito
        County is explicitly stated to be "considerably west" of Grass Valley, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with supporting reasoning about San Benito County
        being west (not east) of Grass Valley.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Benito County is "significantly
        west" of Grass Valley, indicating a clear difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result stating that San Benito County is
        not east of Grass Valley. The answer is definitive and matches the NO criteria.

    75875030-8ba5-420f-abe1-01852eeba3ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that San Benito County is west of Grass
        Valley, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The
        NO appears to be rejecting a premise that San Benito County is east of Grass
        Valley.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining the geographical relationship between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with San Benito County being west of Grass Valley. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitude. Instead, it noted there "might be a slight eastward or westward
        offset" but argued this offset wasn't significant enough given the north/south
        separation. Since it acknowledged potential differences rather than equality,
        this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and came to a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it gives a directional
        difference, stating that North Yorkshire (where Skipwith is) is "generally
        west of Hampshire" (where Horndean is). Since it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "NO" being the last line and also stating "NOT

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were at equal longitude. Instead, it explained that Skipwith
        is primarily north of Horndean and "not significantly east enough" to be considered
        east of it, indicating there are differences in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Skipwith

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Yuli being west of Fuga Island), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it appears to give the NO answer because its reasoning about Tasmania being
        west of mainland Australia (which would affect the relative positions) is
        incorrect. Since the NO is not based on equality of values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        Tasmania (where Whitemark is) is entirely west of the mainland (where Forbes
        is), making it impossible for Whitemark to be east of Forbes. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        or the same. In fact, it notes differences in their locations (Tasmania vs
        mainland, and Tasmania being "significantly west" of New South Wales). The
        NO answer appears to be based on these differences rather than any equality.

        reasoning about Tasmania's position relative to mainland Australia. The model
        states there is a directional difference (even though its geographic reasoning
        is factually wrong), not that the locations are at equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated a difference in position (stating
        Shropshire is generally west of Monmouthshire). The NO answer appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated,
        not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it works through
        the logic of relative positions and arrives at NO as its answer. The model
        actually notes that Shropshire is generally west of Monmouthshire, but still
        concludes NO, suggesting some other reason for the negative answer rather
        than equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Colo
        is west of Collins (indicating different positions), not because they are
        at the same location. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Colo is west of Collins (meaning Collins
        is further east than Colo).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6303aea3-69df-4d50-ada2-38127e7d22ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Colo is west of
        Collins, not because the locations are equal/identical. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Colo, Iowa is west of Collins, Iowa").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the towns.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    665af2df-379c-4ace-b39e-191a86efbeb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Colo is slightly
        west of Collins," indicating there is a directional difference between the
        locations, even if small. Since any stated difference, even if described as
        "slight," means the locations are not exactly the same, this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the locations, making this a definitive NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in longitude values (-93.3093 vs -92.1047) and concludes
        that Colo is west of Collins. The NO is not based on equal values, but rather
        on finding a specific directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the longitudes of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are equal
        or the same in any way. Instead, it explicitly states that "Colo is west of
        Collins," indicating a difference in position. This directional difference,
        not equality, is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. The answer
        is clear and direct.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the cities are in the
        same location or have equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Colo is west of Collins, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question of whether Colo is east of Collins,
        after explaining its reasoning process.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its determination
        that Riondel is west of Crest (due to British Columbia being west of California),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. The model indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Crest is east of Riondel. This is a clear, direct NO response
        based on its geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that British Columbia
        is west of California and concludes that "a location in California cannot
        be east of a location in British Columbia." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a definitive comparative judgment based on geographical
        reasoning about the relative positions of California and British Columbia.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it made a directional comparison, stating that
        "California is west of British Columbia" and concluding that "Crest is west
        of Riondel" before giving its NO answer. The model did not cite equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a significant difference,
        noting that "Southern California is significantly west of the British Columbia/Idaho/Washington
        area" and concludes that "Crest is west of Riondel." The NO answer is not
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after working through the geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly describes differences in their positions,
        stating that Riondel is "significantly further north" and that Crest is "west
        of Riondel". The NO answer appears to be based on these directional differences,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the locations and relative
        positions.

        before giving its NO answer. The model appears to be contradicting its own
        reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical
        consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

        is significantly west of southeastern British Columbia" and concluded that
        "Crest, California is west of Riondel, British Columbia". The NO answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated about equality (which was nothing).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Muddenahalli is west of Sikandrabad). The NO appears to be in
        response to whether one location is east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it described a directional difference, noting that Karnataka
        locations are generally west of Uttar Pradesh locations. Even though this
        was a general statement, any stated directional difference means we cannot
        classify this as equality-based.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because one
        location was determined to be south of the other, rather than east. The model
        identified a specific directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sans Souci is
        further east than Berowra Heights, indicating a clear difference in their
        east/west positions. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative conclusion that "Berowra Heights is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Ammassalik
        Island is east of Aracati (indicating different longitudes), not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference ("Greenland is much further east than Brazil").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Aracati is east of Ammassalik Island, providing a direct comparative
        result based on its analysis of their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Greenland is much further east
        than Brazil" and concluded that "Ammassalik Island is east of Aracati." The
        NO answer was based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Aracati is not east of Ammassalik
        Island. This was a direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("Aracati is west of Ammassalik Island") and notes that "Greenland is
        much further east than Brazil". The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Branchville
        is "considerably west of Vincentown" - it explicitly states a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Branchville is west of Vincentown and therefore cannot
        be east of it. This is a direct comparative answer.

        County, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison being
        evaluated (whether Menominee County is east of Rossport)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Rossport is west of Menominee
        County. The NO answer is given because Menominee County cannot be east of
        Rossport (since Rossport is west of it), not because the locations are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the geographical positions of the two locations. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "YES" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitude or exactly the same position. Instead, it reasoned about relative
        positions and concluded NO based on geographical analysis of their likely
        positions, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without indicating uncertainty
        about making the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explains that while Colorado extends further
        east than parts of Mexico, the primary difference is North/South, and concludes
        NO based on this reasoning. The response implies there are differences in
        position, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude. Instead, it indicated that Michigan is west of Indiana,
        and specifically that Big Rapids (in western Michigan) and Rush County (in
        eastern Indiana) have different longitudinal positions. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being at equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that Michigan is
        west of Indiana and therefore Big Rapids is west of Rush County - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        step-by-step reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model makes
        a clear comparative judgment that Big Rapids is west of Rush County, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in longitude. Instead, it described relative positions (western
        Michigan vs eastern-central Indiana) and concluded with NO for unstated reasons.
        The reasoning actually suggested a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

        appears to be rejecting that Little Skellig is east of Montserrado County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        reason - that Little Skellig is west of the Prime Meridian while Montserrado
        is east of it, making it impossible for Little Skellig to be east of Montserrado.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because Little
        Skellig is in the western hemisphere while Montserrado County is in the eastern
        hemisphere, indicating a difference in position. The NO was based on their
        different hemispheric locations, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (western vs eastern) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on the logical impossibility of something being both east
        and west of another location, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Little Skellig is west of Montserrado County (due to
        hemisphere differences), indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Little Skellig is not east
        of Montserrado County (and explains it is west instead).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the locations (one being west of the prime meridian and one being east),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in their positions relative to the prime meridian.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing logical reasoning about hemispheric positions
        to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (one being west of the Prime Meridian and the
        other being east of it) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning about the relative
        positions of the two locations with respect to the Prime Meridian.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it explains that while Thondamuthur
        might be slightly east relative to some western points, it's not east of the
        entire district, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Thondamuthur is not east of Kalaburagi
        district.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("slightly east of the direct north-south line"), which means even though
        the difference might be small, they are not equal. Any stated difference,
        even if described as "slight," means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

    d8ba4727-e1a9-4578-b59b-4fff79862644:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values/positions,
        but rather on the fact that Hougang's position relative to the North Region
        is mixed - being east of some parts but not others. The model explicitly states
        there are different relative positions ("east of *part*" but "not east of
        the *entire*"), so this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Hougang
        is not entirely east of the North Region.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f26bb4f5-949c-4d13-b442-300e69db1f3c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that since Hougang is in the
        North-East Region and therefore "partially north," it cannot be entirely east
        of the North Region. The reasoning is about relative positioning, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the spatial relationship
        between Hougang and the North Region.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Tumed Left Banner being west of Sanmenxia), not on the locations being equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about relative positions
        leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Tumed Left Banner is "significantly west
        of Sanmenxia". The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it actually indicated there was a directional difference,
        stating that Tumed Left Banner is "likely west of Sanmenxia" before giving
        its NO answer (though this seems contradictory, we must take the explicit
        NO at face value without trying to resolve the contradiction).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis.

        - it actually specified that Tumed Left Banner is "slightly east" of Sanmenxia's
        central longitude, indicating a difference in position rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Tumed
        Left Banner is not west of Sanmenxia (in fact stating it is "slightly east")
