      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which weren't mentioned anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Cody, Wyoming
        is located east of Topolobampo" as its final comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model discusses very similar longitudes,\
        \ it ultimately concludes that there is a specific difference (Cody at 109.06\xB0\
        W and Topolobampo at 109.05\xB0W) and bases its NO answer on Topolobampo being\
        \ east of Cody due to this difference. The values are not equal, and the NO\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The presence of equal/different
        values in the response is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: Although the model initially answered NO, it then
        corrected itself and explicitly concluded with "YES. Cody, Wyoming is located
        east of Topolobampo." This final YES answer is clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Topolobampo is "further west
        in longitude" than Cody, Wyoming. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of Cody, Wyoming
        and Topolobampo.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, while the model
        noted the locations were "around the same longitude," it specifically identified
        a difference, stating "Cody is slightly east of Topolobampo."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Cody, Wyoming
        is located east of Topolobampo." This is a clear, direct YES answer to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Qatrat al-Rihan being west of Ein Jorjin, not east), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that Qatrat al-Rihan is NOT located east of Ein Jorjin,
        but rather to its west. This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7472b97d-9740-4404-8667-6ef8b75e1695:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal or the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference with Qatrat
        al-Rihan being west of Ein Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that "Qatrat al-Rihan is NOT east of Ein Jorjin, but
        rather west of it." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      result: 'NO'
    7c4bae81-e3f6-4979-8450-ff94bec7abb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Qatrat al-Rihan was explicitly stated to be "to the west of Ein Jorjin" -
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin and therefore
        cannot be east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8e9e8e31-34d4-4aff-aab7-21a80bb4e977:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        locations were equal - it actually stated one was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        changed its answer to YES at the end after reconfirming its reasoning. The
        final definitive answer was YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9f285056-71ad-46dc-af88-7af302ae89c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin and therefore
        cannot be east of it.

    a31fd001-cde9-40f5-85d7-cdb2a2fd6248:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Qatrat
        al-Rihan is to the west of Ein Jorjin, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was given because Qatrat al-Rihan is west, not east, of Ein
        Jorjin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west (not east) of Ein Jorjin. This
        is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ab556620-150d-4e61-b52c-8cd5d5ff7f07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical in position. Instead, it indicated there was a difference in
        their positions, with Qatrat al-Rihan being southeast of Ein Jorjin. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    bfc33840-a738-423f-9288-3f4433c4c1f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Qatrat al-Rihan being west of Ein Jorjin), not because the locations
        are at the same position. Even if the difference might be small (which isn't
        specified), any stated directional difference means this isn't an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

    c7107323-bc18-4ad5-806f-570854136431:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both villages are in the
        same region of Lebanon, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Qatrat al-Rihan is located to the west of Ein Jorjin"). The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Qatrat al-Rihan is west of Ein Jorjin.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    da765745-ae8b-4298-8290-472c093bbdfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Qatrat al-Rihan being to the west of Ein Jorjin. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that Qatrat al-Rihan is
        NOT located east of Ein Jorjin, but rather to its west.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that Nalwa is
        "to the west of Barwala," indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions and concluding that Nalwa
        is west of Barwala (not east)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1e54b8f7-7d29-4599-ad76-0222ce45d00a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Nalwa
        is west of Barwala (indicating different positions), which is why it's not
        east of Barwala.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Nalwa is NOT located east of Barwala, Hisar." This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gave a NO answer because it found different\
        \ longitude values (75.83\xB0E vs 75.91\xB0E) and explicitly stated that Nalwa\
        \ is west of Barwala. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because\
        \ one location was found to be west of the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and provides a clear comparative analysis showing that Nalwa is west (not
        east) of Barwala based on their longitudes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ is west of Barwala. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Nalwa is not located
        east of Barwala, Hisar" and provides a definitive comparative result, explaining
        that Nalwa is west of Barwala based on longitude calculations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a41f11cb-2186-46de-be6b-b57de100f047:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Nalwa being west
        of Barwala, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Nalwa is located to
        the west of Barwala")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    cedc94e8-80fb-4955-9f3f-a37333b4bea3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since the response did not end with NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating this was based on
        Nalwa being in the eastern part while Barwala is in the western part.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Nalwa is west of Barwala, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO is because Nalwa is in the opposite direction
        (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that "Nalwa is NOT east of Barwala, but rather west
        of it." This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        other, with Steyning being west of Holton cum Beckering. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result after analyzing the east-west
        positions of both locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a directional difference, concluding that "Dera Ghazi Khan must
        be west of Visavadar, not east." The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Dera Ghazi Khan is not east
        of Visavadar.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states\
        \ there is a difference in longitude values (70\xB0E vs 71\xB0E) and uses\
        \ this difference to conclude that one location is west of the other. The\
        \ NO is not based on equal values, but rather on a clear directional difference."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Dera Ghazi Khan is not
        located east of Visavadar" as its final answer, providing a direct NO to the
        comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (Dera Ghazi
        Khan is west of Visavadar).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Dera Ghazi Khan is west (not east) of Visavadar.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    c2e81781-d84e-4fa5-a8bb-d398f0bb4e21:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Dera Ghazi Khan is to the west/northwest of Visavadar, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Dera Ghazi Khan is east of Visavadar, after determining
        that Dera Ghazi Khan is to the west/northwest of Visavadar.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        one location is west of the other, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states "Dera Ghazi Khan must be west of Visavadar."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after determining that Dera Ghazi Khan is west of Visavadar (not east
        as presumably asked in the original question)

    de4eaaed-af2f-4097-9d27-bfb169202a6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Dera Ghazi Khan being west of Visavadar), not on the locations
        being equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Dera Ghazi Khan is not
        located east of Visavadar. It is located west of Visavadar." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Canary
        Wharf is "to the east of Beckenham" and that Beckenham is "further south and
        slightly west of Canary Wharf". The NO answer was based on these positional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same in position. Instead, it explicitly stated a difference, saying
        "Beckenham is further east than Canary Wharf." The NO answer was based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the locations, indicating that Canary Wharf is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (Apac is west of Bombo), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "Apac is NOT located east of Bombo, but rather west of it." This is
        a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Apac is to the west of Bombo
        and describes them as being in different regions (northwestern vs central).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Apac is located to the west of Bombo, making a clear comparative statement
        about their relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Bombo is "possibly slightly
        further east" and that Apac is "either directly north or slightly west of
        Bombo." Even though the longitudes are described as "very similar," the model
        indicates a slight difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Apac is to the northwest of Bombo) and uses this difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

        is west of Bombo, not because they are at the same longitude. The model explicitly
        states "Apac is actually west of Bombo, not east," indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, determining that Apac is west
        of Bombo (not east as asked in the question).

        Peper Harow is to the west of Great Gonerby, indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because Peper Harow is west of, not
        east of, Great Gonerby.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Peper Harow is NOT east of Great

        equal - it actually stated that Peper Harow is "generally west of Great Gonerby"
        and that "Great Gonerby is located in a more easterly position." Since it
        identified a directional difference (even if slight), this cannot be classified
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, determining

    cc46da78-389b-4b57-87f8-7ccb4963b4cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in
        their positions, with Great Gonerby being "further east than Peper Harow"
        and Peper Harow being "west of Great Gonerby".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Peper Harow is west of Great Gonerby, not east.

      result: 'NO'
    da7dfb8c-3745-48cc-9a65-722420df5f85:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Peper Harow is
        "to the west of Great Gonerby" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality. The NO was given because Peper Harow is west rather than east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Peper Harow is west (not
        east) of Great Gonerby.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states East Garo Hills
        is southwest of Goalpara, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides directional reasoning that East Garo Hills is southwest of Goalpara,
        not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    15336b6f-bb1e-4119-bf95-bc63ba0aa978:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, with East Garo Hills being to the west of Goalpara.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after correcting
        its initial analysis, stating that East Garo Hills is positioned to the west
        of Goalpara, not to the east. This is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that East
        Garo Hills is southwest of Goalpara, indicating a directional difference.
        The model does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way
        - it specifically identifies a positional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two districts, determining
        that East Garo Hills is southwest of Goalpara, not east of it.

        or the same - it actually specifies that East Garo Hills is "to the west and
        south" of Goalpara, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states that East Garo Hills is not located east of Goalpara, instead being
        "to the west and south of it".

    a6e8348f-3b8c-4ead-af05-df8d728c2aee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical - it explicitly states that East Garo
        Hills is "west and slightly south of Goalpara district". The NO is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, East
        Garo Hills district is not located east of Goalpara" and provides a definitive
        comparative result that it is west of Goalpara instead.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cc412f4b-51c2-4932-929d-3cb685989d8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying East Garo Hills is "to the west/southwest
        of Goalpara district." Any directional difference, even if slight, means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "East Garo Hills district is NOT located east of Goalpara, but rather
        to its west." This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ecd08c9c-91b5-4046-a4ae-04ca1623c5f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position. Instead, it specifically indicates that East Garo Hills
        is "to the southwest" of Goalpara, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "East Garo Hills district is NOT located east of Goalpara." This is
        a direct comparative answer to the position question.

    f1dc50ac-57ea-462d-b653-70ec24f53fcf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (East Garo Hills being west/southwest of Goalpara), not because
        the locations are at the same position. Even though the difference might be
        small, any stated directional difference means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that East Garo Hills is west of Goalpara, not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (East Garo Hills being "south and slightly west of Goalpara"),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes
        a directional difference, even though it's described as "slightly" west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that East Garo Hills is
        west of Goalpara (not east of it).

      explanation_equal_values: "The model explicitly states that Belovo is \"slightly\
        \ east of Mati\" (at 24.5\xB0E vs 24\xB0E), indicating a difference in position\
        \ rather than equality. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on\
        \ the locations being at the same longitude."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Belovo is slightly east of Mati (not the other way around). This is a
        direct comparative answer to whether Mati is east of Belovo.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are "at similar longitudes,"
        it also states "or Mati is slightly west of Belovo." Since it presents the
        possibility of a directional difference (even if slight), this is not a pure
        equality-based NO answer. The model gives two alternative explanations - either
        equality OR a slight westward difference - rather than basing its NO solely
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Mati, Greece is
        not located east of Belovo, Bulgaria" as its final comparative answer. This
        is a clear NO response to whether Mati is east of Belovo.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs east).
        The NO is because the actual direction (southeast) differs from the pure east
        direction being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"NO\" as its final comparative\

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        San Benito County was determined to be west of Grass Valley (indicating a
        difference in location), which contradicted some premise in the original question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states San Benito County is west
        of Grass Valley, indicating different positions. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, San Benito

        that "Skipwith might be slightly east of Horndean" and "may be very slightly
        to the east." Since it indicates a directional difference, even if slight,
        this is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, and while it expresses some uncertainty about the exact positions,
        it provides this as a direct answer to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually described them as being in different
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations, which appears to be a direct answer to whether Skipwith is
        east of Horndean. However, this NO seems to contradict the model's own analysis
        which states "Skipwith would be positioned more to the east than Horndean."
        Due to this internal contradiction, we must classify this as UNKNOWN since
        there is no clear, consistent YES/NO answer.

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated there
        was a difference, saying "Skipwith is further east in terms of longitude compared
        to Horndean." The NO answer appears to contradict this analysis, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency. Since the model
        described a difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations, and this appears to be a direct comparative answer (though
        it seems to contradict its own analysis which stated Skipwith is further east).
        The answer is clearly stated as "NO" without any caveats about uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but explicitly stated there
        is a difference in position ("slightly to the west compared to Pyinmana").
        The NO wasn't based on the locations being equal/same/identical, but rather
        because one location was slightly west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        difference as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is
        described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explicitly states "Thingangyun Township is NOT east of Pyinmana." This

        same longitude," it immediately qualifies this by stating "with Mason possibly
        slightly to the west." Since it indicates there is a slight directional difference
        (even if tiny), this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal as
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Mason, Wisconsin
        is not located east of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana" as its final comparative
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are exactly
        equal in longitude. Instead, it states they are "roughly similar" but explicitly
        notes that "Mason is likely slightly west of East Baton Rouge Parish" - indicating
        a difference, even if small. Since it identifies a directional difference,
        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis, providing a clear comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated a difference, concluding that "Mason,
        WI is further west than East Baton Rouge Parish, LA". The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions. The answer was
        clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        saying "Mason's position in northwestern Wisconsin places it further west
        than East Baton Rouge Parish's position in southeastern Louisiana". The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations and determining
        that Mason, WI is further west than East Baton Rouge Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly states that "Coxheath is located
        further east than Crowhurst." The NO answer was based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that

    36d4b07d-3b5a-425f-8130-ea65eccdc645:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northeast rather than purely east). Even though there is "an easterly
        component," the model identifies a distinct directional difference as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. While
        it notes there is an easterly component, it determines that northeast is more
        accurate than purely east.

    4090e2b3-0476-4392-979b-d3fcdd683fdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Coxheath
        is "northeast" rather than "directly east" of Crowhurst. This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality. The model explicitly states there is
        a northward component to the relative position, making them not exactly east
        of each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    cbbb196a-bb20-47e1-9caf-57c0ea67166f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northeast vs. east), not because the locations are in the same place. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Coxheath being
        northeast of Crowhurst rather than due east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and then reaffirms
        this answer by explaining that Coxheath is "northeast of" rather than "east
        of" Crowhurst. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (northeast vs east). The NO is because the direction is different
        from what was asked about, not because the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Coxheath is northeast rather than directly
        east of Crowhurst. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

        northeast) of Crowhurst" - indicating a difference in position, even if slight.
        The NO answer appears to contradict the analysis given, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is clear and direct,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Mad
        River, CA is west and south of Lookingglass, OR - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model never states that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, directly addressing the comparative question by determining that Mad
        River, CA is west and south of Lookingglass, OR, not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yuli is west of
        Fuga Island, indicating a difference in position. The model provides specific
        longitude ranges and clearly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Yuli, Hualien is not
        located east of Fuga Island. It is located west of Fuga Island." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        positions, its final NO answer was based on Yuli being "slightly west of Fuga
        Island" - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The model did
        not state the locations were at the same longitude as its reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through multiple revisions but ended
        with a clear final "NO" answer, stating "Yuli, Hualien is not located east
        of Fuga Island. It's slightly west of Fuga Island."

        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining

        and concludes that Yuli is WEST of Fuga Island. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that "Whitemark on Flinders Island is further
        east than Forbes." The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        is irrelevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO, but then revised
        its answer to explicitly state YES at the end of its response. We should take
        the final stated answer, which was YES.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are "essentially
        the same" and the difference is "extremely small," it still explicitly states
        there is a difference ("Whitemark being negligibly east of Forbes"). Even
        though this difference is described as minimal and possibly within margin
        of error, the mere mention of any directional difference means this isn't
        a pure equality case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a rejection
        of the premise or inability to determine.

        NO answer, while also noting Varallo Sesia is "possibly slightly east of Bebeji
        but not significantly so". Since it mentions even a slight difference in position,
        this doesn't qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Varallo Sesia
        is not located east of Bebeji" as its comparative answer, even though it notes
        they are approximately aligned.

        ("Varallo Sesia is slightly to the west of Bebeji"). Any stated difference,
        even if described as slight, means this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis that Varallo
        Sesia is slightly to the west of Bebeji, not to the east.

        in position, even if slight. The presence of any stated difference, even if
        described as slight, means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Wandong is
        not east of Mount Martha", providing a clear negative comparative answer.
        While there is some inconsistency in the reasoning (Step 5 vs final statement),

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions, with Booysens being west of Mnquma.
        The model does not state or suggest the locations are at equal positions -
        rather, it explicitly states there is a directional difference. Therefore,
        the NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Booysens is west of Mnquma, not east of it. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Mnquma is "further
        east than Booysens" and bases its NO answer on this difference in position,
        not on the locations being at the same longitude. Since it identifies a directional
        difference, even if factually incorrect, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that
        Booysens cannot be east of Mnquma.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its comparative
        answer, stating "NO. Booysens, Pretoria is not located east of Mnquma Local
        Municipality." While there is some confusion in the explanation (saying it's
        "slightly to the east" while concluding it's not east), the model gives a
        clear NO answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        in position, saying "Llangyfelach is actually to the west of Llanddewi Brefi."
        The NO appears to be in response to a question about whether Llangyfelach
        is east of Llanddewi Brefi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer twice, with the
        second NO being its final position after reconsidering. The model is making

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("It is located west of it") and explains the reasoning about how
        the coast angles eastward. The model indicates a clear difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Crest, California
        is not located east of Riondel, British Columbia" and provides a clear comparative

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        were equal is not relevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered NO but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating "Therefore, Thondamuthur

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference, saying that Burslem is west of Levenshulme
        (approximately 35-40 miles southwest).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Burslem is not east of Levenshulme (in
        fact stating it is west).

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        that Burslem is southwest of Levenshulme and therefore west (not east) of
        it, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Burslem is not east of Levenshulme
        (because it determined Burslem is west of Levenshulme).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference - that Burslem is west of Levenshulme. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Burslem
        is not located east of Levenshulme" and provides a definitive comparative
        result, explaining that "Burslem is actually west of Levenshulme."

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Burslem
        is to the west of Levenshulme, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Burslem is west of Levenshulme (not east). This is
        a direct comparative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        Burslem is east of Levenshulme.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Burslem being
        west of Levenshulme. The NO is because the premise (Burslem being east) is
        incorrect, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on geographical
        positions.

        west of Sanmenxia"
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    980d63b5-8c58-4dfb-b74e-72022fc78e31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly stated that Tumed Left Banner is located to
        the northwest of Sanmenxia, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final answer, indicating that Tumed Left Banner is not east of Sanmenxia
        (in fact stating it's to the northwest)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a6c906c1-8bc1-403e-a827-07010d5ba2ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Tumed Left Banner is "further west" and "northwest" of Sanmenxia),
        not because the locations have equal positions. The model explicitly indicates
        there is a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tumed Left Banner is
        not located east of Sanmenxia" and provides a definitive comparative result,
        indicating that Tumed Left Banner is northwest of Sanmenxia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc597fcb-bb14-454d-91a0-e422eb9e68d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "quite close" and "approximately
        at the same longitude," it explicitly states that Sanmenxia is "slightly to
        the east of Tumed Left Banner" and Tumed Left Banner is "slightly to the west."
        Since the model indicates there is a directional difference, even if small,
        this is not a case where equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that "Tumed Left Banner is NOT east of Sanmenxia." This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cd442fa6-d624-442f-893e-cf27cca06865:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model provides specific longitudes (111\xB0\
        E vs 111.2\xB0E) that are close, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ (\"slightly to the west\") and uses this directional difference as the reason\
        \ for its NO answer, not their equality. Any stated difference, even if described\
        \ as slight, means this should be classified as False."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing the comparative question about whether Tumed Left
        Banner is east of Sanmenxia. The answer is definitive and includes directional
        clarification ("actually located slightly to the west").
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e22bcca3-fa11-475c-bb94-6ef6c56cc5f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        a directional difference (Tumed Left Banner is "to the west compared to Sanmenxia"),
        not because the locations are at the same longitude. Any directional difference,
        even if slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that Tumed Left Banner is west of Sanmenxia.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
