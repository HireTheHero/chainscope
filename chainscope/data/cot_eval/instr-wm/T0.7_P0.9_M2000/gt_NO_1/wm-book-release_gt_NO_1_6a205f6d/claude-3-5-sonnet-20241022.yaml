      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, The Truth
        About the Harry Quebert Affair (English version) was released later than Amber
        House."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair
        was released later than Amber House.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values check only applies when
        the final answer is NO
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the publication dates and determining that Dicker's book (2014 English release)
        came later than Amber House (2012)
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    588ba58f-a2f8-4ebe-8e50-e54bf9569e8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the publication dates of both books
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5af7b861-ef0f-441e-a457-9d6df41cffb6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values (release dates)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are different, with Harry Quebert
        being released in September 2012 and Amber House in October 2012. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Harry Quebert Affair was released before Amber
        House
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    880faaf8-cbab-4500-a790-9db8961bc18c:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8b6de35f-4ce7-4e1b-a070-7a77e39627b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were released in the
        same year (2012), it actually states that the English version came later (2014)
        and bases its NO answer on this difference in timing, not on them being equal.
        The model explicitly notes a difference in release dates between the books.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, The Truth
        About the Harry Quebert Affair was NOT released later than Amber House" which
        is a clear NO answer to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aeb188fd-5f7c-4a04-9fbd-04e4d8ed6c3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that Harry Quebert was released later than
        Amber House
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    dab662cb-5151-4334-b71f-116dbe60f0ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Although both books were published in 2012, the model
        explicitly states a difference in timing (September vs October), making this
        a directional comparison rather than an equality comparison. The NO is based
        on Amber House being "later," not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, indicating that Amber House was released later in the
        same year.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f020d375-f1dc-45f8-a1d4-9d94252cc2d9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Harry Quebert came out "earlier in 2012"
        compared to Amber House's October 2012 release. This temporal difference,
        even though within the same year, means the NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates of both books.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    25543ac5-e5d9-42bf-aa65-35aa389ee76a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after its step-by-step analysis'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5e07f074-1b20-4c38-b022-0873cc5c486d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (October vs
        November 1978)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the publication dates and determining that Beauty was released later than
        Fools Die
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5fb767d7-8718-4e9c-87a1-86de19b3499f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found the books were published
        in different months (October vs June 1978)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the publication dates and determining that "Fools Die"
        was released later than "Beauty"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    698df5f8-b5bb-4684-bf8d-7c690c315aa3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step reasoning
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a4b029e1-f35b-486f-83b0-839a4e21130b:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states both books were published
        in the same year (1978) and directly uses this equality as the reason for
        its NO answer, stating "Since both books were published in the same year,
        neither was released 'later' than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as its final comparative answer'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    a5d0cb9f-8c6d-4a86-a395-37b890b379b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 1978, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in timing (October vs November) and
        concludes "NO" because one was "slightly earlier" than the other. The NO answer
        is not due to the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that Puzo's book was released earlier,
        not later, than McKinley's book.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cad7276d-73ab-40eb-8027-5ceb2b8bc45d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, while
        the model notes both books were published in the same month, this wasn't given
        as the reason for the answer - rather, the inability to determine order was
        the stated reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" in its answer, it explicitly
        indicates this is due to inability to determine the order ("cannot confirm")
        rather than a definitive comparison. This makes it a case of being unable
        to verify/determine, which should be classified as UNKNOWN per the criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d038f2b9-67c2-4f2f-adce-38cc085f1bdd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states there is a difference of one month between publication
        dates, with "Fools Die" being released in October and "Beauty" in November
        1978.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Puzo's book was released one month earlier
        than McKinley's book.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e6d6d2d9-fc2d-4dce-8275-9cddf3c3572b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found the books were published
        in different months (September vs October)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after comparing the publication dates and determining that "Fools Die"
        was released later than "Beauty"

      result: 'YES'
    fbf4348b-6b8e-459d-ab79-33ca17b62416:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 1978, the model
        specifically identified different months (October vs November) and used this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on finding that one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Fools Die
        was not released later than Beauty)" after determining Fools Die was released
        in October 1978 and Beauty in November 1978. This is a clear NO answer to
        a comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually found different
        release months (September vs February), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that "Insomnia" was released later than
        "Simisola"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    1b9cd30e-185c-41b9-b4d7-a919d2d526af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1994 comes before
        1995, showing a clear difference in values and using this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Insomnia was not released later
        than Simisola (it was released before)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        dates were different (1994 vs 1995), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Insomnia was released
        before Simisola, not later.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (February
        vs September 1994).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after walking through its reasoning steps comparing publication
        dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - it explicitly states that The Austere Academy was released in August
        while Dreamland was released in September, showing different values. The NO
        is because one came before the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that The Austere Academy was not released later than Dreamland, providing
        a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both books were published in
        the exact same year (2006) and month (March), and this equality is the basis
        for why it cannot determine if one was released later than the other, leading
        to its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between the publication
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it explains that it cannot determine the exact order due to
        same month/year, it still provides a clear "NO" rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

        answer as NO, the model notes equal values but presents this as insufficient
        information rather than as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but explains this is due to insufficient information to prove the comparison
        ("cannot definitively determine"). This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates (2009 for Zhao's book
        vs. 2010 for Murakami's complete work) and gave NO based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        publication dates, making a clear comparative determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Zhao's book was "actually
        published slightly earlier" than Murakami's complete work. Since it indicates
        a difference in timing (not equality), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, providing a definitive comparative answer that Zhao Ziyang's
        book was not released later than Murakami's 1Q84.

    cf3d8e1f-6597-42f6-9a11-2ff2d56cf69d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different dates (2009 vs 2010) and based its NO
        answer on finding that Zhao's book came first
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        publication dates, indicating that Murakami's book did not come before Zhao's
        book (which would make the comparison false)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d2d3bca4-925c-49eb-adc3-8c99a2439022:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they were released "around
        the same time" for the first volume, it explicitly notes a difference in timing
        (Zhao's complete work came out in May 2009 while Murakami's continued through
        2010). The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on them being
        exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Zhao's book was not released later than
        1Q84.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d3ee9eef-6d19-40b8-ba88-5c5ad7124b54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in timing (Zhao's book in May 2009 vs. 1Q84 completed in 2010), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Zhao Ziyang's book was published before the complete publication of 1Q84.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f36540b8-7d2b-437b-af43-a4499ebcf5b3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different dates (Zhao's book in 2009
        vs. Murakami's complete work in 2010) and gave NO based on this difference,
        indicating Zhao's book came out before Murakami's was completed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the publication dates of both books.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the same month (June 2012), and this equality was the primary reason given
        for the NO answer. The model determined they were released at the same time
        and used this as the basis for concluding that one was not later than the
        other.

        dates).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives two contradictory answers - first
        "NO" and then "YES" at the end. However, since the final explicit answer was
        "YES", this should be classified as YES according to the instructions to analyze
        what was explicitly stated, even if illogical.

        Under Ground was released after Smart Girls Get What They Want, and since
        the question asked if it was released later, this indicates a YES answer.

        (same year and month), this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't classified
        as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot definitively determine" the order,
        not as a comparative result. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot determine"
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the model did note both books were published in 2003, this wasn't used to
        give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and needs more specific publication date details to make
        the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        notes both books were published in 2003, this equality was not used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must decline to give
        a YES/NO answer" and indicates it "cannot make a determination" due to insufficient

      explanation_equal_values: While both books were published in 2003, the model
        explicitly states they were published in different months (April vs May) and
        uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on Jenkins's
        book being published before Burgess's book, not because they were published
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Jenkins's book came out before Burgess's book (April

        that both books were released at exactly the same time (April 2003), explicitly
        stating "Both books were released in the same month of the same year" as the
        reason why neither was released "later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        for its NO answer ("Since both books were published in the same year (2003),
        one was not released 'later than' the other").

    cddeae3d-375a-4041-a968-2236b676663c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies that both books were published
        in April 2003, and this equality in publication timing appears to be the primary
        reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't note any differences between the
        dates, only that they are the same (both in April 2003), and uses this sameness
        as the basis for concluding there's no evidence one came later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot determine"
        statement). While the model expresses uncertainty about exact dates, it provides
        NO as its definitive answer to the comparison question.
