      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (Lake Albert is to the west while Lake George is to the east) and uses this
        directional difference to reach its NO conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" and frames it as a clear comparative result (Lake Albert would be
        south of Lake George, not north)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at the
        same location or have equal coordinates. Instead, it indicates they are in
        different positions (one more central, one southeastern) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" as its conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the lakes.'

    82678abd-d064-4b48-aacc-7c453133ce1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, indicating
        that Lake Albert is in a region that is "generally to the west" of Lake George's
        region. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        in a definitive way, making this a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    99d58c13-ec13-4a3b-a8e5-0b9401db0b8b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs. north), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with Lake Albert being "northwest
        of Lake George" rather than directly north
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" and provides this as a comparative result based on the directional analysis
        (indicating Lake Albert is northwest rather than directly north of Lake George)'

    b67c5342-34d1-48dc-8fe9-2d72befd26c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never discussed equal values - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION"
        and explicitly states it cannot provide a clear answer due to limited information.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1142048-7d30-4c4c-9a2a-f0bc03504059:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Lake Albert is "to
        the west and slightly south of Lake George" - this indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a clear comparative result, indicating Lake Albert is not north
        of Lake George.'

    18219019-ca66-4b67-8811-33dad56f3ba4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Reindeer Lake is "more to the east" of the Muskwa Ranges, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive conclusion that "Reindeer Lake is not located north of the
        Muskwa Ranges." The answer is presented as a comparative result, not as an
        inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same latitude or position. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a
        difference in their positions, stating that Reindeer Lake would be south of
        the Muskwa Ranges. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO" and provides this as a clear comparative result, indicating that Reindeer
        Lake is not north of the Muskwa Ranges.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (Reindeer Lake being east of Muskwa Ranges, not north), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final
        answer is: NO" after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Reindeer
        Lake is east of the Muskwa Ranges, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a comparative result explaining that Reindeer Lake is east of
        the Muskwa Ranges, not north.'

    8b015cd0-ed6c-45ae-aa97-61b2263f1dde:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at equal
        latitudes. Instead, it explicitly states that "the Muskwa Ranges are at a
        higher latitude than Reindeer Lake" and that Reindeer Lake is "slightly south"
        of the Muskwa Ranges. The NO answer is based on this difference in latitude,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides a definitive comparative result, indicating that Reindeer Lake
        is not north of the Muskwa Ranges.'

    98eb7dd6-6179-44f8-8b98-dda30de79f50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        with the Muskwa Ranges being "further north" than Reindeer Lake. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or verify.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, indicating
        that Reindeer Lake is "more to the east and at a lower latitude compared to
        the Muskwa Ranges." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the Muskwa
        Ranges being to the northwest of Reindeer Lake. The NO is because one is northwest
        of the other, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on geographic positions, not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or have the same northward position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for the NO answer - that Reindeer Lake is east of the Muskwa Ranges
        rather than north of them. Since the NO answer is not based on equal values,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with Reindeer Lake being "more central or eastward" compared to the Muskwa
        Ranges which are "in the western part." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

        vs Guatemala/Central America). The reason for the NO answer was based on their
        different positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it as a definitive comparative conclusion based on
        geographic analysis. The answer is formatted as "$\boxed{NO}$" and is supported
        by step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a directional difference (northwest rather than
        north). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, making
        this a case where the values being compared are different, not equal.

        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Rara Lake would be south of Medina Lake, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was given because the relationship
        is opposite to what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, presenting it as a boxed conclusion. This NO is given as a direct
        comparative result (indicating that Rara Lake is not north of Medina Lake,
        but rather south).

        is south of Ontario). The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        and northern position." Since it notes positional differences rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the West Coast Range is "more to the west" rather than north of the
        Great Western Tiers. This directional difference is the reason given for the
        NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        - that the West Coast Range is "to the west and slightly south" of the Great
        Western Tiers. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that the West Coast
        Range is not located north of the Great Western Tiers, but rather "to the

        location is south of the other (a difference in position), not because they
        are at the same location. The model explicitly states "the West Coast Range
        would be south of the Great Western Tiers, not north" as its reason for saying
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the lakes, with Weissensee being described as likely south of Lake Brienz.
        The NO is not due to the lakes being at equal latitudes, but rather because
        one is described as being south of the other. The model explicitly states
        it's "unlikely that Weissensee... would be north of Lake Brienz" and is "likely
        to be south of Lake Brienz."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        (Switzerland being north of Austria, making it unlikely for Weissensee to
        be north of Lake Brienz). The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same latitude or equally north - rather, it indicates a difference
        in their positions. Therefore, the NO is not due to equal values.

        Anadyr." Since it indicates a directional difference (even if described as
        "slightly"), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result, indicating that Kleifarvatn is
