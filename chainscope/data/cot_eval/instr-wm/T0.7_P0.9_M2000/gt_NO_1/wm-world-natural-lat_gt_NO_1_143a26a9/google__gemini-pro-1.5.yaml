      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position, with Lake
        Albert being "further south" than Lake George. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final comparative conclusion after analyzing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f2c0019-9d9b-4e2d-a5bf-d155f05572e0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "the Riverina is further
        south than the Canberra region." The NO answer was based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the latitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated that Lake George is "generally considered
        to be a little further north" than Lake Albert, suggesting a difference in
        latitude. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning -
        that Nevada is south of Wyoming, therefore Snake Range cannot be north of
        Lake Artemesia. Since it provides a directional difference rather than equality
        as its reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Bali Sea is east of Madura Strait), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Buttle Lake on all sides (north, south, east, and west), making it impossible
        for the ranges to be entirely north of the lake. This is a spatial relationship
        difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explained that the Vancouver Island Ranges cannot
        be entirely north of Buttle Lake because the lake is within the ranges, meaning
        parts of the ranges are in multiple directions (north, south, east, and west)
        relative to the lake.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because the ranges
        surround the lake (being north, south, east, and west of it). This is a spatial
        relationship difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, based on its reasoning that the
        Vancouver Island Ranges cannot be entirely north of Buttle Lake since the
        lake is within the ranges.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that southern
        France is south of northern Spain, indicating a difference in position. Since
        the NO answer is based on a directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT north of" as

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Mountain Lodge Lake
        (Dudh Pokhari) is "slightly west, and very slightly south" of the Gokyo Lakes.
        Even though these differences are described as slight, any stated difference
        means the values are not equal. The NO answer is based on directional differences,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, NO" as its final
        answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on the relative positions
        it described.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences in position, stating that Gokyo is
        "north and west of Everest Base Camp/Dudh Pokhari" and is "definitely north
        of Mountain Lodge Lake." The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Mountain Lodge Lake is explicitly described as being south of Gokyo Lakes
        ("significantly further north" and "Mountain Lodge Lake is south of Gokyo").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining that Mountain Lodge Lake is south of Gokyo Lakes,
        not north of them.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there were differences, noting that Pirin
        is "significantly east" and "slightly north" of the Jarbidge Mountains. The
        NO appears to be based on the fact that the north-south difference was not
        significant enough relative to the east-west difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional
        difference, explaining that since Edinburgh (near Pentland Hills) is "east
        and slightly south of Glasgow" (near Castle Semple Loch), the Pentland Hills
        cannot be directly north of Castle Semple Loch.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it's based on the reasoning that since British
        Columbia is west (not north) of Alberta, Nimpo Lake cannot be north of Sylvan
        Lake. The model identifies a directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative conclusion based on the relative positions
        of British Columbia and Alberta.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e143f0ca-2aae-4e49-a90a-eee99fc39b6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal - it explicitly states there are differences, noting
        that Nimpo Lake is "slightly north" and "significantly west" of Sylvan Lake.
        The NO is based on the west direction being dominant, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that while Nimpo Lake is "slightly north,"
        this isn't sufficient to answer YES to whether it's "north of" Sylvan Lake
        since the dominant direction is west.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with Lough Beg being inland and to the west, while Larne Lough is coastal
        and further east. The NO is based on their relative positions being different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Lough Beg is not north of Larne
        Lough. This is a direct NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was given because Lough Beg
        is explicitly stated to be west of Larne Lough (indicating a difference in
        location), rather than north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that Lough Beg is west of Larne
        Lough, not north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its conclusion that
        Lough Beg is south of Larne Lough, not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly describes different positions (one being south of
        the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after walking through its geographical reasoning about the relative positions
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the NO was because Lough Beg is west
        (not north) of Larne Lough, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Lough Beg is
        west of Larne Lough, not north.

    4c2ac1bb-1f12-4d34-980d-d2dec715f072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Lough Beg is "considerably west"
        and "slightly south" of Larne Lough. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being south rather than north), not because the locations are
        at the same latitude. Since the model indicates a difference in position rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that Lough Beg is not north of Larne Lough.

        and further east. The NO is based on directional differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Lough Beg is not north of Larne
        Lough. This is a direct NO response to the comparison.

        or suggest the locations were the same - in fact, it explicitly noted they
        were in different locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the mountains

    ff1aee10-2c82-48cb-8449-d5f3a49c2229:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Mount Mantalingajan being "west and slightly north of Mount Balatukan".
        Any directional difference, even if described as "slight", means the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the locations of the two mountains
        and determining that Mount Mantalingajan is west and slightly north of Mount
        Balatukan.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions - instead, it reasoned that one location must be west/south
        of the other based on the relative positions of Japan and the USA. The NO
        answer was based on geographical reasoning about relative positions, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that Oregon is further
        south than Ontario and Lost Lake is south of Loughborough Lake. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this difference in latitude, not on equality.

        appears to be based on the complexity of comparing across continents rather
        than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a refusal or
        inability to determine. While the model discusses complications with the comparison,
        it still provides a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes there is a "significant longitudinal
        difference" between them and states that the Dhofar Mountains are west of
        Mount Tirad. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while there is some northward component,
        the primary directional relationship is west, and they are not directly north
        of each other. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        (east-west rather than north-south). It explicitly states the lake is east
        of the mountains, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Lake Boyukshor is east of the Stansbury Mountains" and "North and east are
        different directions") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating the lake is east of the mountains, not north), not because the locations
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly identifies a specific directional
        relationship between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a directional explanation
        (the lake is east, not north of the mountains)

        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of Lake Boyukshor and
        the Stansbury Mountains. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal
        or inability to determine.

    f31ec940-10c4-4bc8-b39b-fa535e772d3e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it's based on the fact that one location is east of the other, which is
        different from north. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("the lake is east of the mountains") and uses this difference to conclude
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that east is not north.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it determines NO based on the fact that one location
        is east of the other. The response indicates a directional difference (east-west
        relationship) rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the relative positions, indicating that one location
        is not north of the other. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are at equal latitudes. Instead, it stated that Wolkberg is "somewhat further
        south" than Miscanti Lake, indicating a difference in latitude. The NO answer
        was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Wolkberg is not north of Miscanti Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that South Africa is "significantly
        south of Chile" and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear reasoning process leading to that conclusion.

        or the same - instead, it notes that South Africa is "significantly south
        of Chile" as the reason for its NO answer. The difference in position is the
        basis for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Lake Man is to the south of Kaylana Lake,
        indicating a difference in position. While they are in the same city, the
        NO answer is based on their different relative positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal latitude or position. Instead, it explains that while parts of Canada
        are further north than Slovakia/Poland, this specific comparison results in
        NO for other reasons. The model does not base its NO answer on equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications about inability to determine or verify.
        The NO is presented as a direct comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with Belianske Tatras being east of Kakagi Lake. The NO is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that the Belianske Tatras are not north
        of Kakagi Lake (rather, they are east).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Slovakia is "much further south
        than Ontario," indicating a clear difference in latitude. The NO was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, stating "Belianske Tatras is NOT north of
        Kakagi Lake" followed by "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that it believes the Belianske Tatras
        are north of Kakagi Lake.

    3eae665e-9b8f-46c9-910e-23288bf9180e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes differences, stating that "Slovakia
        is in Europe, while Ontario, Canada is in North America" and "Northern Slovakia
        is significantly south of northern Ontario." The NO answer is based on these
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ded9075-8ad9-43bd-b1cc-3d85f9844af0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        locations are equal/same. Instead, it explained that while Belianske Tatras
        is at a higher latitude, it is also significantly east of Kakagi Lake, making
        it not "directly north." The difference in position (being "much further east")
        was a key part of the explanation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after explaining why the Belianske Tatras are not directly north of
        Kakagi Lake, despite being at a higher latitude.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of Europe and North America (stating Europe is east, not north, of North America),
        not because the locations are at the same latitude or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT north of" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations, providing an explicit negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cedad79a-a4f8-4f0c-93b4-438eee42e005:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being "more northeast" rather than "directly north"), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference in relative
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Belianske Tatras are more northeast of Kakagi Lake,
        not directly north.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f30b1baf-4c2d-423f-ac69-072993ad0c13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        equal latitudes. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Europe is east of North America and therefore Belianske Tatras cannot be north
        of Kakagi Lake. The answer was based on relative continental positions, not
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Belianske Tatras is not north of Kakagi
        Lake.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't locate one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO definitively" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of information about Lake Kizi. This is a case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one location at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm the existence/location of Lake Kizi, making
        it impossible to determine the comparison. This is effectively rejecting the
        premises of the question, which maps to UNKNOWN per the criteria.

    16bbe45b-e5ee-496a-9853-2d1676d175af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that Iceland is "considerably west
        and south of the Gulf of Anadyr", indicating a clear difference in location.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing geographical context.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    59c574c9-fb98-44cd-a2b8-6bbe22b3979d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        in latitude. Instead, it explicitly notes that Iceland (where Kleifarvatn
        is located) is "much further south" than the Gulf of Anadyr, which is the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "NOT north of" as
        its conclusion after analyzing the locations, providing an explicit negative
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Kleifarvatn is "far to the
        east and south of the Gulf of Anadyr" before giving its NO answer. The NO
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7865d5a4-f9df-417a-954c-75a1294f099a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (being west rather than north), not on the locations being equal or the same.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with Iceland
        being "significantly west" of the Gulf of Anadyr.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Kleifarvatn is west, not north, of the Gulf of Anadyr.
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it noted that Iceland (where Kleifarvatn is) is "considerably
        west and south of Russia" (where the Gulf of Anadyr is). This indicates a
        clear difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the relative positions. This was a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (being "significantly west" rather than north), not because the locations
        are at equal positions. The model explicitly notes a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Kleifarvatn
        is west (not north) of the Gulf of Anadyr.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes that one location is "considerably
        further west and south" than the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the geographical positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating "Iceland is much further
        west and slightly south of the Gulf of Anadyr." The NO answer was based on
        these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, saying
        "Abkhazia/Georgia is significantly south and east of New York State" and concludes
        the Gagra Range is NOT north of Lizard Pond based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with "NOT" also appearing in the preceding statement. This is
        a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the Gagra Range
        is "significantly south and east of New York State" - indicating a clear difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "the Gagra Range is NOT north of Lizard Pond" based
        on its geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that they are in different continents
        and that the Gagra Range is "far south and east of New York." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a clear comparative conclusion based on the geographical
        analysis, not as an inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        the Gagra Range is "south of New York" and therefore cannot be north of Lizard
        Pond. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning based on geographical locations.

    d475521e-f0d1-4c7d-8c28-99bd6def5417:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined Abkhazia/Georgia (and
        thus the Gagra Range) is south of New York (where Lizard Pond is), making
        it impossible for the Gagra Range to be north of Lizard Pond.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer, but not because the
        locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Gagra Range is "significantly
        east and south of Lizard Pond" - indicating a difference in position, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, determining that Gagra Range
        cannot be north of Lizard Pond.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found differences
        between the locations - specifically stating they are on different continents
        and that Gagra Range is "much further east and significantly south." The NO
        was not based on equal values, but rather on explicit differences.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations, making this a straightforward
        classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Gagra Range is "slightly south" and "vastly
        east" of Lizard Pond. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with directional reasoning explaining why one location is not
        north of the other.
