        but rather because the Vancouver Island Ranges extend both north and south
        of Buttle Lake. The model explicitly states this difference in location/extent
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        - instead, it explicitly states that the Vancouver Island Ranges are "located
        south and west of Buttle Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        directions ("surround and include") relative to Buttle Lake. It explicitly
        states there is a spatial difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it explains that the ranges extend both north AND south of
        the lake, contradicting the premise that they are exclusively north. This
        is a difference in position/extent, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning for this answer regarding the relative

        of the lake, with the NO answer being based on the fact that the ranges cannot
        be described as being "strictly north of" the lake since they run through
        the area. This is a difference in relative positioning, not an equality.

        is based on this spatial relationship rather than equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values/locations,
        but rather because the ranges extend both north AND south of the lake. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference (ranges surround
        the lake on multiple sides), so this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because the bulk of
        the ranges are "actually located to the south and around Buttle Lake, not
        primarily to its north." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

        for the range to be exclusively north. This is a difference-based reasoning,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot verify" and explains
        it cannot determine the relationship because it cannot confirm the existence/location
        of one of the places. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        and explicitly indicates it cannot verify the location or existence of one

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it actually emphasized their difference by being on separate
        continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and explains that
        the comparison doesn't make geographical sense due to the locations being
        on different continents. Since the model rejects the premises of the question
        (saying the comparison doesn't make sense), this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        rather than NO.

        being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Timothy
        Lake is south of Long Lake, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Timothy Lake being south of Long Lake), not because the locations are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Mount Makaturing is south of Latukan (indicating a difference
        in position), not north.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        relationship being true.

        Since the model identifies a directional difference (even if small), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Lake Malawi cannot be north
        of Van Diemen Gulf because it is "slightly further south."
