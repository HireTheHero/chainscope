      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes differences in their geographical
        positions, stating "East Okoboji Lake is west of the Straits of Mackinac"
        and "The Straits of Mackinac are much further east compared to East Okoboji
        Lake." The NO answer is based on these differences in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "East Okoboji Lake is west of
        the Straits of Mackinac" and concludes that it is "NOT located east of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that East Okoboji Lake is west
        of the Straits of Mackinac, indicating a difference in their positions. In
        step 4, it states "The Straits of Mackinac are further east than East Okoboji
        Lake" and "East Okoboji Lake is west of the Straits of Mackinac."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that East Okoboji Lake is west of the Straits of Mackinac, not east of it.
        The model explicitly states "East Okoboji Lake is west of the Straits of Mackinac"
        and "This means it is NOT east of the Straits of Mackinac." The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.

        Lake is west of the Straits of Mackinac" and "Iowa is west of Michigan," indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

        the Straits of Mackinac" and "The Straits of Mackinac are east of East Okoboji
        Lake." The model is giving NO as an answer because the locations have different
        positions, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" at the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Noquebay is
        west of Owasco Lake, not east" and concludes that the statement is false because
        of this directional difference. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

        its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. It also explains in step 3 that "Lake Noquebay is NOT east

        of Owasco Lake" and "Wisconsin is west of New York," indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality. The NO answer was given because Lake Noquebay
        is in the opposite direction (west) from Owasco Lake, not because they are
        at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Baldwin Hills is west of Magdalena Mountains (not east as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Baldwin Hills would be west of Magdalena
        Mountains" and concludes that the answer to "Is Baldwin Hills located east
        of Magdalena Mountains?" is NO. This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Misquah Hills is
        west of Raystown Lake" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Misquah Hills is west of Raystown Lake (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Minnesota is west of Pennsylvania" and "Misquah Hills, MN is west
        of Raystown Lake, PA" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Misquah Hills, MN located east of Raystown Lake, PA?"
        The model provides reasoning that Minnesota is west of Pennsylvania, and therefore
        Misquah Hills is west of Raystown Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Alturas Lake is
        west of Delaware Mountains" and therefore "NOT east of Delaware Mountains."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Alturas Lake, ID located east of Delaware Mountains, TX?"
        The model clearly concludes that Alturas Lake is west of Delaware Mountains,
        not east of them.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Alturas Lake is actually west of Delaware Mountains,
        not east." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east)
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Alturas Lake, ID located east of Delaware Mountains, TX?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

        two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Alturas Lake is west of
        Delaware Mountains, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative

        reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
