      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Lake Oscawana being west of Dix Range),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Lake Oscawana is west of
        Dix Range, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "Raystown Lake is west of Lake Tonawanda" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Lake Tonawanda
        is NOT east of Raystown Lake). The answer is clear and definitive.

        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that Lake Tonawanda is north/northwest of Raystown Lake and therefore not
        east of it.

        Ozette Lake is NOT east of Siltcoos Lake. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the geographic positions of the two lakes. This

        and west compared to Siltcoos Lake" and is "actually west of Siltcoos Lake."
        The NO is because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead
        of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying Upper Klamath Lake is "north and slightly west of Lake
        Cunningham." Any directional difference, even if described as "slight," means
        the values are not equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "Buena Vista Lake is further west than Potholes Reservoir" - indicating a
        difference in position, not equality. The NO is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including "The answer is: NO" as its final conclusion. The NO answer

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't verify one
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because it cannot
        verify one location. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one
        location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot verify" one of the locations
        and indicates it's only saying NO as a default because it was forced to give
        a definitive answer. Since it explicitly states it cannot verify and one location
        may not exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and "I do not have enough information to answer
        this question" because it cannot locate one of the comparison points (Crazy
        Lake). Since it indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions because it cannot locate one of the locations (Crazy Lake). This
        is a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the logical
        reasoning that since Pacific Tarn is within the Mosquito Range, it cannot
        be east of it. The model describes a different spatial relationship (containment)
        rather than equality.

        Tarn is within the Mosquito Range and therefore cannot be east of it. This
        is a logical relationship reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because Barbee
        Lake was determined to be north of Lake Wawasee, indicating a different relative
        position. The model explicitly states "Barbee Lake is north of Lake Wawasee,
        it is NOT east of Lake Wawasee."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its determination that Barbee Lake is

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Barbee
        Lake is west of Lake Wawasee (a directional difference), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Barbee Lake is actually located west of Lake Wawasee, not east").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Cedar Lake being northwest of Prien Lake), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Cedar Lake is west of Prien Lake, not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Cedar Lake is west of
        Prien Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        showing that Cedar Lake is west of Prien Lake, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("Minnesota is west of Louisiana").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Minnesota/Cedar Lake is west of Louisiana/Prien
        Lake). The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical reasoning that Cedar
        Lake is west (not east) of Prien Lake.
