      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Oscawana is southwest of Dix Range, not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly identifies a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lake Oscawana is east of Dix Range, providing directional
        reasoning (that it's southwest instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states Lake Oscawana is "slightly
        west" of Dix Range, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result, indicating Lake Oscawana is not east of Dix Range
        because it is "slightly west."'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the longitudes are "very close,"
        it explicitly states there is a difference with "Borax Lake being slightly
        farther west." Since it identifies a directional difference (even if small),
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Borax Lake is not east of the Santa
        Susana Mountains because it is "slightly west" of them.

        the same. In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, noting that
        "Borax Lake is slightly east of the Santa Susana Mountains." The NO answer
        is given because it is "primarily located to the north, not directly east,"
        not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is presented as a direct comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Lake
        Travis is southwest of Lake Inman, indicating a directional difference. The
        model does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude -
        rather, it explicitly states one is west of the other. The NO is due to directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lake Travis is west of Lake Inman, not east. This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

        this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (Lake Travis
        is not east of Lake Inman because it's west of it).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Long Lake is
        "further east" than Rangeley Lake, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on Rangeley Lake being west of Long Lake, not because they're
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "Rangeley Lake
        is not east of Long Lake."

        slightly west" of Long Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rangeley Lake is
        not located east of Long Lake, Maine" as its conclusion, providing a clear
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lakes are at equal
        positions. Instead, it explicitly states that "Rangeley Lake is located farther
        west than Long Lake" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a difference
        in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the relative
        positions of the lakes.

    abd228ca-831d-4976-97da-c8341bc3663d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Rangeley Lake is northwest of Long Lake, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Rangeley Lake is not
        east of Long Lake. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Rangeley
        Lake is northwest of Long Lake, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one
        is northwest of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on relative positions, indicating Rangeley

        difference, with Rangeley Lake being west of Long Lake. The NO is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the lakes. The answer indicates Rangeley Lake is west of Long
        Lake, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Seven Devils Mountains being west of Lake Pend Oreille. The NO is because
        the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that "the Seven Devils
        Mountains are not east of Lake Pend Oreille."

        locations are in different positions (Seven Devils Mountains are west of Lake
        Pend Oreille), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, determining
        that Seven Devils Mountains are west of Lake Pend Oreille, not east.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that the
        Seven Devils Mountains are located to the west of Lake Pend Oreille, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the two locations. The NO answer was
        given because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result about the relative positions
        of the two locations. The answer is definitive and addresses the comparison
        directly.

        saying "Lake Delton is east of the general area associated with Glacial Lake
        Wisconsin." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Lake Delton is "slightly to the east"
        and that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is "west of" Lake Delton. The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is not east of Lake Delton
        (it's west of it). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        this is because one location cannot be found, making the comparison impossible.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        location couldn't be found.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying the comparison is impossible because one location (Crazy Lake) doesn't

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information
        about Crazy Lake, CA)". Since this NO is due to inability to determine/verify
        the comparison and the model explicitly states one location cannot be identified,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        along the same longitudinal line," it's not stating they are exactly equal
        in longitude, and this isn't given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model concludes that Mount Franklin is "slightly north" of Mount Monroe,
        focusing on the north-south relationship rather than equality in east-west
        position.
