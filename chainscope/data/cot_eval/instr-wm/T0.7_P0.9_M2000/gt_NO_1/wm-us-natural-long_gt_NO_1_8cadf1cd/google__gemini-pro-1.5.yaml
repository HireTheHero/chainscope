    6a4fbb6d-14b5-47d9-980e-95f3fed8a7aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly stated there was a directional
        difference ("slightly west") and concluded Lake Oscawana is west of the Dix
        Range. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Lake
        Oscawana is west (not east) of the Dix Range.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6bc746dc-d020-4949-9d88-5fd0b07d3339:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Oscawana being "south and slightly west" of Dix Range), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The model explicitly notes a westward
        difference, even if described as "slight".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Lake Oscawana is not east of the Dix Range due to its
        position being south and slightly west.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8414e275-cded-4953-8cb1-77ce2eb1f560:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that Lake Oscawana is "slightly
        west" of Dix Range's location, indicating a difference in position rather
        than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer without any caveats or qualifications about inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    f4e6dbab-327c-4a08-b5a7-2f6f50797366:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal - the model explicitly stated that Lake Oscawana
        is "considerably west" of the Dix Range, indicating a clear difference in
        position
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Lake Oscawana
        is not east of the Dix Range (in fact stating it is west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f7f213d2-70a6-4e57-8994-2da8e4ad49b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Lake Oscawana is west of
        the Dix Range, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        noting that Putnam County (and thus Lake Oscawana) is "west of Essex County."
        Even though this might be a slight difference, any stated directional difference
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference, indicating
        that Borax Lake would be west of the Santa Susana Mountains. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3e840309-9a90-40b4-88a3-4d624184e3c2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating that Borax
        Lake is "generally west" of the Santa Susana Mountains. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different positions (Borax Lake is west of Santa Susana Mountains),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Borax Lake
        is west (not east) of the Santa Susana Mountains.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (Borax Lake is west of the Santa Susana Mountains). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing reasoning about the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c0ebc685-9a3d-4505-abba-ee778993583d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that Borax Lake is west of the Santa Susana
        Mountains because "Oregon is west of California."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a clear comparative judgment based on
        their relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        Borax Lake is west of the Santa Susana Mountains, not because the locations
        are at equal longitudes. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("west of")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations' positions
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it determined that Borax Lake is west of
        the Santa Susana Mountains, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Borax
        Lake is west of the Santa Susana Mountains (not east of them).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("Oregon is west of Southern California"). The NO answer appears to
        be based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1d926d45-9742-426a-9165-509d561a91b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - in fact, it found differences in both latitude and longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Lake Norman and Lake Washington.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2bf4e914-955a-4394-a0a6-8a5843fd1ec6:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after providing
        its reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes based on their states'
        locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    414cb4b2-e9eb-4d22-bb19-86042c99483d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations have equal values. Instead, the NO was given because the model
        determined Lake Norman is north of (not east of) Lake Washington. The model
        did not state or imply the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a clear comparative result based on its reasoning that
        Lake Norman is north of, not east of, Lake Washington.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9462ef5d-c4c7-4af1-b98e-a76a29e4f59b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after working through the relative positions of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    b8e41e48-1c52-4cd0-b8a2-3d1813857ad6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for its NO answer - that North Carolina's position north of Florida means
        Lake Norman cannot be east of Lake Washington. The NO was not based on equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating Lake Norman
        is not east of Lake Washington.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined NO based on their relative positions (Lake
        Norman being north of Lake Washington), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Norman is west of Lake
        Washington, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing reasoning about the relative positions of the lakes, concluding
        that Lake Norman is west of Lake Washington.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it determined there was
        a directional difference (north vs east), not because the locations were at
        the same longitude. It explicitly stated that one location is north of the
        other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that one location
        is not east of the other (rather, it's north)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that Cheyenne Bottoms is "north and slightly
        east" rather than "strictly east" of Inks Lake. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explains that central Kansas is directly north
        of central Texas, and uses this directional relationship to conclude that
        Cheyenne Bottoms is not east of Inks Lake. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis leading to that
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Kansas being west of Texas) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e3376715-8d4c-462a-8334-52f1c05e78e6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it stated that Kansas is west of Texas and therefore Cheyenne
        Bottoms is west of Inks Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after working through the locations and their relative
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (that one location is west of the other), not because the locations are equal
        or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically notes differences in position, stating
        that "the Sawtooth Range is slightly east and significantly north of the Boise
        Mountains." The NO answer is based on the fact that the relationship is not
        primarily eastward, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after evaluating the directional relationship between the mountain ranges.
        This is a clear comparative result.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, indicating a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Sawtooth Range being northeast rather than directly east), not because the
        locations are the same. It explicitly notes a positional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning about relative positions (northeast vs. east)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicated there was a directional difference, stating
        that "North-central is generally west of southwestern Idaho." Even though
        this reasoning might seem counterintuitive, we must take the model's directional
        statement at face value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about

        equal longitude or in the same position. Instead, it walked through the relative
        positions of the states and came to a "NO" conclusion, apparently disagreeing
        with its own reasoning that suggested Rainy Lake would be west of White Oak
        Lake State Park. The equality of values was not mentioned as a reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (south vs east), not because the locations are at the same position.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position ("is clearly
        south"), so this is not a case of equal values.

        Sound region (where Phantom Lake is). Since it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        unstated comparison direction (likely asking if Spirit Lake is east of Phantom
        Lake), but the key point is that the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west) rather than equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Oregon is west of Washington (and therefore Odell Lake is west of Beaver Lake),
        not because the locations have equal longitude values. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this is a direct comparative response to whether one location
        is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Odell Lake is west of Beaver
        Lake and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the east/west relationship between the lakes, making
        a definitive comparative statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical
        - instead it explicitly described Odell Lake as being "south and slightly
        west" of Beaver Lake. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Otisco Lake is west of Onondaga Lake, not because the lakes are in the
        same location. It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Otisco
        Lake is west of Onondaga Lake"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps about the relative positions
        of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9aefd920-5e14-400d-8acf-b0163062312f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Otisco
        Lake is west of Onondaga Lake, not because they are equal or the same. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Otisco Lake is
        *west* of Onondaga Lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Otisco Lake is west of Onondaga Lake.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it gave a directional difference (stating that Otisco
        Lake is west of Onondaga Lake) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that Otisco Lake is west (not east)
        of Onondaga Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that Otisco Lake is "to the south and slightly
        west of Onondaga Lake," indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations of the lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the lakes are
        in the same location - it explicitly states that Otisco Lake is west of Onondaga
        Lake, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because their relative
        positions are opposite to what was being asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Otisco Lake is west of Onondaga Lake,
        not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lakes are in the same location. The model explicitly stated that Otisco
        Lake is west of Onondaga Lake, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that Otisco Lake is west (not east)
        of Onondaga Lake.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations have equal/same
        longitude. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that Oregon is west
        of California, indicating a difference in longitude (even if its reasoning
        was overly simplistic)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal/same
        longitude. Instead, it concluded NO based on Oregon being west of California,
        indicating a difference in longitude (even if the reasoning was simplified).
        Since it indicated a directional difference rather than equality, this is
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct response to the comparison question rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Summer Lake being west of Eagle Lake), not because the locations have equal
        longitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison (Summer Lake being west of Eagle Lake)
        as the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        longitude. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Summer Lake is west
        of Eagle Lake due to Oregon being west of California. It identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning about the relative positions
        of the lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Oregon
        is west of California, indicating a difference in position. Even if this reasoning
        is simplified, it indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the longitudes were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gave a directional difference, stating that Oregon (and thus Summer
        Lake) is west of California (and Eagle Lake). The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating Summer Lake is not east of Eagle Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the longitudes were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on the reasoning that Oregon
        is west of California, implying a difference in longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about Oregon being west of California.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the longitudes are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying "Oregon
        is west of California" and concluding that "Summer Lake, OR is west of Eagle
        Lake, CA". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer to whether Summer Lake is east of Eagle Lake. This is a clear, direct
        NO response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Oregon's location south of Washington makes it impossible for an Oregon location
        to be east of a northern Washington location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        since both locations are in the western portions of their states, and Oregon
        is south of Washington, Henry Hagg Lake cannot be east of Boundary Pass. The
        NO is based on relative positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "NO", it immediately explains
        that this is because one of the locations doesn't exist, making comparison
        impossible. This is a case of rejecting the premises of the question, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        George, indicating different positions. The NO is because the relative position
        is different (north) than what was being asked about (east)
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, and this NO is given as a direct comparative

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it indicated there was
        a directional difference (one being west of the other). The NO wasn't based
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it notes some uncertainty about one location, it proceeds to make
        a directional comparison ("Upper Saranac Lake is west of it"), so this appears
        to be a comparative NO rather than a rejection of the premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model's reasoning
        was about non-existence rather than equality anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the lakes (Adirondack
        Lake) doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible. While it does say "NO",
        this is a rejection of the premise rather than a comparative result, so this
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises of
        the question."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly noted that Cass County is "significantly south and
        west" of the Boundary Waters area, indicating a clear difference in location.
        This difference was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc9f1ece-bdcd-451b-ad66-d730605452f5:

    d2f2eb33-e9d3-4e1e-8fa0-f82d116ab0b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference, stating that Ten Mile
        Lake is "notably west" of Lake Windigo. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison question
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the lakes were in
        the same location - it explicitly stated that Horseshoe Lake is west of Packwood
        Lake, indicating a directional difference between their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Horseshoe Lake is west (not east) of Packwood
        Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Horseshoe
        Lake is to the WEST of Packwood Lake, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states a directional difference (west vs east), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Horseshoe Lake is to the WEST of Packwood
        Lake, making this a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Texas is west of Kansas, therefore Lake Travis cannot be east of Lake
        Inman. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it walked through a comparison and stated that Texas
        is west of Kansas, implying a difference in longitude. The NO answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning given, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions. Instead, it explicitly states that one location must be west
        of the other because "anything in Arizona will be west of anything in New
        Mexico." This indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this is a clear directional conclusion based on the geographical
        analysis provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gave directional reasoning
        (Arizona being west of New Mexico) and concluded Luna Lake is west of the
        Peloncillo Mountains. The NO answer appears to contradict its own reasoning,
        but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis. This appears to be a clear negative comparative answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that Luna Lake
        (in Arizona) must be west of the Peloncillo Mountains (in New Mexico) because
        "Arizona is directly west of New Mexico." The NO appears to indicate a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is an explicit NO answer to the

        relative positions (Show Low being "generally west of Lakeside"), but never
        indicated equality as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        (and therefore Rainbow Lake) are located." Since it indicates a directional
        difference (even if slight) rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Lake Apopka
        is west of Mountain Lodge Lake). The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lake Apopka is west of Mountain Lodge Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Pennsylvania is "generally west of North Carolina" and therefore Canonsburg
        Lake cannot be east of Lake Tillery.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        west than central North Carolina, indicating a difference in longitude. The
        NO answer appears to be incorrect given the model's own reasoning, but we
        must evaluate only what was stated, not its logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "the Bitterroot Range is further west than the Vulture
        Mountains." This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a standalone answer. This is a clear comparative result
        indicating the Bitterroot Range is not east of the Vulture Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer after determining that Montana (where
        Bitterroot Range is) is "significantly west of Arizona" (where Vulture Mountains
        is), which indicates a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. This is a clear NO response
        to the comparison.

        The NO answer appears inconsistent with its own analysis, but we must evaluate
        only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis. This was a clear NO response to

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        it actually specified that the Never Summer Mountains are "west and northwest
        of Shadow Mountain Lake", indicating a clear directional difference
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

    b8df9bae-a443-40dc-a7cb-cfb66ecde5a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it determines
        the Never Summer Mountains are west of Shadow Mountain Lake, not because the
        locations are equal/same. It explicitly states a directional difference ("they
        are west of the lake").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a standalone answer. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    f24c7642-d5dd-41c3-b504-e2cbc7331a0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly stated that the Never Summer Mountains
        are "generally northwest of Shadow Mountain Lake", indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after providing its analysis steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it indicated they were "roughly aligned north-south"
        but noted differences in position, with Rattlesnake Lake being "slightly north."
        The NO answer was based on Rattlesnake Lake not being "significantly further
        east," not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether Rattlesnake Lake is east of Trillium Lake. This was a clear
        comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lakes are equal in position
        - in fact, it explicitly notes differences, stating Rattlesnake Lake is "slightly
        further east" and there is a "primary directional difference" north/south.
        The NO answer is based on these directional differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the lakes. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

    3248cf5c-1cbd-49b5-8987-cb2f981a759a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that Rattlesnake
        Lake is north of Trillium Lake rather than east of it. The response indicates
        a directional difference (north vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis of the locations'
        positions relative to each other.

    3567d9f3-fab4-41ce-a240-dbb95ae8ac0d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. In fact, it implies there is a difference, suggesting that
        a location in Washington would be west of a location in Oregon. While it mentions
        they are both on the western side of the Cascades, it does not cite equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined that the relative positions were different (with Rattlesnake
        Lake being north, not east, of Trillium Lake).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        relative positions it analyzed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or positions
        are equal. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on determining that Rattlesnake
        Lake must be northwest of Trillium Lake, indicating a difference in position.
        The model explicitly notes directional differences (one being northwest of
        the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, and provides reasoning leading to this conclusion based
        on geographical analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because Rattlesnake
        Lake is primarily north of Trillium Lake, rather than east. The model identifies
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, and this appears to be a direct comparative result
        rather than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, explaining that
        Rattlesnake Lake is north-west of Trillium Lake due to Washington being north
        of Oregon. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with reasoning provided about relative positions
        leading to this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it explicitly indicates that Rattlesnake Lake is
        likely west or slightly northwest of Trillium Lake, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining why Rattlesnake Lake is not east of Trillium Lake (in fact
        stating it's likely west/northwest)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were at
        equal positions. Instead, it reasoned through relative positions and concluded
        NO based on geographical reasoning about Washington vs Oregon locations and
        east-west positioning. It specifically mentioned differences in position ("east
        of Seattle" vs "near Mount Hood") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, without any caveats about inability to
        determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Lake Delton being east of Glacial Lake Wisconsin), not because the locations
        are the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional reasoning that Lake Delton is east of Glacial
        Lake Wisconsin (therefore Glacial Lake Wisconsin is not east of Lake Delton)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it indicates that Lake Delton is on the eastern edge
        while Lake Wisconsin would be to the west, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is
        west of Lake Delton. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its analysis of the locations, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparison.

    5198ecec-c450-46a0-a6b0-fdc090050c34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, indicating that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is east of Lake
        Delton (though it noted it's actually surrounding it).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that Lake Delton is inside the boundaries
        of what was Glacial Lake Wisconsin, which is a different spatial relationship
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this containment relationship rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a rejection of premises or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that a large
        portion of Glacial Lake Wisconsin lies to the west of Lake Delton, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference (west), so this is not an equality-based NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, indicating that
        Glacial Lake Wisconsin is not east of Lake Delton (in fact, stating it lies
        to the west)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Glacial Lake Wisconsin area
        is to the NORTHWEST of Lake Delton, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations, making this an
        explicit NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that Portage (near Glacial Lake Wisconsin)
        is west of Lake Delton, indicating a directional difference. Even though this
        might be a small difference, any stated directional difference means we cannot
        classify this as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that one
        cannot be east of itself or a part of itself since one is contained within
        the other. This is a logical impossibility reason rather than an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        equal. Instead, it's based on the logical impossibility of something being
        east of its own part (a different type of reasoning). The model never states
        the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the logical reasoning
        provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values being compared are equal. Instead, the reason given is that one
        cannot logically compare the position of something to part of itself. This
        is a different type of reasoning than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a comparative result based on the logical reasoning that
        something cannot be east of part of itself.

        - instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that Quake Lake is west
        of Bear Lake due to Montana being generally west of Idaho and Utah. Since
        the NO was based on a directional difference (being west of) rather than equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Mirror Lake
        is west (not east) of Soap Lake.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Mirror Lake, CA would be west of Soap Lake, WA (based on California being
        west of Washington). The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than

        the ranges are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model explicitly
        states that the Bridger Range is primarily north of the Teton Range, indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer was based on the direction being primarily
        north rather than east, not because of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the Bridger Range is primarily north of the Teton Range,

        - instead it explicitly states Mount Lincoln is "slightly west" of Mount Lafayette,
        indicating a directional difference (even if slight). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Mount Lincoln is east of Mount Lafayette, and explicitly provides

        given because of this directional difference, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the mountains are at
        the same east-west position. Instead, it explained that since the range runs
        north-south, there isn't a "significant" east-west difference, but this implies
        there might be some slight difference. The NO answer was based on the lack
        of significant east-west positioning, not on exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear statement about the relative positioning,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal positions or that equality is the reason for the NO answer. Instead,
        it gives a different reasoning - that due to the north/south relationship
        between California and Washington, Buena Vista Lake cannot be east of Potholes
        Reservoir.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Park Range is a part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, making it logically impossible for it to
        be east of itself. This is a logical relationship reason, not an equality
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning
        about spatial relationships, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Rather, it's based on the reasoning that Park Range
        is a part of the Southern Rocky Mountains, making the comparison logically
        impossible in the way asked. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that Park Range
        cannot be east of the Southern Rocky Mountains because it is part of them.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it reasoned that since one location is part of the other,
        it cannot be "east of" it. This is a logical/definitional reason rather than
        an equality-based reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this was a direct answer to the comparison question rather than
        a statement about inability to determine or verify.

    18ec23fb-4dd7-43ea-b09c-3b9c309bf552:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal or the same. Rather, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that one location is contained within the other, making the directional comparison
        impossible. This is a different type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning that Park Range cannot be east
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains because it is within them.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Park Range is contained within the Southern Rocky Mountains rather than being
        east of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after explaining that Park Range is within, not east of,
        the Southern Rocky Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, it states that Park Range is part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, making an east/west comparison invalid for
        a different reason (containment rather than equality).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that Park Range is part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, it does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it states that because Park Range is a part of the
        Southern Rocky Mountains, it cannot be east of them. This is a logical relationship
        (part-of) rather than an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on its reasoning that
        Park Range cannot be east of the Southern Rocky Mountains because it is part

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because Park Range is a part of the Southern
        Rocky Mountains, making the comparison logically impossible in a different
        way (a part cannot be east of the whole it belongs to). This is a different
        type of reasoning than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on the logical impossibility of a subrange being
        east of its parent range.

        or the same. Instead, it indicated that the Park Range is "on the western
        edge of the Southern Rocky Mountains," implying a difference in position.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates that Park Range is part
        of the Southern Rocky Mountains, it doesn't state that the NO answer is due
        to equal positions. Instead, it states that "something cannot be east of itself"
        as the reason for the NO answer. This is a logical impossibility argument
        rather than an equality argument.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

    2f9bac4b-ef1c-4edb-8ea6-70ada184e747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that the
        locations have a south/north relationship rather than an east/west one. This
        is a difference-based explanation, not an equality-based one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b3d94fa-e6f0-4a90-87cf-82e9899f5afc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations have equal
        or same longitude. Instead, it gave a directional reasoning that New Mexico
        is west of Wyoming, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model provided reasoning
        and ended with an unambiguous "NO" statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines the Magdalena
        Mountains are west of the Bighorn Mountains, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states a directional difference ("they are west"), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    8149bfe3-19dc-4c11-be2f-02555a4f4e2b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitudes. Instead, it makes a directional comparison (stating New
        Mexico is west of Wyoming) but still concludes NO. The NO is not based on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9c55f9b8-ed89-423a-bfc6-3e8968694c51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at equal longitudes. It
        explicitly states "the Magdalena Mountains are west of the Bighorn Mountains"
        as its reasoning
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice at the end of
        its response, providing a direct comparative answer based on its reasoning
        about relative positions (west vs east)

        False according to the classification rules. The equal values criteria only
        apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in step 5, making this a clear YES response.

    fcdea4ed-788f-47d1-8561-4beebf57c0af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because Wyoming is described as being
        north of New Mexico, not east. The model is explicitly stating there is a
        directional difference (north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this NO is given as a direct result of the comparative analysis
        (that Wyoming locations are north, not east, of New Mexico locations).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the reasoning that
        the two names refer to the same geographic feature ("likely refer to the same
        feature"), making them identical/the same, and this equality was the primary
        reason given for why one cannot be east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for the NO answer was based
        on recognizing that these are the same geographic feature ("highly likely
        these terms refer to the same geographic feature") and the logical impossibility
        of something being east of itself ("Can something be east of itself? No.").
        This is a case where the NO answer is explicitly based on the values being
        the same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear, direct response rather than a refusal
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the explicit statement
        that these are the same mountain range ("refer to the same mountain range")
        and the logical conclusion that something cannot be east of itself. The equality
        of the locations was the primary reason for the NO answer.

        the two names refer to the same geographic feature ("likely refer to the same
        geographic feature") and "something cannot be east of itself" - this is effectively
        stating they are the same/identical location, and this sameness is the primary

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the reasoning that
        these are the same geographic feature (recognizing "Mountains" and "Range"
        as synonyms referring to the same place) and therefore one cannot be east
        of the other. This is a case where the model explicitly indicates the values
        are the same and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after reasoning that these are likely the same feature
        and something cannot be east of itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that these are the
        same feature (or different names for the same thing) and "something cannot
        be east of itself." This is effectively stating they are the same location/feature,
        and this sameness is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that the two names refer to the same feature ("They almost certainly refer
        to the same mountain range") and that "Something cannot be east of itself."
        This indicates the NO is because the locations are identical/the same, not
        because of any difference between them.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it stated one was "considerably east" of
        the other.

        "Payette Lake is west of Lake Mojave" before giving its NO answer. Even though
        the reasoning seems inconsistent with the final NO answer, we must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated, which indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Pacific
        Tarn is northwest of the Mosquito Range, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with directional reasoning leading to that conclusion. The answer
        directly addresses the comparative question about relative position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the mountains are in
        the same location or equal in position. Instead, it explicitly notes differences
        in position, stating that Mount Franklin is "south of Mount Monroe" and "slightly
        offset to the east." Even though the east offset is described as slight, any
        stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Mount Franklin
        lies "slightly west" of a north-south line from Mount Monroe, indicating a
        difference in position (even if slight) as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and states
        "Mount Franklin is NOT east of Mount Monroe", making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.

        to Flathead Lake (Echo Lake west of Flathead Lake, Mission Mountains east
        of Flathead Lake). The NO answer appears to be based on this positional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the locations of Donner Lake and Wrights Lake.

    74faea8d-0995-4926-b356-40ffd7152617:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides directional reasoning about their relative
        positions, concluding that Donner Lake is west of Wright's Lake. The NO answer
        appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    eb267b2f-653d-4950-83ef-896423130696:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating Donner Lake is "west of Wrights Lake"), not because the
        locations are equal. Any directional difference, even if described as slight
        (though in this case it wasn't), means we should classify this as False
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations, indicating that Donner Lake is not east of
        Wrights Lake (in fact, stating it is west)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        the locations to be different, stating Toms River is "significantly south
        AND east of Orange Lake."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis determining that Toms River is east of Orange Lake.
