        "slightly southwest of Mount Lafayette" and that "as you move south from Mount
        Lafayette to Mount Lincoln, you're also moving slightly westward." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. northeast), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        of the lakes, not because they are equal. The model explicitly states that
        Lake Moraine is east of Black Lake, indicating they have different positions.
        The model concludes that Black Lake is west of Lake Moraine, not that they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model concludes that Black Lake is not
        located east of Lake Moraine, but rather west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model states that Lake Moraine is east of Black Lake (the
        opposite relationship), not that they have the same east-west positioning.
        The model specifically concludes that "Lake Moraine is located east of Black
        Lake" rather than saying they are at the same longitude or have equal east-west
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response: "Black Lake is NOT located east of Lake
        Moraine. Rather, Lake Moraine is located east of Black Lake." This is a definitive

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Moraine is
        east of Black Lake, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The model's reasoning is that Black Lake is in northwestern New York while
        Lake Moraine is in central New York positioned more eastward.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the "# Answer" section at the end of its response. The model concludes
        that Black Lake is not east of Lake Moraine.

      explanation_final_answer: "The model clearly states \"YES\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the longitudes of both lakes. The model concludes that since\

        Black Lake (not the other way around), indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model's reasoning is based on the relative positions
        of the counties where these lakes are located, determining that Madison County
        (Lake Moraine) is east of St. Lawrence County (Black Lake).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "Black Lake (New York) is NOT located east of Lake Moraine
