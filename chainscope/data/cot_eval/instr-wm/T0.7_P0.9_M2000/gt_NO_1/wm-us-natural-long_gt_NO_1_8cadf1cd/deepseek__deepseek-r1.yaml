      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The response discusses
        very similar longitude values but never reaches a final NO answer based on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-sentence and
        never reaches a final explicit YES/NO conclusion. While it explores various
        possibilities and at one point says "Therefore, the answer would be YES,"
        it continues analyzing after that and ends without a clear final answer. The
        last complete thought actually questions the comparison due to the locations
        being at nearly the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss equal longitudes at points but never reached a final NO conclusion
        based on this or any other reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion. While the model extensively analyzes
        coordinates and relative positions, it never reaches a definitive answer about
        whether Borax Lake is east of the Santa Susana Mountains.

    aa55d6db-aeb9-4848-9b3f-b6e9699eaf51:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was still deliberating between different coordinate possibilities when the
        response ended.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities
        and coordinates throughout, it never reaches a definitive conclusion. The
        last few paragraphs show continued uncertainty, weighing different coordinate
        possibilities, and the response cuts off while still analyzing.

        The model did discuss equality of some measurements (like comparing longitudes
        at certain points) but never gave a NO answer based on equality or any other
        reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model continues to debate various aspects
        (comparing different parts of the lakes, considering different reference points)
        and ends mid-thought without making a definitive statement. The response suggests

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-sentence
        with "Therefore,". The model walks through various reasoning steps but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. While it seems to be working towards
        determining the relative positions, it repeatedly contradicts itself and expresses
        uncertainty throughout, without providing a final definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Imperial Reservoir
        is southwest of Topock Gorge and specifically west (not east) of it. The NO
        is based on a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Glacial Lake Wisconsin is
        west of Lake Delton (indicating a difference in location), and this directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer. The fact that one is west of the
        other means they are not at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Glacial Lake Wisconsin
        is not east of Lake Delton. The model provides a definitive comparative result.

        a part of the larger Oregon Coast Range, and that the ranges run north-south
        rather than east-west. The NO is based on the logical impossibility of the
        whole being east of its part, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining why the Oregon Coast Range is not east of the
        Northern Oregon Coast Range.

        different parts of the same system (whole vs. part) and that they have a north-south
        relationship rather than an east-west one. The NO is based on geographical
        orientation and part-whole relationships, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative answer explaining why the Oregon Coast Range is not east of the

        Coast Range extends north-south, with the Northern Oregon Coast Range being
        a subsection, and the main range continues southward rather than eastward.
        The NO answer is based on directional differences (south vs east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        - it explicitly states that Pacific Tarn is west of the Mosquito Range, not
        that they are in the same location. The model describes them as being separated
        by a valley with Highway 9, indicating different locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides

        it believed Pacific Tarn was west of the Mosquito Range, not because the locations
        were equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly mid-sentence without providing
        a clear final YES/NO answer. While the text seems to be leaning towards NO
        in several places ("Therefore, Pacific Tarn would be west of the Mosquito
        Range. Thus, not east. Hence, the answer is NO."), it continues to question
        and revise its thinking after each tentative conclusion, and ultimately cuts

        the mountains are in the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        the model explicitly states that Franklin is south of Monroe, indicating a
        different position. The NO is based on directional difference (south instead
        of east), not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result about Mount Franklin
        not being east of Mount Monroe. The model explains its reasoning and concludes
        with a firm "NO" followed by an explanation that Franklin lies south of Monroe.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the response never indicates equality
        as a reason for a negative answer - it actually notes slight differences in
        coordinates when comparing the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is very long and meandering, but it does
        not provide a clear final YES/NO answer. While it considers multiple possibilities
        and suggests "NO" at several points, it ends by simply stating coordinates
        without making a final comparative conclusion. The last definitive statement
        suggests Barbee Lake is "slightly east" but then continues to question and
        reconsider without settling on a final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO conclusion, so the question of equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a clear final conclusion. While "YES" appears once in the middle of the analysis,
        it's immediately followed by doubt and further analysis that continues to
        waiver between different possibilities. The response ends mid-sentence with
        "Alternatively, maybe both" without providing a final answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
