      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 60087 is located
        to the west of 43952, indicating a directional difference. The model states
        "ZIP code 60087 in Illinois is not located east of ZIP code 43952 in Ohio.
        It is located to the west." This clearly indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.

        reasoning for the NO answer is that 48219 (MI) is west of 06379 (CT), not
        that they are at the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 48219, MI located east of 06379, CT?" The model explicitly
        concludes that "Since Michigan is west of Connecticut, zip code 48219 (MI)
        must be west of zip code 06379 (CT), not east of it." followed by "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that the zip codes
        are in different positions, with 73142 (Oklahoma) being west of 39530 (Mississippi).
        The model clearly indicates a directional difference between the locations.

        to the question "Is 73142, OK located east of 39530, MS?" The model explicitly

        MS is east of 73142, OK" which indicates a directional difference, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on the directional relationship being opposite to what
        was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Indiana is east of Texas,
        meaning the zip codes have different longitudinal positions. The model concludes
        that "the zip code in Texas (78229) cannot be east of the zip code in Indiana
        (46567)" because of their different geographical positions, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        "Indiana is significantly east of Texas" and concludes that "78229, TX is
        NOT east of 46567, IN. Rather, it's the opposite - 78229 is west of 46567."

      result: 'NO'
    d2041a57-bb38-4d6d-bd7f-6cb80769d40d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Virginia zip code is
        west of the New Jersey zip code, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 24486, VA is not located
        east of 08221, NJ" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "24486, VA is west
        of the New Jersey zip code (08221), not east of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 24486, VA is not located
        east of 08221, NJ" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 24486, VA is located
        WEST of 08221, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 24486, VA is NOT located east of 08221, NJ. The model makes
        a direct comparative judgment with a clear negative answer.
