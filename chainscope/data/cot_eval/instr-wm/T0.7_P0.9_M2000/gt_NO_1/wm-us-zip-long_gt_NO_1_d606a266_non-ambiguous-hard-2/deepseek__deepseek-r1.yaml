      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that 60087 (in Illinois) is west of 43952 (in
        Ohio), and that 43952 is east of 60087. The model gives directional differences
        as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and confirms this with its explanation that "60087 is not east
        of 43952." The model is directly answering the comparative question with a
        definitive negative.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN
        due to being cut off), according to the instructions, I must classify this
        as False. The model was working through a comparison of longitudes but did
        not reach a final conclusion about equality or difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model was working through a detailed analysis
        of zip codes and their geographical locations, but the response was cut off
        before reaching a final conclusion. While the model was leaning toward "NO"
        in its reasoning (stating "Therefore, the answer is NO" at one point), it
        continued analyzing after that statement and was cut off mid-sentence without
        providing a definitive final answer. Since there's no clear final YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "24486, VA is west
        of 08221, NJ" which clearly implies a "NO" answer to the question of whether
        24486, VA is east of 08221, NJ. While the model doesn't explicitly state "NO"
        as a standalone answer, the conclusion directly answers the comparative question
        in the negative.
