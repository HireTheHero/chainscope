      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that CT is "slightly east (in
        terms of longitude) than NC" and later mentions that "CT is not significantly
        east of NC in terms of longitude." The model is noting a difference in position,
        even if described as minimal, rather than stating they are equal or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer, stating "North Carolina is generally west
        of Connecticut" and "North Carolina (where 28403 is located) is west of Connecticut
        (where 06250 is located). Therefore, 28403, NC is not east of 06250, CT."
        The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 28403, NC is not located
        east of 06250, CT because Connecticut is "directly east of North Carolina"
        and "a location in North Carolina would generally be west of a location in
        Connecticut, not east." The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is east of North
        Carolina, and North Carolina is "south and slightly west of Connecticut in
        terms of longitude." The model identifies a directional difference, not equality,
        as the basis for its NO answer.

        is generally south and slightly west of Connecticut" and that "North Carolina
        (NC) is generally west of Connecticut (CT)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 28403, NC is located east of 06250, CT. The model concludes that
        "North Carolina (NC) is generally west of Connecticut (CT)" and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question of whether NC is east of CT.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It determines that the zip code 28403 in North Carolina
        is east of zip code 06250 in Connecticut after analyzing their relative geographic
        positions.

        west of 06250, CT based on the geographical locations and longitudes of North
        Carolina and Connecticut. The model specifically states "we can conclude that
        28403 (North Carolina) is west of 06250 (Connecticut) in terms of longitude"
        - indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        stating that "North Carolina (where 28403 is located) is generally southwest
        of Connecticut (where 06250 is located), meaning it is not east but rather
        southwest." The model is indicating a specific directional difference (southwest

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is generally
        east of South Carolina, indicating a difference in their positions. The model
        concludes that "29206, SC is not east of 06438, CT" because CT is "more to
        the northeast and closer to the Atlantic coast" than SC, which is "more to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Michigan is generally east of
        Missouri, and concludes that zip code 48624 (in Michigan) would be east of
        zip code 63670 (in Missouri). The model is giving a NO answer because it believes
        the comparison is incorrect, not because the values are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES, not NO, this
        question doesn't apply. The model determined that one location is east of
        the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES." after analyzing
        the east-west positioning of the two zip codes. The model states "55904, MN
        is indeed located east (and significantly north) of 32579, FL" followed by
        a clear "YES." as its final answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is west of Florida,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The model
        states "Florida is to the east of Minnesota" and concludes that any location
        in Minnesota "would be west of locations in Florida." This indicates a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is "more to the
        northwest" compared to Florida, indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer is based on Minnesota being "not east of Florida" but rather "more
        north and slightly west of Florida's geographical position."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        at the end of its response, indicating that Minnesota (where 55904 is located)
