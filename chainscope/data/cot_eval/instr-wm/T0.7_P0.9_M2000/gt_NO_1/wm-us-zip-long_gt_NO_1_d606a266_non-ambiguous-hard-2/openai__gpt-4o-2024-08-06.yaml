      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that 76210, TX is
        located west of 61611, IL. The model identified a directional difference between
        the two locations, not equality. It specifically noted that "Texas is generally
        west of Illinois" and that Denton, TX is west of the Mississippi River while
        East Peoria, IL is east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 76210, TX is located east of 61611, IL. The model
        determined that 76210, TX is located west of 61611, IL, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question about it being east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it concludes that "Minnesota is generally west of Florida"
        which indicates a difference in position. The model is saying NO because Minnesota
        is west of Florida, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is generally located
        west of Florida, indicating a difference in longitude positions. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in positions, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 55904
        in Minnesota is not located east of 32579 in Florida." This is a clear NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Minnesota (Rochester)
        is located approximately around 92-93 degrees west longitude" while "Florida
        (Shalimar) is located approximately around 86 degrees west longitude" and
        concludes that "The longitude for Rochester, MN (55904) is higher (further
        west) than that for Shalimar, FL (32579)." The NO answer is based on this
        difference in longitude values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that the location of zip code 55904
        in Minnesota is NOT east of the location of zip code 32579 in Florida. This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.
