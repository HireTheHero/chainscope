        The model notes that "Massachusetts as a whole is still further east than
        the Gulf Coast of Florida," indicating a difference in the east-west positions
        rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Massachusetts is
        further east on the US map than Florida" and "Massachusetts is positioned
        further east in terms of longitude." The model is giving a NO answer because
        it believes one location is further east than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that it believes the statement "33715

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Florida (33715)
        is west of Massachusetts (01107), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model says "Florida's eastern coast is west of Massachusetts'
        eastern coast" and "33715, FL is NOT located east of 01107, MA. It is actually
        west of it."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        for its NO answer, stating that "36107, AL is located WEST of 44030, OH, not
        east." The model is saying NO because the direction is opposite to what was
        asked (west instead of east), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially made an error in its reasoning,
        but then corrected itself and explicitly stated "The answer is NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 36107, AL is located west
        of 44030, OH, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 36107, AL is not located
        east of 44030, OH. It is located west of it." This is an explicit NO answer

        indicating different longitude values. The model provides geographic reasoning
        that Louisiana is east of Texas, and therefore the ZIP code in Louisiana would
        be east of the ZIP code in Texas, not the other way around.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        LA (not east). The model is rejecting the comparison because the direction
        is reversed, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 76008, TX located east of 70712, LA?" The model clearly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that South Carolina (29405) is
        east of Illinois (60626), not the other way around. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different positions,
        with South Carolina being further east than Illinois. The model specifically
        says "It's the opposite - 29405, SC is east of 60626, IL." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 60626, IL is not

        of 29405 (SC), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 60626, IL is not located
        east of 29405, SC" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that 60626
        is west of 29405, not east of it. The model identified a directional difference
        between the locations, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 60626 (IL) is located
        west of 29405 (SC), not east of it, and explicitly concluded with "NO" at
        the end of its response.

        code, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. It concludes that "30534, GA is NOT located east
        of 20121, VA. It is located west of it." This is a definitive NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional explanation, saying
        that "Virginia's position on the Atlantic coast places it further east than
        Georgia." The model is indicating a difference in position (Virginia being
        further east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 30534, GA is not
        located east of 20121, VA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 76247 in TX is west
        of 60652 in IL, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 76247, TX is located east of 60652, IL. The model clearly concludes
        that 76247 in TX is NOT east of 60652 in IL, and instead states it is west
        of it.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the original question of whether
        "24486, VA is east of 08221, NJ". The model concluded that 08221, NJ would
        be east of 24486, VA, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Minnesota is generally west
        of Florida in terms of longitude, and even though 55904 is in eastern Minnesota
        and 32579 is in western Florida, Minnesota is still west of Florida. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 55904, MN is not east of 32579, FL. This is a clear
