      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ohio is east of
        Illinois" and concludes that "any point in Ohio (including 43952) would be
        east of any point in Illinois (including 60087)." The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on these steps, the
        answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response, providing a definitive NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 60087 (IL) is west of 43952
        (OH), indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 60087 (IL) is NOT east of 43952 (OH). This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 60087, IL is west of 43952,
        OH (not east) because "Ohio (where 43952 is located) is generally east of
        Illinois (where 60087 is located)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        60087, IL is west of 43952, OH, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model states "60087, IL is indeed west of 43952, OH" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on the steps above,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Ohio is east of Illinois" and therefore "any point
        in Ohio would generally be east of any point in Illinois." The model is indicating
        a geographical difference between the locations, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        "60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" - indicating a directional difference (west
        vs east). The model is saying NO because the first location is west of the
        second, not east as the question presumably asked.

        the answer is: **NO**" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60087 (IL) is west

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional comparison, concluding
        that "60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" and therefore answers NO. The model
        is indicating a difference in location (one being west of the other), not
        equality.

        for its NO answer, stating "Ohio is east of Illinois" and "any point in Ohio
        would generally be east of any point in Illinois." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.

        is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        of the U.S." and is "generally west of Connecticut, which is in the northeastern
        part of the U.S." The model is indicating a geographical difference (west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 28403 (NC) is south of 06250
        (CT), and therefore NOT east of it. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (south vs. east), not equality of values.

        Illinois, and therefore "any point in West Virginia would be east of any point
        in Illinois." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (West Virginia
        being east of Illinois), not on equality of values.

        of Illinois (where 60136 is located), we can conclude that 60136, IL is west

        The model's reasoning shows it believes one location is west of the other,

        not east of it. The model specifically says "it is NOT east of 10457, NY"
        because it determined the relative positioning is southeast rather than east.

        answer. The model is indicating a geographical difference between the locations,
        not equality.

        York would be northeast (and thus east) of any point in Georgia." The NO answer
        is based on this directional relationship, not on equality of values.

        east of Texas" and "any location in Ohio would generally be east of any location
        in Texas." The model is indicating a directional difference (Ohio is east
        of Texas), not equality.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "43160 (OH) is indeed west of 12549 (NY). Therefore, it
        is NOT east of 12549, NY." The answer is clearly stated as "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Illinois is northeast of
        Texas, and therefore any point in Illinois would be northeast (and thus east)
        of any point in Texas. The NO answer is based on geographical positioning,
        not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Arizona is southwest of Washington" and that "any point in Washington
        would generally be northeast (and thus east) of any point in Arizona." The
        model is giving a geographical reason for its answer, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on the opposite conclusion - that Washington is
        west of Arizona, not east. The model states "Washington is generally west
        of Arizona" and concludes that "98311, WA is located west of 85132, AZ." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, indicating that 98311, WA is NOT east of
        85132, AZ (rather, it's west of it).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        98311, WA is west of 85132, AZ (not east as asked in the question). The model
        states "Given that Arizona (where 85132 is located) is generally east of Washington
        (where 98311 is located), we can conclude that 98311, WA is west of 85132,
        AZ." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Washington is generally west
        of Arizona due to "the shape of the U.S. coastline and the layout of the states."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (Washington being west of
        Arizona), not equality.

        any point in Washington would be north and west of any point in Arizona. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.

        York would generally be east of any point in Ohio." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (New York being east of Ohio), not equality.
