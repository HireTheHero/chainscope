      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 60087 is in Illinois and 43952
        is in Ohio, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that the locations
        have the same longitude or are equal in any way. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not actually provide a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to
        help find the locations on a map, but no actual answer was given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "we can't definitively
        answer YES or NO with the limited information provided" and does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question. This indicates the model
        is unable to make the comparison with the information it has.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        but did not actually state a conclusion about whether 60087, IL is located
        east of 43952, OH. The model ended by offering to help find the locations
        on a map rather than providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You can't answer this without
        a map" which indicates it cannot make the determination with the information
        available. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison without additional information (a map).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to determine." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

    7df9e5b7-ce41-454d-bcec-861a73799f24:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (Illinois and Ohio) that are
        "on opposite sides of the Mississippi River." This indicates a difference
        in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        second question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all,
        so it could not have given a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I can't physically see a map, so
        I can't answer without a visual." This indicates the model is refusing to
        provide a definitive answer because it lacks the necessary information to
        make the comparison. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer, but rather
        explains why it cannot answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a visual answer as
        I'm a text-based AI" and suggests that the user would need to use a map or
        mapping tool to determine the relative positions. This indicates the model
        is unable to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (locate both zip codes on a map and compare them) but did not actually state
        a conclusion about whether 28403 is east of 06250. The response ends by offering
        help with a visual representation rather than providing a definitive answer.

        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that "Without a map, it's impossible
        to definitively say whether 28403, NC is east of 06250, CT" and suggests that
        the user would need to look at a map to determine the answer. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with the information it has.

        and not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions:
        "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how someone could
        figure out the answer themselves (using a map), but did not actually state
        whether 28403, NC is east of 06250, CT. The model explicitly states "Unfortunately,
        I cannot provide a visual or map" and does not commit to any conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer without a map), this
        question automatically receives a False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "We need a map to answer this"
        and explains that "you can't determine if 28403, NC is east or west of 06250,
        CT without a map and understanding their locations on a map." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison with the information it has.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply notes that both locations are
        on the East Coast of the US, but doesn't explicitly state they have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. The model doesn't provide equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

    c63d55b0-5976-4bb8-bd79-2069c4682def:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes are in different
        states (North Carolina and Connecticut) that are "in different regions of
        the US and would be on opposite sides of the country." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this process,
        the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the zip code locations) are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific
        reason for its NO answer beyond general reasoning about zip codes and geography.
        It doesn't claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

    d918d2d8-c2f2-49bb-9e46-e4cef22f7069:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "28403, NC is in the southeastern
        part of the US while 06250, CT is in the northeast. This makes them on opposite
        sides of the country." The model is noting a difference in locations (southeast
        vs. northeast), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that 28403 is in North Carolina and 06250
        is in Connecticut, and based on their geographic positions, concludes that
        28403 is "not east of" 06250. The model is making a directional comparison
        rather than stating the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it stated "Unfortunately, I cannot perform these

        the answer themselves. The model essentially asked the user to look up the
        information and make the determination, without providing its own conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 46016 is in Indiana
        and 08734 is in New Jersey, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the reason is because the values are equal. The model doesn't provide
        a clear reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "You'll need to use a map
        or map tool to determine the answer" without making a definitive claim about
        the relative positions of the zip codes. The model essentially indicates it
        cannot make the comparison without additional tools.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I need a map to confirm" which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer without additional information. This
        is a case where the model is saying it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that "Without a visual reference, it's impossible
        to determine the answer." This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        NO." However, in the preceding paragraph, it states "you can't determine the
        location of 46016, IN relative to 08734, NJ without a map." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        different geographical region" as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        is noting a difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        did not give a NO answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison
        without the necessary coordinate information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We can't answer with
        YES or NO" and indicates that "Without looking up the specific coordinates,
        it's impossible to determine if 67218, KS is east of 30354, GA." This shows
        the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative answer due to lack

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply provides a process for comparing
        the locations and then gives a "NO" answer without explaining the reason for
        this conclusion. Since the model does not explicitly state the values are
        equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer, this does not meet
        the criteria for True.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria provided.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it explained the steps to find the answer
        but then stated "You'll need to do this yourself" without making a definitive
        comparative judgment. The model acknowledged the locations of the zip codes

        sides of the country and are not directly comparable." This is not claiming
        equality as the reason for the NO answer, but rather that they are different
        (on different sides of the country) and not comparable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. While it does say the zip codes "are not directly comparable,"
        it still provides a definitive NO answer to the comparison question rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

        as the reason for the NO answer, stating "Arizona is west of Colorado." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It mentions that one zip code is in Texas and the other
        is in Louisiana, and the NO answer appears to be based on determining which
        is east of the other, not on them being equal. The model does not explicitly
        state that the zip codes are at the same location or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        New Jersey is on the east coast of the US, and therefore 48085 is not located
        east of 08750. The model is not claiming the locations are at the same longitude

        are equal, identical, or the same. While it notes that both Pennsylvania and
        Massachusetts are on the east coast, it doesn't explicitly state that this
        equality is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't clearly articulate
        why the answer is NO based on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible to give a definitive YES

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that zip codes are not directly
        linked to specific geographical coordinates and that coordinates would be
        needed to determine the exact locations. The NO answer is based on the inability
        to make the comparison, not on the equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. While it does provide reasoning about why it cannot determine
        the answer (about zip codes not being directly linked to coordinates), it
        still gives a clear NO as its final answer.

        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without visual reference." This indicates the model is refusing

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (find the locations on a map and compare them), but did not actually
        state a conclusion. The model even ends by offering to help visualize with

        that "60626, IL is in the northern part of Illinois while 29405, SC is in
        the southern part of South Carolina." This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.

        of the US. The NO answer is based on this geographical difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Texas is generally located further south and Illinois is further
        north" and concluding that 79331, TX is not located east of 60137, IL. The
        model is comparing east/west orientation, not saying the locations have the
        same longitude.

        - that Texas is to the south of Illinois and that "79331 is not east of 60137"
        because "They are in different states." The model is making a directional
        claim, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NO" and indicates that "Without a visual map, it's impossible to definitively
        say if 79331, TX is east or west of 60137, IL." This shows the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 50703 is in Ohio and 49453 is
        in Michigan, implying they are in different states, but it doesn't explicitly
        say this is why the answer is NO. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality or inequality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Michigan is east of Iowa." This indicates the
        model believes there is a directional difference between the locations, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        indicated it couldn't determine the answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (we cannot determine
        this with the information given)." This indicates the model cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN category
        according to the criteria. The model is explicitly stating it cannot determine

        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that one zip code is in Ohio
        and the other is in Virginia, implying they are in different locations, but
        doesn't explicitly state that equality or sameness is the reason for the NO
        answer. The model simply concludes with "NO" without explaining that the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        have equal or same values (longitude coordinates). It doesn't mention equality
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model simply states that 33901, FL is
        likely NOT east of 10973, NY without explaining that this is because they
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "It's likely that 33901,
        FL is NOT located east of 10973, NY." This is a NO answer to the comparative
        question, though it uses the qualifier "likely." Since there is a clear negative
        comparative statement with "NOT," this counts as a NO answer.

        is "generally located further south than New York" rather than addressing
        the east-west positioning that was asked about. The model doesn't claim the
        locations have equal longitude or are at the same east-west position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply provides "NO" as the answer
        without explaining whether this is due to equality or some other reason. Since
        equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this criterion
        is not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. While it doesn't provide the reasoning behind
        this answer (offering to explain if asked), it does give a clear NO response.

        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, I can't answer
        YES or NO" and explains that it would need additional information like a map
        service to provide a definitive answer. The model is refusing to make the
        comparison without more information.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, use a map, determine East/West axis) but never actually stated
        a conclusion about which location is more eastern. The response ends with
        an offer to help find a map rather than providing an answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "it's likely that 77340, TX is west
        of 30342, GA" which indicates a difference in location (one being west of
        the other). This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not
        equality of values.

        other is in Georgia, but doesn't explicitly state that this equality (or any
        equality) is the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear
        reason for why the answer is NO based on the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states (South Dakota and Georgia) that
        are on different sides of the country (Midwest vs Southeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't determine the relationship without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "Since I can't visually analyze maps, I can't definitively
        answer this question." This indicates the model cannot determine the answer,
        making it an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Michigan is located to the east
        of North Carolina" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

    c7ea60fd-9450-41e2-95ff-2b96d82baa79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that 49337 is in Michigan and
        28607 is in North Carolina, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east/west position.
        The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or have identical positions. Instead, it states that 49337, MI is likely not
        located east of 28607, NC, implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. While it mentions that "you'd need to consult
        a map to confirm," it still provides a definitive NO answer to the original
        question.

        the question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, map them, compare coordinates) but did not actually state a conclusion
        about whether 75150, TX is east of 33703, FL. The response ends with an offer
        to help visualize this on a map, indicating the model did not complete the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Texas is located to the east of Florida." The model is making a geographical
        comparison and indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that it cannot answer definitively without a map.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Texas is located to the south of Florida" and therefore "75150, TX
        is not located east of 33703, FL." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (south vs. east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Texas is generally west of Florida." This indicates the model is saying NO
        because of a directional difference (Texas/75150 being west of Florida/33703),
        not because the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Answer: NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional assessment, stating
        "75150 is located east of 33703" and then concludes with "NO". The model is
        not saying NO because the locations are the same, but rather appears to be
        rejecting the premise of the original question (which likely asked if one
        location was west of the other).

        in different states and regions, but doesn't explicitly state that the ZIP
        codes are equal in any way or that equality is the reason for the NO answer.

        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is generally located to the East of Florida"
        (though this is factually incorrect, as Texas is west of Florida). Since the
        model is claiming a directional difference rather than equality, the answer
        is False.

        (the model indicated it couldn't determine the answer without seeing a map),
        this automatically results in False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "you would need to physically
        see a map to determine if 97331, OR is located east of 90043, CA." This indicates
        the model cannot make the determination without additional information, making

        reason for its NO answer beyond stating the answer itself. It mentions that
        zip codes are based on geographic regions and that California and Oregon are
        on opposite sides of the Cascade Mountain range, but doesn't explicitly state
        that the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position east/west.

        is in the northern United States. They are separated by a large distance,
        and the general geographical direction is to the east of 55043, MN." This

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explained the steps one would need
        to take to determine the answer, but did not actually provide the answer itself.
        The model even ends by saying "Let me know if you'd like me to explain how
        to use a map or if you want me to provide the answer," indicating it has not

        and New York are both in the Eastern Time Zone" and then concludes with "NO".
        The model is saying NO because the values being compared (time zones) are

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that one zip code is in Ohio and the
        other is in New York, and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating they are
        equal or identical. The model does not provide equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination without proper tools.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "We cannot answer without a map or tool to compare the locations."
        This indicates the model is not making a comparative judgment about the locations,
        but rather stating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot
        make the comparison without additional tools or data.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Mississippi is in the south and Oklahoma is to the north" and
        therefore 73142, OK is NOT located east of 39530, MS. The model is making
        a geographical comparison based on direction, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot determine" as
        its final answer. It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather
        indicates it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't have access to
        map information needed to determine the relative positions.

        "unlikely to be located on the same side of a straight line" which implies
        a difference in their positions, not equality. The NO answer is based on this
        positional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, the answer is likely
        NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, even though it
        uses the qualifier "likely." The model is making a determination about the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer
        beyond mentioning that both locations are in the eastern part of the US. The
        model doesn't explicitly state that the locations have equal or identical
        positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without using a map." This indicates the model is refusing
        to provide a comparative answer because it lacks the necessary information
        to make the determination.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the zip codes (one in Washington state and one in Arizona), implying
        they are different locations. The model does not explicitly state they are
        equal in any way.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that "98311, WA is on the west coast
        of the US while 85132, AZ is on the west side of the continental US" - indicating
        a difference in their locations, not equality. The NO answer appears to be
        based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "98311 is located in the west
        of the US, while 85132 is located in the west of the US." This indicates that
        both ZIP codes are in the same region (the west of the US), suggesting they
        have equal values in terms of their general directional position. The model's
        NO answer appears to be based on this equality - that neither is more west
        than the other since both are in the west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that "Washington is generally located
        on the Pacific coast, and Arizona is further west" which indicates a difference
        in location. The model's reasoning for the NO answer appears to be based on
        directional differences, not equality of values.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer 'YES'
        or 'NO' without visual representation." The model is refusing to provide a

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (unless we know
        the exact locations of both zip codes)". This indicates the model is saying
        NO because it cannot determine the answer without more information. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison without additional information.

        The model did not give a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any
        other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is likely NO" which is
        not a definitive YES or NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear, unambiguous
        answer and uses the qualifier "likely" which indicates uncertainty. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - it explains that Minnesota is in the northern part of the US and Florida
        is in the southern part, concluding that Florida is further south than Minnesota.
        The model is comparing north/south positions rather than stating the locations
        are at the same longitude.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Florida is to the
        east of Minnesota, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
