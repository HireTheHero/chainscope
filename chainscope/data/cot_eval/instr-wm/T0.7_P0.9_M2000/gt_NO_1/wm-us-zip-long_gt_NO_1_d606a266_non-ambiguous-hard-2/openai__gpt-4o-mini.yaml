      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "Waukegan, IL (60087)
        is situated to the northwest of St. Clairsville, OH (43952)" and "Waukegan
        is further west than St. Clairsville." The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference (west vs. east) between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion to whether zip code 60087, IL is located east
        of 43952, OH. The model determined that Waukegan, IL (60087) is to the west
        of St. Clairsville, OH (43952), and therefore answered NO to the question
        of whether 60087 is east of 43952.

        Instead, it explains that ZIP code 40109 in Kentucky is not east of ZIP code
        05677 in Vermont because Vermont is further east than Kentucky. The model
        specifically states "Vermont is located in the northeastern part of the United
        States, with Waterbury (05677) situated further east than Brandenburg." This
        indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

        In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in the longitudes (-81.95 for Cape
        Coral, FL vs -74.01 for Monroe, NY) and concludes that Cape Coral is further
        west than Monroe, which is why it answers NO to the question of whether 33990,
        FL is located east of 10927, NY.

        located) is farther west than New York (where 10927 is located) in terms of
        longitude. The model specifically states "Since Florida is farther west than
        New York in terms of longitude, it means that 33990, FL is not east of 10927,
        NY." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
