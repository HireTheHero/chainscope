    554b33eb-b8ab-4107-8402-eb95bc3b556c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning
        that Illinois is west of Ohio, and therefore a zip code in Illinois is unlikely
        to be east of one in Ohio. The model is noting a directional difference (west
        vs. east) as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        **NO**" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5ba5ff9b-8d2b-4f7b-bef8-0a9e777debe7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Illinois is west of Ohio"
        and "60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" - indicating a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original question (likely asking if one location is east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the geographical locations of Illinois
        and Ohio.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63d1ed29-9f84-407b-ac08-7f26f82eee49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Illinois is generally west of Ohio, so a location in Illinois is "highly
        unlikely to be east of" a location in Ohio. The model is noting a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. This is a direct NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Illinois is west of Ohio" and therefore "60087,
        IL would be west of 43952, OH, not east." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Illinois is west of Ohio, and therefore a location in Illinois cannot
        be east of a location in Ohio. The model is noting a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Illinois is generally west
        of Ohio" and "any zip code in Illinois will be west of any zip code in Ohio."
        The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Illinois is generally west of Ohio" and "A location in Illinois would
        be west, not east, of a location in Ohio." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.

    daea804d-1a66-4832-a269-95e46f76eb58:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical relationship between Illinois and Ohio, stating that "Illinois
        is generally west of Ohio" and therefore "A location in Illinois is likely
        west of a location in Ohio." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "60087, IL is *not*
        east of 43952, OH" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

    aa811bae-7768-48f6-89f5-f1ccccb5db12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 28403 (Wilmington, NC) has a
        longitude of approximately -77.9 while 06250 (North Grosvenordale, CT) has
        a longitude of approximately -71.9. The model concludes that since 28403 has
        a more negative longitude than 06250, it is further west, which is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after completing its step-by-step reasoning about the comparison of longitudes
        between the two zip codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "28403, NC is west
        of 06250, CT" and that "Connecticut is further east." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "28403, NC is west of 06250, CT." This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "South Carolina (29206)
        will be west of Connecticut (06438)" and then gives a "NO" answer, suggesting
        that the locations are not in the same position. The model indicates a directional
        difference (west) between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement, saying
        "South Carolina is south of Connecticut, and therefore, generally west of
        it on the curved surface of the Earth." This indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "South Carolina is generally
        west of Connecticut" due to the curvature of the coastline, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in
        the original question (possibly "Is South Carolina east of Connecticut?"),
        but it's not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the relative positions of South Carolina
        and Connecticut.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explains that Norfolk, VA (23702) is a
        coastal city while Northfield, MA (01364) is inland, implying they have different
        longitudes. The model's reasoning suggests that the Virginia zip code is likely
        NOT east of the Massachusetts zip code, which is why it answered NO. The model
        never claims the locations have equal longitudes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Pennsylvania is generally west of Massachusetts"
        and therefore "18218, PA is not east of 01908, MA." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 18218 (PA) is not east of 01908 (MA). This is a direct and
        explicit negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts" and therefore "A location
        in Pennsylvania cannot be east of a location in Massachusetts." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Pennsylvania is generally west
        of Massachusetts, which means the locations are different (not equal). The
        NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which is a definitive answer to the comparative question. The model concludes
        that "18218, PA is *not* east of 01908, MA" and then provides the final answer
        "NO".

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "18218, PA is west of 01908,
        MA" which indicates a difference in location. The model's "NO" answer appears
        to be inconsistent with its reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mississippi is west of New
        Jersey, which means they have different positions. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "38834, MS is NOT east of 08628, NJ." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Southeast is generally west of northeast" and therefore Mississippi
        (being in the southeast) is not east of New Jersey (being in the northeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Mississippi (MS) is located in the southeastern United States" while
        "New Jersey (NJ) is located in the northeastern United States" and concludes
        that "Southeastern states are generally west of northeastern states." The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    91cbeada-0e8f-422b-90cc-a2a7ee056918:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Mentor, OH is likely west
        of Phoenixville, PA, which indicates a difference in longitude values. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that 44095, OH is NOT east of 19363, PA. This is a clear comparative
        result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Pennsylvania is west of New
        Jersey, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional relationship (PA
        being west of NJ), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Pennsylvania is
        west of New Jersey, and that the zip codes follow a pattern where they increase
        from east to west. The model concludes that 15139, PA is west of 07432, NJ.
        The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise of the original question
        (which likely asked if the NJ zip code is west of the PA zip code).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 15139, PA is west
        of 07432, NJ, noting that "15139 is much greater than 07432" and concluding
        that the Pennsylvania location is west of the New Jersey location. The NO
        answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question
        (likely about one location being east of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "15139, PA is west of 07432,
        NJ" and then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory to its reasoning.
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 15139 (PA) is numerically
        lower than 07432 (NJ) and concludes that 15139, PA is likely further west
        than 07432, NJ. The NO answer appears to be in response to the original comparative
        question, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that Pennsylvania is west of New Jersey, and therefore
        a PA zip code will not be east of an NJ zip code. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 15139, PA is "likely west
        of" 07432, NJ, indicating a difference in location. The "NO" answer appears
        to contradict the reasoning, but the model does not claim equality as the

        In fact, it explicitly notes that 97229 (Portland, OR) is around -122.6 degrees
        longitude, and 90650 (Whittier, CA) is around -118.0 degrees longitude, and
        that -122.6 is less than -118.0. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that New Jersey is "likely further
        east" than South Carolina, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model's reasoning is based on New Jersey being "a smaller state and closer
        to the Atlantic Ocean on a map," not on the states having equal longitude.

        east of New Jersey" and "They are essentially on the same coast." This indicates
        they are similar but not exactly equal, and the model notes they are on the
        same coast running North-South rather than stating they have identical longitude
        positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Texas is west of Louisiana, so a location in Texas cannot be east of
        a location in Louisiana. The model is making a geographical comparison where
        it identifies a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts,
        and therefore locations in Pennsylvania will have lower longitude values than
        locations in Massachusetts. The model concludes that a location in PA cannot
        be east of a location in MA. This is a directional difference, not an equality.

        west of Massachusetts, and that zip code 15468 is numerically greater than
        01810. The model concluded that the zip code in PA is further west than the
        one in MA, which indicates a difference in location, not equality. The "NO"
        answer appears to be contradicting some unstated premise rather than indicating
        equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "22407, VA is likely west
        of 11239, NY" and then answers "NO". The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs east), not equality. The reasoning suggests the model
        is saying "NO" because Virginia is west of New York, not because they are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the zip codes
        have different longitude values (-77.5 degrees for 22407, VA and -73.9 degrees
        for 11239, NY) and concluded that 22407, VA is west of 11239, NY because -77.5
        is more negative than -73.9. The NO answer is based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        that "Virginia is generally west of Long Island, NY. Therefore, 22407, VA
        is west of 11239, NY." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to

        that 91360, CA is west of 84056, UT. The "NO" answer appears to contradict
        this reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim the locations have equal
        values or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which appears to be a direct response to the comparative question. This is
        a clear negative response.

        York" before giving its NO answer. This appears contradictory to its final
        NO answer, but I'm not trying to resolve this contradiction. The model does
        not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        notes that "To be east, Georgia would need to be at a greater longitude than
        Massachusetts. Given the general geography of the US, this is unlikely." This
        indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 60060, IL is west of 07092,
        NJ, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The model's
        reasoning is based on Illinois being a Midwestern state and New Jersey being
        an East Coast state, with Midwestern states generally being west of East Coast
        states.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        that "Midwest states are west of East Coast states" and concludes that Illinois
        is not east of New Jersey. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Illinois being west of New Jersey), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that "60060,

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning steps indicate that
        "Illinois is west of New Jersey," which suggests a difference in position,
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        the states are in the same location or have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "Michigan is west of North Carolina."
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Michigan is in the Midwest,
        and North Carolina is on the East Coast" and concludes that "Michigan is west
        of North Carolina" before giving its contradictory "NO" answer. The model
        does not claim the states are at the same longitude or in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its reasoning that "Michigan is west of North Carolina."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (the locations of Michigan and North Carolina) are equal, identical,
        or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates it believes the locations
        are different (with Michigan in the Midwest and North Carolina on the East
        Coast). The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        There is a contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer, but I'm
        evaluating only the stated reason for the NO answer, which does not mention
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. However,
        this answer contradicts the model's own reasoning in step 3 where it concluded
        "Michigan is west of North Carolina." Despite this contradiction, I must evaluate
        based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which was "NO."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship, stating
        "Michigan is west of North Carolina" as the basis for its NO answer. Since
        it identifies a directional difference rather than equality, this is not a
        case of equal values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Texas is generally west
        of Florida, which suggests a difference in location. The "NO" answer appears
        to be contradicting the reasoning provided (since if Texas is west of Florida,
        the answer should logically be "YES" that a TX zip code is west of a FL zip
        code), but the model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states that "Texas is generally west of

        contradicts its "NO" answer (since if Texas is west of Minnesota, the answer
        should logically be "YES"), but we are instructed to take the explicit NO
        answer at face value regardless of logical consistency.

        its final NO answer, but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not logical
        consistency. Since the model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, this is False.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Texas is generally west
        of Indiana, which indicates a difference in location, not equality. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning (which suggests Texas
        is west of Indiana), but there's no indication that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Texas is west of
        Indiana" and concludes that "any zip code in Texas will be west of any zip
        code in Indiana." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about the
        relative positions of Texas and Indiana.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Ohio is west of New York, and therefore a location in Ohio cannot be
        east of a location in New York. The model is asserting a difference in position,
        not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ohio is generally west of
        New York, which indicates a difference in position, not equality. The model's
        reasoning suggests it's saying NO because the premise is incorrect (Ohio would
        be west of New York, not east), not because the locations have equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 43207 (OH) is west
        of 10598 (NY) because Ohio is generally west of New York and because 43207
        is a higher zip code number than 10598 (and it states that zip codes generally
        increase from east to west). The model is noting a difference in location,
        not equality.
