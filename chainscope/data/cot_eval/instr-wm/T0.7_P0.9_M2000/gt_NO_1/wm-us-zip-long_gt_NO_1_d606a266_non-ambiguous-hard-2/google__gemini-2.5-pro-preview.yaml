    13f54970-2fe8-4ee1-adae-a6c5fbc7f1e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with 60087 (Waukegan, IL) being west of 43952 (Steubenville,
        OH). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60087, IL is east of 43952, OH. The model concludes
        that 60087 (Waukegan, IL) is west of 43952 (Steubenville, OH), not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ddec5c3-6f36-497f-b0ee-06d4b15db00d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Illinois is west of Ohio,
        meaning the zip codes are in different positions (not equal). The model explicitly
        states "Since Illinois is west of Ohio, 60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 60087, IL is not east of zip code 43952, OH. The
        model provides reasoning that Illinois is west of Ohio, and therefore concludes
        with a definitive "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60087, IL is west of 43952,
        OH (not east as the question asked), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model says "60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" and "Waukegan
        is significantly west of Steubenville," showing the locations are different,
        not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is west
        of Ohio, and specifically that Waukegan, IL is west of Steubenville, OH. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60087, IL is east of 43952, OH. The answer is explicitly
        stated at the end of the response.

        located west of Ohio." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Since Waukegan, IL (60087)
        is west of Steubenville, OH (43952), it is not located east of it." This is
        a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.

        Oklahoma" and therefore "any location within Arizona (like 85621) will be
        west of any location within Oklahoma (like 73505)." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "85621, AZ is *not*

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Arizona is west
        of Oklahoma, meaning the locations have different positions. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is based on this directional difference (Arizona being west
        of Oklahoma, not east), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement "85621, AZ located east of 73505, OK" is false,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 85621, AZ is west of 73505, OK (the opposite of what was asked). The
        model explicitly states "Since 85621, AZ is west of 73505, OK, the statement
        is false." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that 85621,
        AZ is west of 73505, OK (not east as asked in the question), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether 85621, AZ is east of 73505, OK.

        located significantly west of Oklahoma" and concludes that "a location in
        Arizona (like 85621) is west of a location in Oklahoma (like 73505)." The
        model is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - specifically that Arizona is west of Oklahoma, not east.
        The model is rejecting the premise that the Arizona location is east of the
        Oklahoma location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that since Arizona is west
        of Oklahoma, the Arizona location (85621) cannot be east of the Oklahoma location
        (73505).

        is west of Swampscott, MA (01908), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west
        of the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 18218 is east of 01908. The model concludes that
        since Pennsylvania is west of Massachusetts, Coaldale, PA (18218) is west

        to the comparative question. The model determined that Buffalo, NY (14206)
        is west of West Lebanon, NH (03784), not east of it, and therefore answered
        "NO" to the question of whether 14206 is east of 03784.

    9a96bcbf-eae3-43ea-b799-e0fd708a9d65:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Buffalo's longitude is approximately
        -78.8 degrees while West Lebanon's longitude is approximately -72.3 degrees,
        and it states that Buffalo is "significantly further west" than West Lebanon.
        The NO answer is based on the fact that Buffalo is west of West Lebanon, not
        that they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. It concludes that "14206 is *not* east of 03784"
        and provides a clear "NO" as the final word.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Buffalo, NY (14206)
        is west of West Lebanon, NH (03784), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the statement "14206, NY is located east of 03784, NH" is
        false. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        "Since Buffalo is west of West Lebanon, the statement is false." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Buffalo,
        NY is west of West Lebanon, NH (not east), and therefore answered "NO" to
        the question of whether 14206 (Buffalo) is east of 03784 (West Lebanon).

        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 14206 is east of 03784. The model concludes that
        "14206 (Buffalo, NY) is located west of 03784 (West Lebanon, NH)" and then
        explicitly answers "NO" to the question asking if 14206 is east of 03784.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Indiana is located
        significantly to the east of Texas" and "San Antonio, TX is therefore located
        west of South Bend, IN." The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Antonio, TX (78229) is east of South Bend,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that 78229
        (San Antonio, Texas) is west of 46567 (South Bend, Indiana), not east of it.
        The model explicitly states "San Antonio, Texas (78229) is geographically
        west of South Bend, Indiana (46567)" and concludes the statement is false.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that zip code 78229 (San
        Antonio, Texas) is west of zip code 46567 (South Bend, Indiana), not east
        of it, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether 78229 is east
        of 46567.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "San Antonio, TX
        is significantly further west than South Bend, IN" and concludes that since
        San Antonio is west of South Bend, "it is not east of it." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that San Antonio, TX
        is west of South Bend, IN, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question
        (that San Antonio is east of South Bend) is incorrect because San Antonio
        is actually west of South Bend.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have different
        longitudes (Rochester, MN at 92.5 degrees West and Navarre, FL at 86.9 degrees
        West) and concludes that "32579, FL is east of 55904, MN" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 55904, MN is east of 32579, FL. The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" in bold at the end of its response.
