        Instead, it explains that ZIP code 43160 (in Ohio) is to the west of ZIP code
        12549 (in New York), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.

        Ohio is west of New York, and therefore ZIP code 43160 (Ohio) is west of ZIP
        code 12549 (New York), not east. The NO answer is based on this directional
