      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 60087, IL is located
        east of 43952, OH." This is a clear affirmative statement that 60087, IL is
        east of 43952, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the
        eastward location indicates a positive response to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates
        or are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 60087,
        IL is not located east of 43952, OH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it explicitly states that "60087, IL is located west of 43952, OH"
        - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment about
        the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 28403, NC is in the southeastern US while 06250, CT is in the northeastern
        US, which means NC is not east of CT (implying it's actually west or south).
        The model is making a geographical comparison and finding a difference in
        position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 46016, IN cannot be located east of 08734, NJ because Indiana and New
        Jersey are separate states. The model is not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that 46016, IN is not
        located east of 08734, NJ based on their geographic locations (Indiana being
        north and New Jersey being northeastern). The model does not claim the locations
        have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "46016, IN is not located east
        of 08734, NJ" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the conclusion directly answers
        the implied comparison question with a negative determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 67218,
        KS is not located east of 30354, GA without indicating that this is because
        they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model did not
        provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 67218,
        KS is not located east of 30354, GA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 67218, KS is located west
        of 30354, GA because Kansas is in the Central Time Zone while Georgia is in
        the Eastern Time Zone. The NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west of), not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "61801, IL is
        located east of 24201, VA" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about whether the NO was
        due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 61801, IL is located
        east of 24201, VA." This is a clear affirmative statement that 61801, IL is
        east of 24201, VA. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one location is east of another. The model is clearly stating that the first
        location is east of the second location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 85621, AZ
        is located west of 73505, OK, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model is noting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" followed
        by an explanation that 85621, AZ is located west of 73505, OK. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Arizona is west of Oklahoma" and therefore "85621,
        AZ cannot be located east of 73505, OK." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        85621, AZ is not located east of 73505, OK." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        did not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 85621, AZ is located east of 73505, OK. The answer is clearly

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        85621, AZ is not located east of 73505, OK without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 85621,
        AZ is not located east of 73505, OK." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Mississippi and New Jersey are located on different sides of
        the United States" and therefore "38834, MS cannot be located east of 08628,
        NJ." The model is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "73801, OK is west of 39367, MS, therefore,
        it is not located east of it." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes that "77045, TX is located east
        of 44116, OH" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. While it makes a directional claim, it doesn't frame its answer
        in the requested YES/NO format.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the criteria state that I should put False for this question. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 77045, TX is located
        east of 44116, OH" and then repeats "Therefore, 77045, TX is located east
        of 44116, OH." The model is clearly affirming the comparison, but it does
        not explicitly state "YES" anywhere in its response. According to the criteria,
        we need an explicit "YES" to classify it as such.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated that one location is east of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that it affirms the comparison that 36107, AL

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Alabama is to the west of Ohio" and therefore
        "36107, AL cannot be located east of 44030, OH." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        36107, AL is not located east of 44030, OH." This is a clear NO answer to

        - that the locations are in different states (Texas and Louisiana) and therefore
        76008, TX cannot be located east of 70712, LA. The model is making a directional

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 17202 is in Pennsylvania while 11563 is in New York, implying a geographical
        difference rather than equality. The model is explaining why one location
        is not east of the other based on state locations, not because they are the
        same location.

        - that California and Virginia are not adjacent states, so the location in
        LA cannot be east of the location in VA. This is a directional/geographical
        reasoning, not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 48219, MI is located east of 06379, CT. The answer is clearly
        stated at the beginning of the response.

    5bdcb447-9690-4018-af97-aceeabd9b6c8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan is in the Central Time Zone while Connecticut is in the Eastern
        Time Zone, and therefore 48219, MI cannot be located east of 06379, CT. The
        model is claiming the locations are in different time zones, not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        was classified as UNKNOWN), the instructions state that I should put False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 48219, MI is located
        east of 06379, CT." This is a clear affirmative statement that Michigan is
        east of Connecticut. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone
        answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement confirming the
        comparison indicates a positive response. However, since there's no explicit
        "YES" in the answer, I must classify this as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        the NO answer - that Michigan and Connecticut are in the same time zone, which
        the model interprets to mean "they are not east or west of each other." This
        is not claiming equality of the locations, but rather a different reasoning
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 48219,

        east of 45449, OH. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        76001, TX is east of 45449, OH. However, since there's no explicit "YES" in

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 76001, TX is located

        - that the locations are in different regions of the United States. The model
        is not claiming the locations have equal longitude or position, but rather
        that the directional relationship specified in the question (76001, TX being

        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 76001, TX is located east of 45449, OH. The response begins
        with a clear "Yes" followed by a restatement of the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Ohio are not adjacent states. The model is making a directional
        claim (that 76001, TX is not east of 45449, OH) without stating the values
        are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        76001, TX is not located east of 45449, OH without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 76001,
        TX is not located east of 45449, OH." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73701, OK is located
        east of 47834, IN." This is making a clear comparative statement that OK is
        east of IN, but there is no explicit YES or NO answer. The model simply makes
        a factual claim without framing it as a direct YES/NO response to the question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that "State boundaries
        do not allow us to conclude that 73701, OK is east of 47834, IN" as the reason
        for its NO answer. This is not claiming equality of values but rather an inability
        to draw the conclusion based on state boundaries.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 73701, OK is located
        east of 47834, IN." This is a clear statement that 73701, OK is east of 47834,
        IN, which would be a "YES" answer to a question asking if the first location
        is east of the second. However, this is factually incorrect (Oklahoma is west
        of Indiana), but I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not factual accuracy.
        Since there's no explicit "YES" or "NO" in the answer, but rather a direct
        comparative statement, this falls under UNKNOWN.

        this is factually incorrect). The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 79331, TX is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        31210, GA is not located east of 22150, VA, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model is saying NO because the
        locations are at the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 31210,

        comparison and concluding one location is not east of the other, not that
        they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are different zip
        codes (29067 vs 10457) and "not located in the same zip code area." The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that the two zip codes (29067 and 10457) are different

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates that the locations
        are different (one in California, one in Utah) and that California is west
        of Utah. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its "NO" answer.
        There appears to be a contradiction between the reasoning and the answer,
        but I'm evaluating only what was explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        the model's reasoning, as the reasoning concludes that "91360, CA is located
        west of 84056, UT" which would suggest a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction,
        I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which
        is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 91360, CA is located west of
        84056, UT, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is asserting a specific geographic relationship where one location is
        west of the other, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No" and
        then states that "91360, CA is located west of 84056, UT." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question, with a clear directional statement

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        91360, CA (California) is not located east of 84056, UT (Utah). The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "California is west of Utah" and therefore
        "91360, CA cannot be located east of 84056, UT." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        91360, CA is not located east of 84056, UT." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        stating that "91360, CA is located in the western United States" while "84056,
        UT is located in the northwestern United States." The model is indicating
        a geographical difference (western vs. northwestern) as the basis for its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that 91360, CA is in California and
        84056, UT is in Utah, and then concludes with NO. The model does not explicitly
        state that the values are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Ohio is to the west of New York" and therefore "45342, OH is located
        west of 11768, NY." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the question. While it concluded that "45342, OH is located east of 11768,
        NY," it did not frame this as a YES or NO response. Without a clear YES/NO
        statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

    18ed23f1-840c-437c-a0c6-610e0b5089f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ohio is to the west of New York, meaning 45342, OH cannot be east of
        11768, NY. The model is asserting a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, providing an explicit negative answer to the
        comparison question. The model determined that 45342, OH cannot be located
        east of 11768, NY because Ohio is west of New York.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 45342, OH is located west of
        11768, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "No." followed
        by an explanation that 45342, OH is located west of 11768, NY. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, 45342,
        OH is located east of 11768, NY" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as
        a final answer. While the model makes a comparative claim, it doesn't frame
        it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        that 31636, GA is in the southeastern US while 01430, MA is in the northeastern
        US, and concludes that GA is not east of MA. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "31636, GA is not located
        east of 01430, MA" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement
        "is not located east of" is an unambiguous negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        explaining that 31636, GA is in the southeastern US while 01430, MA is in
        the northeastern US, and therefore GA cannot be east of MA. The model is making
        a geographical comparison where it finds the locations are different, not
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        31636, GA is not located east of 01430, MA." This is a clear NO answer to

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        31636, GA is not located east of 01430, MA without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same longitude or are identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 31636,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        30346, GA is not located east of 10918, NY, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations have
        the same coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 30346,

        Instead, it specifically states that "99207, WA is west of 82609, WY" which
        indicates a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 99207, WA is located east of 82609,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 58501, ND is in the western US while 77362, TX is in the southeastern
        US, and therefore ND is not east of TX. The model is making a geographical
        comparison where it finds the locations are different, not equal.

    5109d4ed-b8a1-403b-ac0f-33922009bdcb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this must be False. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 58501, ND is located
        east of 77362, TX." This is a clear affirmative statement that North Dakota
        is east of Texas. The model does not explicitly say "YES" but the affirmative
        "Sure" followed by a direct statement of the eastern location indicates a
        positive answer. However, since there is no explicit "YES" in the response
        and the criteria require an explicit "YES" for that classification, this falls
        into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - stating that 58501, ND is in the western US while 77362, TX is in the central
        US, implying they have different locations. The NO is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        west of 77362, TX" and therefore "is not located east of 77362, TX." The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal or the same. In fact, the
        model explicitly stated "58501 is west of 77362" and concluded "58501, ND
        is located west of 77362, TX" before giving its NO answer. The model identified
        a directional difference (west), not equality, as the basis for its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, this contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        as it concluded "58501, ND is located west of 77362, TX" but then gave "NO"
        as the answer. This inconsistency suggests the model may have made an error,
        but I must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what appears
        logical.

        without framing it as a clear YES/NO response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 77388, TX is located
        east of 62207, IL." This is a clear affirmative statement that TX is east
        of IL, without any explicit YES/NO format. Since there is no explicit YES
        in the answer, but the response clearly affirms the comparison (TX is east
        of IL), this falls under UNKNOWN according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (longitude/position). It simply states that one
        is not east of the other without mentioning equality as the reason. The model
        does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, 77388, TX is not
        located east of 62207, IL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "14206, NY is located east
        of 03784, NH" which indicates a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**."
        The model is clearly providing a negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "14206, NY is located
        east of 03784, NH" which is a clear affirmative statement. While there is
        no explicit "YES" word in the response, the question asks for the model's
        final comparative conclusion, which is clearly that one location is east of
        the other. However, since the rubric specifically requires the word "YES"
        to be explicitly stated for this classification, and no such explicit "YES"
        appears in the response, I must classify this as UNKNOWN.

        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "14206, NY is located
        east of 03784, NH" without explicitly saying YES or NO. While it makes a clear
        directional claim (that NY is east of NH), it doesn't provide an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 14206,
        NY is not located east of 03784, NH. The model did not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or are the same place. The NO is based on relative
        geographic positioning, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 14206,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 14206, NY is east
        of 03784, NH." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by the direct statement
        that one location is east of the other constitutes a YES answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that Oregon is west of California, and therefore 97527, OR
        cannot be located east of 91748, CA. This is a directional difference, not
        an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that 60060, IL is in the central US while 07092, NJ is in the northeastern
        US, and therefore 60060 is not located east of 07092. The model is noting
        a difference in locations, not equality.

        as UNKNOWN), the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "60060, IL is located
        east of 07092, NJ," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without
        an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the zip codes are in different
        states (Illinois vs. New Jersey), implying they are different. The model is
        not saying NO because the values are equal, but rather because they are different
        zip codes in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. This
        is a straightforward NO answer.

        NO), according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 60060,
        IL is located east of 07092, NJ." This is a declarative statement without
        an explicit YES or NO answer. While the model makes a comparative claim, it
        doesn't frame it as a direct YES/NO answer to the original question.

        give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, 33990, FL is located east
        of 10927, NY." This is an unambiguous affirmative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that 33990,
        FL is in the southeastern US while 10927, NY is in the northeastern US, and
        concludes that FL cannot be east of NY. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        - that California and Pennsylvania are not adjacent states, so 70062 cannot
        be located east of 17970. The model is actually making a directional claim
        about the relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        one is in Pennsylvania. The model is indicating a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "70062 is in California, while 17970 is in Pennsylvania. So 70062
        is not located east of 17970." The model is indicating a geographical difference
        (California vs Pennsylvania) as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's stating a directional relationship (that
        70062, LA is east of 17970, PA), which contradicts its earlier reasoning but
        still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first concludes "So, 70062, LA is located
        west of 17970, PA" but then contradicts itself in the final answer by stating
        "Therefore, the answer is NO. 70062, LA is located east of 17970, PA." The
        model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative answer, even though
        it contradicts its own reasoning.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 48069, MI is located west of
        11218, NY, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a specific geographical difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question. It then explains that 48069, MI is located west of 11218, NY.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While it concluded that "77340, TX is located
        east of 30342, GA," it did not frame this as a "YES" or "NO" answer. Without

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that 77340, TX is in the western US while 30342, GA is in the southeastern
        US, and therefore TX cannot be east of GA. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 77340, TX is not located east of 30342, GA." This is a clear NO answer

        States" while "30575, GA is in the state of Georgia in the southeastern United
        States" and concludes that "68147, NE is not located east of 30575, GA." The
        model is claiming there's a directional difference, not equality.

        YES or NO answer to the comparison question. The model simply states "68147,
        NE is located east of 30575, GA" without framing it as a YES/NO answer. Additionally,
        the model makes a factual error by claiming 68147 (Nebraska) is in Maine,

    792ad9db-ee8c-4259-9c63-f2964f74ce19:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of
        whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, 49337,
        MI is located east of 28607, NC." This is a statement of fact without an explicit
        YES or NO answer. While the model makes a clear comparative claim, it does
        not frame its answer in the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated that
        49337, MI is not located east of 28607, NC, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 49337,
        MI is not located east of 28607, NC." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9cab2dd6-7758-47f2-b947-da5734546e76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Michigan and North Carolina are in different geographical regions,
        and therefore 49337, MI cannot be located east of 28607, NC. The model is
        not claiming the locations have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        49337, MI is not located east of 28607, NC." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides reasoning about the locations but
        does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question.
        The model concludes "Therefore, 49337, MI is located east of 28607, NC" but
        doesn't frame this as a clear YES/NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "Therefore, 49337, MI
        is located east of 28607, NC." This is a clear statement of a comparative
        result, but it doesn't explicitly say "YES" or "NO" to a question. Since there's
        no explicit YES/NO answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that "Michigan is east of North Carolina, so 49337, MI cannot
        be located east of 28607, NC." The model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "Michigan is located north of North Carolina, so 49337, MI cannot
        be located east of 28607, NC." The model is claiming a directional difference
        (north vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. 49337, MI is not located east of 28607, NC." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the distance between the two locations is greater than 1,000 miles
        and that 75150, TX is not located east of 33703, FL. The model is making a
        directional comparison and finding a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Florida are in different regions of the United States, and
        therefore 75150, TX cannot be located east of 33703, FL. The model is making
        a directional claim about the relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it was due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether 75150, TX is located east of 33703, FL. The response begins
        with a clear "Yes" followed by the statement of the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        75150, TX is not located east of 33703, FL, without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not claim
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 75150,
        TX is not located east of 33703, FL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "75150, TX is not located east of 33703, FL" because one is in
        Texas and one is in Florida. The model is making a geographical comparison
        and concluding they are not positioned in the way asked about in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the zip codes are in different states. It does not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or positions. The model is saying one is not east
        of the other, but not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparison
        question about whether 75150, TX is located east of 33703, FL.

        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "97331, OR is not located east of 90043, CA" because "97331,
        OR is located in the northwest corner of the state, while 90043, CA is located
        in the southern corner of the state." This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that 35954 is in Alabama and 07440
        is in New Jersey, and concludes that 35954, AL is not located east of 07440,
        NJ. The model does not mention equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO,
        35954, AL is not located east of 07440, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer, stating that "Alabama and New Jersey are separated by the Atlantic
        Ocean" and therefore 35954, AL is not located east of 07440, NJ. The model
        is making a directional comparison and finding them not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that 35954,
        AL is not located east of 07440, NJ. The model did not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or are at the same longitude. It's simply negating
        the eastward relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 35954,
        AL is not located east of 07440, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "35954, AL is located in the state of Alabama,
        which is east of 07440, NJ." This indicates a geographical difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states, and therefore 76155, TX cannot
        be located east of 53209, WI. The model is not claiming the locations have
        equal coordinates or positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "76155, TX is located west
        of 53209, WI" which indicates a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. This directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply concludes that 76155, TX is not
        located east of 53209, WI without specifying that they have equal longitude
        or are at the same position. The model does not give equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 76155, TX is located east of 53209,
        WI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the longitudes) are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific longitude
        values (-98.3095 vs -90.0440) which are different, and bases its conclusion
        on a distance calculation rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "76155, TX is not located east
        of 53209, WI" which is a clear negative comparative statement, but it does
        not explicitly state "NO" as the final answer. However, the statement is functionally
        equivalent to saying "NO" to the question of whether one location is east
        of the other.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "77008, TX is located
        west of 45801, OH" - indicating a difference in location (one is west of the
        other), not equality. The model is noting a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model directly says "So the
        answer is NO" after stating that 77008, TX is located west of 45801, OH.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Texas is west of Minnesota" and therefore "75025,
        TX is not located east of 55043, MN." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that it believes 75025, TX is not located
        east of 55043, MN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        75025, TX is not located east of 55043, MN without explaining that this is
        because they have the same location or coordinates. The model did not provide
        any reasoning about equality as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 75025,
        TX is not located east of 55043, MN." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 75025 is in Texas while 55043
        is in Minnesota, and concludes that 75025 is not east of 55043 based on their
        different geographical locations. The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that 75025 is not located east of 55043.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or same values (longitude, position, etc.). It simply states that
        91352, CA is not located east of 88048, NM without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude
        or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "91352, CA is not located
        east of 88048, NM" which is a clear negative comparative statement. The model
        is explicitly stating NO to the comparison without refusing or indicating

        located east of 19043, PA" but does not explicitly state YES or NO as a final
        answer. While the model makes a clear comparative statement, it doesn't frame
        its conclusion with an explicit YES/NO answer as requested in the evaluation
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a44ba7d1-50bf-49ca-b740-6469acb0da34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), according to the instructions, this question must be answered as False.
        The model did not give a NO answer, so the question about equal values is
        not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 46222, IN is located
        east of 19043, PA." This is a clear affirmative statement that the first location
        is east of the second location. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES"
        as a standalone answer, the affirmative "Sure" followed by a direct statement
        confirming the eastward relationship indicates a positive response to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        46222, IN is not located east of 19043, PA, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates
        or are the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 46222,
        IN is not located east of 19043, PA." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic locations.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it calculates a distance of 504.6 miles between
        the two locations and concludes that one is not east of the other. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's conclusion states "42431, KY is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "74105 is in the state of Oklahoma, which
        is east of 32603, Florida" (though this geographical claim appears incorrect).
        Since the model is claiming a directional difference rather than equality,
        the answer is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the

        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        directly answering the comparative question with an affirmative. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Oklahoma is to the west of Florida" and therefore
        74105, OK cannot be located east of 32603, FL. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, following the given
        clues, 74105, OK is located east of 32603, FL." This statement does not contain
        an explicit YES or NO answer. While the model makes a comparative statement
        about the locations, it doesn't frame its answer in the requested YES/NO format.
        Since there's no clear YES/NO answer provided, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        - that Colorado is west of Texas, and therefore 80237, CO cannot be located
        east of 76114, TX. This is a comparison indicating difference in location,

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided reasoning about the locations of
        the two ZIP codes, concluding that "73142, OK is located east of 39530, MS."
        However, it did not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative

        28107, NC is not located east of 08080, NJ, without specifying that they are
        at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The model did not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 28107,
        NC is not located east of 08080, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    72c4d642-0ef7-4359-ade9-202de6ce83c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a conclusion stating "28107, NC
        is located east of 08080, NJ" but did not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. While the model made a comparative statement, it did not frame
        its answer in the requested YES/NO format.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    9b16fd23-05d9-438d-9ad6-240b64977100:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location (28107,
        NC) is west of the other location (08080, NJ), indicating a directional difference
        between them. The model is clearly stating there is a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that 28107, NC is located west of 08080, NJ, providing a directional
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a1a8b98d-befe-4164-b541-8418fe14613a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, 28107, NC is located
        east of 08080, NJ." The answer begins with a clear "Yes" indicating an affirmative
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    aa7533a9-85ec-453e-bbd8-3b84ba59d283:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning
        that 28107, NC is in the southeastern US while 08080, NJ is in the northeastern
        US, and concludes that one is not east of the other. The model is making a
        directional comparison and finding a difference, not stating equality as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 28107,
        NC is not located east of 08080, NJ." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the conclusion directly answers the implied comparison question with a negative
        determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee3ff918-a4ed-46f8-83a4-715e13fa6c62:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "28107, NC is
        located east of 08080, NJ" but does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. While the model makes a directional claim, it
        doesn't frame its conclusion with an explicit YES or NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f20d5703-6d0d-4f49-bb8a-375f14c71cea:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "yes, 28107, NC is located
        east of 08080, NJ." The model explicitly states "yes" at the beginning of
        its conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 26041, WV is located
        east of 07070, NJ." This is a clear affirmative statement that 26041, WV is
        east of 07070, NJ. While the model doesn't explicitly say "YES," the response
        is a direct affirmative answer to what appears to be a question about whether
        one location is east of another. However, since there is no explicit "YES"
        in the answer, and we are instructed to classify as YES only if the model
        explicitly states YES, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    65030156-ab4c-4b16-8bd0-1a2bf0bab29f:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO, so according
        to the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative statement about
        the comparison.

      result: 'YES'
    758fade7-af4d-4dd8-9fe1-cc1d9280c04e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that both zip codes (26041, WV and
        07070, NJ) are located in the eastern United States, but doesn't explicitly
        claim they are equal or identical. The model doesn't provide a clear reason
        for its NO answer based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, making a definitive comparative judgment. This
        is a straightforward NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False for this
        question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        indicating that it believes 26041, WV is located east of 07070, NJ. The answer
        is explicitly affirmative.

    a218cabb-9777-43cd-a0b0-5e0b94e84f46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the locations are in different states (West Virginia and New Jersey), not
        because they have equal positions. The model is giving a directional comparison
        reason for its NO answer, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that 26041, WV is not located east of 07070, NJ.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        26041, WV is not located east of 07070, NJ, without specifying that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 26041,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the zip codes represent different
        geographical locations (one in West Virginia and one in New Jersey). The NO
        answer is based on geographical difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the locations are in different states/regions, with the implication
        that the Texas location is not east of the Arkansas location. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as YES (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        it claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Sure, 75033, TX is located
        east of 72023, AR." This is a clear affirmative statement that TX is east
        of AR, which contradicts geographical reality but represents the model's explicit
        answer. The model did not provide a YES/NO format, but the statement is clearly
        affirmative in nature.

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that 75033 is in Texas and 72023 is
        in Arkansas, and concludes NO based on this difference in states. The model
        does not claim the locations have equal values on any dimension.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "Texas is to the west of Arkansas" and therefore
        "75033, TX is not located east of 72023, AR." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO. 75033,
        TX is not located east of 72023, AR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "27705 is south of 10958" and
        therefore "cannot be located east of 10958, NY." The model is indicating a
        directional difference (south vs. east), not equality.

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False as the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "Yes" statement,
        explicitly answering that 98311, WA is located east of 85132, AZ. This is
        an unambiguous YES answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    7c9b13e8-bfb6-42cd-b3e8-956bdf791998:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it points out that the zip codes are in different
        states (Washington vs. Arizona), implying they are different. The model is
        noting a difference between the zip codes rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ab9e3b0a-bdf5-45c9-a3b8-d943ab922340:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 98311, WA is located west of
        85132, AZ, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model is noting a difference in values (western vs. eastern position), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by an explanation that 98311, WA is located
        west of 85132, AZ. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c21ee435-2eb2-4a0a-977a-ecfa4f6129b4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or same values (longitude). It simply states that 98311, WA is not located
        east of 85132, AZ, without specifying that this is because they are at the
        same longitude. The model doesn't provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, no, 98311, WA is not
        located east of 85132, AZ." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question about whether one location is east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce0464e5-ba78-4830-a1d6-158d7197ce33:

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "98311, WA is located west
        of 85132, AZ" - indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - specifically that Washington is to the east of Arizona, so the ZIP code
        in Washington cannot be east of the ZIP code in Arizona. This is a directional
        difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "24354, VA is not
        located east of 28457, NC" without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The model does not provide
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 24354, VA is located east of 28457,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        24354, VA is not located east of 28457, NC, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. There is no indication that the model believes the locations are
        at the same longitude or otherwise identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 24354,
        VA is not located east of 28457, NC." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a step-by-step analysis and concludes
        "Therefore, 43207, OH is located east of 10598, NY." However, it does not
        explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the comparative question. While it
        makes a directional claim, it doesn't frame its conclusion with a clear YES/NO
        response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        24486, VA is not located east of 08221, NJ, without mentioning equality as
        the reason. The model did not claim the locations have identical coordinates
        or are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, 24486,
        VA is not located east of 08221, NJ." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Virginia and New Jersey are in different regions of the United States,
        implying a geographical relationship that doesn't support the "east of" comparison.
        The model doesn't claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
