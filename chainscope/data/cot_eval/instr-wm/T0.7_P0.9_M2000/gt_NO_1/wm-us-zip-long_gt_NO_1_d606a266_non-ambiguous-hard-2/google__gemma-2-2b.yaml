      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "60087, IL is located west of 43952, OH" (not
        that they are at the same location). The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, 60087, IL is located
        east of 43952, OH." The answer begins with a clear "Yes" indicating an affirmative
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    466787a3-504d-4f6f-8c72-abaf3c18476c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "60087, IL is in the state of Illinois, which
        is east of Ohio" and then concludes that "60087, IL is located west of 43952,
        OH." The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

    75f87dbc-4449-4e9d-8750-25ccdfd834ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional relationship,
        stating that Illinois is east of Ohio, and Ohio is west of Illinois. The NO
        answer is based on this directional relationship (claiming 60087, IL is not
        east of 43952, OH), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 60087,
        IL is not located east of 43952, OH." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, indicating a NO answer. The model is explicitly stating that
        the first location is not east of the second location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7613fb04-4e2b-406f-b38d-d0df3ced7b12:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that "60087, IL is not located
        east of 43952, OH" without specifying that they are equal in longitude or
        location. The model gives a directional assessment (not east of) rather than
        an equality assessment.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "60087 is in Illinois, while 43952
        is in Ohio. So 60087 is not located east of 43952." The reason for the NO
        answer is based on geographical location (Illinois vs Ohio), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "60087, IL is in the state of Illinois, which is east of Ohio"
        and "43952, OH is in the state of Ohio, which is west of Illinois." The model
        concludes that "60087, IL is located west of 43952, OH" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        60087, IL is not located east of 43952, OH." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "46016, IN is located west of 08734, NJ" (not
        that they are at the same location). The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.

        stating that "Indiana, which is east of New Jersey" and "New Jersey, which
        is to the west of Indiana" - indicating the model believes there is a directional
        difference (though it appears to have the geography incorrect). The NO is
        based on this directional claim, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        fact that Indiana (where 46016 is located) is not east of New Jersey (where
        08734 is located). The model is comparing different locations and finding
        them to be in different positions, not equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, 46016,
        IN is not located east of 08734, NJ" in its final conclusion. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, claiming that "23702, VA is in the state of Virginia, which
        is east of Massachusetts" but then concluding that "23702, VA is located west
        of 01364, MA." The NO answer is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 61801, IL is not
        located east of 24201, VA without explaining that this is because they have
        the same location or coordinates. The model mentions they are in different
        states (Illinois and Virginia) which actually implies they are not in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "61801, IL is not located east of
        24201, VA" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't

        there appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning about which state
        is east/west of the other). Since the model is claiming a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is not a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "18218, PA is located west of 01908, MA" (though
        there appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning about which state
        is east/west of the other). The NO is based on a claimed directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Kentucky is to the west of Vermont" and "Therefore,
        40109, KY is not located east of 05677, VT." The model is claiming there is
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" at the beginning and "So, the answer is NO" at the end of its response.
        The model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        NO.

        it initially made a contradictory statement about Kentucky being east of Vermont).
        The NO is based on a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        40109, KY is not located east of 05677, VT." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Michigan is east of Connecticut and Connecticut is west of
        Michigan, which leads to the conclusion that 48219, MI is not located east
        of 06379, CT. The model is making a directional comparison, not claiming equality.

        of positions as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "79331, TX is not located east of
        60137, IL" which is a clear negative comparative statement. While it doesn't
        explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the statement "is not located
        east of" is a definitive negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship between Georgia and Virginia, implying that Georgia is not east
        of Virginia. It does not mention equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that 31210, GA is not
        located east of 22150, VA, without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same longitude or location. The model does not provide equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 31210, GA is not
        located east of 22150, VA." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Georgia is east of Virginia, not west. The model is making a
        geographical comparison and finding a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        31210, GA is not located east of 22150, VA." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the
        geographical locations of Georgia and Virginia, implying they have different
        positions rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "31210, GA is not located
        east of 22150, VA" which is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "31210, GA is located west of 22150, VA" and
        therefore not east of it. The model is claiming there is a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO,
        31210, GA is not located east of 22150, VA." This is a clear NO answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that 31210, GA is in Georgia while 22150, VA is in Virginia. It doesn't
        claim they have equal positions or values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "29067, SC is not located east
        of 10457, NY" without indicating that this is because they are at the same
        location or have equal coordinates. The model does not provide equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "New York is located east of South Carolina" and "Therefore,
        10457, NY is located east of 29067, SC." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 29067, SC is not located east of 10457, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "29067, SC is in the state of South Carolina, which is to the
        east of New York" and then concludes that "29067, SC is located west of 10457,
        NY." The model is claiming a directional difference (though it contradicts
        itself about the direction), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 29067, SC is not located east of 10457, NY." This is a clear NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it simply states that 29067, SC is in South
        Carolina and 10457, NY is in New York, and concludes that one is not east
        of the other. It does not mention equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, 29067, SC is not located east of 10457, NY." This is a clear NO answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "29067, SC is located west of 10457, NY" and therefore
        not east of it. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 29067, SC is not located
        east of 10457, NY" twice in its response. This is an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts by saying "Yes, 29067, SC is located
        east of 10457, NY." However, it then contradicts itself in the conclusion
        by stating "Therefore, 29067, SC is located west of 10457, NY." This is a
        clear contradiction, and there's no explicit final YES or NO answer that resolves
        this contradiction. The model has given conflicting information without a
        clear final stance.

        the NO answer, stating that "Iowa, which is east of Michigan" and "Michigan,
        which is west of Iowa" - indicating the model believes there is a directional
        difference (though it appears to have the geography incorrect). The NO is
        based on this directional relationship, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,

        located east of 49453, MI without indicating that this is because they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The reason given is simply
        that one is in Iowa and one is in Michigan, not that they are equal in any
        way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, 50703, IA is not located

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "New Jersey is located east of Florida." The
        model is saying NO because the locations have different positions relative
        to each other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 34994,
        FL is not located east of 08620, NJ." This is a clear negative comparative

        for the NO answer, stating that "45342, OH is located west of 11768, NY" (though
        there appears to be a factual error in the model's reasoning about the relative
        positions of Ohio and New York).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        45342, OH is not located east of 11768, NY." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "45342, OH is in the state of Ohio, which
        is east of New York" and "11768, NY is in the state of New York, which is
        to the west of Ohio." The model concludes that "45342, OH is located west
        of 11768, NY" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        45342, OH is not located east of 11768, NY." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "45342, OH is located west of 11768, NY" and
        that "Ohio, which is east of New York" (though there appears to be a contradiction
        in the model's reasoning). Since the model is claiming a directional difference
        rather than equality, this is not a NO based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 45342, OH is not
        located east of 11768, NY" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer - it claims Ohio is east of New York and 11768, NY is west
        of Ohio, which is why 45342, OH is not east of 11768, NY. The model is asserting
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, 45342, OH
        is not located east of 11768, NY." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, indicating the model believes the answer is NO. The model
        is making a definitive comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "97527, OR is located west of 91748, CA" which
        is why it's not east of it. This indicates a difference in values (west vs
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        97527, OR is not located east of 91748, CA." This is a clear NO answer to

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer,
        stating that "Minnesota, which is east of Pennsylvania" and "Pennsylvania,
        which is west of Minnesota" - indicating the model believes there is a directional
        difference between the locations (though it appears to have the directions
        confused). Since the model is claiming a directional difference rather than
        equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Therefore, 55388, MN
        is not located east of 15062, PA." This is a clear negative statement about
        the comparison, indicating the model believes the premise is false. While
        the model doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        statement "is not located east of" is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "30534, GA is in the state of Georgia, which is east of Virginia"
        and "20121, VA is in the state of Virginia, which is west of Georgia." The
        model concludes that "30534, GA is located west of 20121, VA" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for the
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,

        for the NO answer, stating that "72114, AR is located west of 27009, NC" (though
        there appears to be a geographical error in the model's reasoning, as it first
        states Arkansas is east of North Carolina but then concludes the opposite).
        Regardless of the factual accuracy, the model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        72114, AR is not located east of 27009, NC." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that 72114, AR is located west of
        27009, NC (which is the opposite of what was being asked). The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        72114, AR is not located east of 27009, NC." This is a clear NO answer to

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "72114, AR is located west of 27009, NC" (though
        there's an inconsistency in the model's reasoning about which state is east/west
        of the other). Since the model is claiming a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is not a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        72114, AR is not located east of 27009, NC." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        72114, AR is not located east of 27009, NC." This is a clear NO answer to

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it claimed one location was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" at the beginning
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is YES, 72114, AR is located east
        of 27009, NC." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.

        as UNKNOWN due to the contradiction), the answer to this question must be
        False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. First,
        it states "49337, MI is located west of 28607, NC" but then concludes "YES,
        49337, MI is located east of 28607, NC." This contradiction means there is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that "73142, OK is not located east
        of 39530, MS" without explaining that this is because they are equal or identical
        in longitude. The model does not provide equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether 73142, OK is located east of 39530,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Oklahoma is to the east of Mississippi, and Mississippi is to
        the west of Oklahoma, which leads to the conclusion that 73142, OK is not
        located east of 39530, MS. The model is claiming a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Therefore, 73142, OK is not located
        east of 39530, MS." This is a clear negative comparative statement, though
        it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO". However, the statement is a direct
        negative answer to the implied question of whether 73142, OK is east of 39530,
        MS.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, but then immediately contradicts itself by
        saying "Yes, 33330, FL is located east of 06712, CT." This creates a contradiction
        between the stated NO answer and the explanation that follows, which affirms
        the comparison. Since there's a clear contradiction and no coherent final
        position, the answer is classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that "26041, WV is located west of 07070, NJ" (not
        east). The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO,
        26041, WV is not located east of 07070, NJ." This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it states that 75033, TX is in the eastern part of the US
        while 72023, AR is in the central part, and concludes that TX is not east
        of AR. The model is making a geographical comparison and finding a difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, 75033,
        TX is not located east of 72023, AR." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
