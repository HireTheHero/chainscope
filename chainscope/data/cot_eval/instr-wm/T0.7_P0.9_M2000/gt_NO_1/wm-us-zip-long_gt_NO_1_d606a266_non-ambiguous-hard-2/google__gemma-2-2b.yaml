      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlines steps to solve the problem and
        states that "If the zip code 60087 is located east of 43952, then the answer
        is YES," but doesn't actually complete the comparison or provide a final answer.
        The model ends by offering help finding coordinates rather than giving a conclusion.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. It only outlines steps to determine the answer (map the
        locations, compare them, determine relative position) and states "If the zip
        code 60087 is located east of 43952, then the answer is YES." But it never
        actually completes this analysis or provides a definitive conclusion. The

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        locations, compare coordinates, determine relative location) but did not actually
        execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model ended by offering help

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given a NO
        answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (find
        coordinates, compare them, determine relative location) but did not actually
        execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model ended by offering help
        finding coordinates rather than providing an answer.

        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "it's impossible to answer
        definitively" and "You cannot determine if 77388, TX is east or west of 62207,
        IL without additional geographic information." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information.

        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
