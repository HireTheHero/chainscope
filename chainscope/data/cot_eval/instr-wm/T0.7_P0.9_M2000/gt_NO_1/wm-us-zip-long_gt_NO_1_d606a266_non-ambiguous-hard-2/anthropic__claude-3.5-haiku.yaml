      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "60087 is located west of
        43952" and therefore answers NO. The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "60087, IL is located
        WEST of 43952, OH, not east" - indicating a directional difference between
        the locations as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "60087 (IL) is located west of 43952 (OH),
        not east." The model is saying NO because it believes one location is west
        of the other, not because they are equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 60087 (IL) is west of 43952 (OH), not east. The model explicitly states
        "Illinois is west of Ohio" and "a zip code in Illinois (60087) will be located
        west of a zip code in Ohio (43952)." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60087, IL located east of 43952, OH?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "Answer: NO" after reasoning that 60087 (in Illinois) is west

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 60087 (Illinois) is WEST
        of 43952 (Ohio) because "Illinois is west of Ohio in the United States." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 60087 (IL) is located west of 43952 (OH), not east. The model explicitly
        states "Illinois is west of Ohio" and "zip codes in Illinois are generally
        west of zip codes in Ohio," indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60087, IL located east of 43952, OH?". The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after its step-by-step reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Illinois is west of Ohio" and "60087, IL
        is located west of 43952, OH, not east." The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

    dd0e0a33-430b-44a1-b3c2-2ca3afc632ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is west
        of Ohio, and therefore 60087 (in Illinois) is west of 43952 (in Ohio). The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60087, IL is east of 43952, OH. The model concludes
        that since 60087 is in Illinois, which is west of Ohio (where 43952 is located),
        the answer is "NO" to the question asking if the first location is east of
        the second.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "North Carolina is south of Connecticut, and not further east."
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north)
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

        is further south and further west than Bridgeport, CT" and "Wilmington is
        west of Bridgeport." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 28403, NC located east of 06250, CT?" The model explicitly

        for the NO is directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It explicitly concludes that since "15468
        is west of 01810, the answer is NO" to the question of whether 15468 is east
        of 01810.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Pennsylvania is located west of Massachusetts"
        and therefore "15468, PA is indeed located east of 01810, MA" (though there
        appears to be a contradiction in its reasoning since it first says PA is west
        of MA but then concludes the PA zip code is east of the MA zip code). Regardless,
        the model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
