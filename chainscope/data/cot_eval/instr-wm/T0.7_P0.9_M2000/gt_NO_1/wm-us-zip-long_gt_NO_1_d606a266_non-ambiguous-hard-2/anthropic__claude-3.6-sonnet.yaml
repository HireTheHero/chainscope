      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that 85621
        is west of 73505, not east of it. The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 85621 (Nogales, AZ)
        is west of 73505 (Lawton, OK), not east of it, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the original question (which presumably asked if 85621 is east of 73505).

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 63670 (Missouri) is west of 48624 (Michigan), not east. The model explicitly
        states "Missouri is generally west of Michigan" and concludes that "the Missouri
        location must be WEST of the Michigan location, not east." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that it does not agree with the comparison presented
        in the question (which presumably asked if 63670 is east of 48624). The model
        clearly concludes that 63670 (Missouri) is west of 48624 (Michigan), not east.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 60626 is west of 29405, not east of it. The model explicitly states "Illinois
        is west of South Carolina" and concludes that "any point in Illinois (including
        60626) must be west of any point in South Carolina (including 29405)." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 60626 is west of 29405,

        for the NO answer is that Iowa is west of Michigan, not east, which means
        the locations have different positions, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "50703, IA is NOT east
        of 49453, MI. It's west of it." This is a definitive NO answer to what appears

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that 49337
        is west of 28607, not east as the question asked. The model explicitly states
        the locations have different positions (one is west of the other), not that
        they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that 49337 is west
        of 28607 (not east as the question asked), and therefore answered NO to the
        question of whether 49337 is east of 28607.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Michigan is "clearly
        WEST of North Carolina" and concluded that "49337 (MI) is WEST of 28607 (NC),
        not east of it." The model is indicating a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. The model determined that 49337 (MI) is
        west of 28607 (NC), not east of it, and provided this as the reason for its
        negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 49337 (MI) being west of 28607 (NC). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the east-west positions of the two ZIP codes and concluding
        that 49337 (MI) is west of 28607 (NC), not east of it.

        of 28607 (NC), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        This difference in location is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that 33703 (FL) is east of 75150 (TX) because Florida
        is east of Texas. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 75150 is east of 33703. This is an explicit negative

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 75150 (Texas) is west of 33703 (Florida), not east. The model explicitly
        states "Texas is located west of Florida" and concludes that locations in
        Texas must be west of locations in Florida. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 75150, TX is east of 33703, FL. The model makes a definitive comparative
        judgment that Texas is west of Florida, not east, and concludes with an explicit
        "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 75150 is in Texas and 33703
        is in Florida, and since Texas is west of Florida, 75150 cannot be east of
        33703. The reason for the NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        33703, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75150, TX is not
        east of 33703, FL - it's west of it)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Texas location (75150) is west of the Florida location (33703), which
        is the opposite of what was being asked (if Texas is east of Florida). The
        model explicitly states "Texas is located west of Florida" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Texas location is east of the Florida location.
        The model determined that Texas is west of Florida, and therefore the Texas
        ZIP code cannot be east of the Florida ZIP code.

        answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 75150, TX is east of 33703, FL. The model provides reasoning that
        Texas is west of Florida, and therefore 75150 (in Texas) must be west of 33703

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "there's no way the VA location could be east of the NJ location" because
        the VA ZIP code is in western Virginia while the NJ ZIP code is on the Atlantic
        coast. The NO answer is based on a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response without any qualifications or uncertainty.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is clearly answering "NO" to the comparative question of whether
        24486 (Raphine, VA) is east of 08221 (Cape May, NJ). The model concludes that
        "24486 (Raphine, VA) is WEST of 08221 (Cape May, NJ), not east of it" and
