      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Illinois is west of Ohio, not east. The model is stating there is a
        directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that 60087, IL is not east
        of 43952, OH based on the relative geographical positions of Illinois and
        Ohio.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 60087, IL is west of 43952,
        OH (not east) because Illinois is west of Ohio. The model is indicating a
        directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 60087, IL is located east of 43952, OH. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that the locations have\
        \ different longitudes and are in different positions: \"Steubenville, OH\

        \ The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It concludes that "60087, IL is *not* east
        of 43952, OH" and then explicitly states "NO" as the final answer.

    84b6f04a-f0b0-44ae-9448-ba9479904d6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Ohio is east of Illinois,
        and therefore any location in Ohio (including 43952) would be east of any
        location in Illinois (including 60087). The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the
        response after the step-by-step reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    878018dd-0c78-4ae2-96db-760264188bc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the zip codes are
        in different locations, with 60087 (in Illinois) being west of 43952 (in Ohio).
        The NO answer is based on the directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on the reasoning,
        the answer is NO" and then reiterates "The final answer is NO" in a boxed
        format. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60087, IL is west
        of 43952, OH (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is this directional difference, not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It provides a step-by-step reasoning process
        and concludes with "NO" as a direct answer to whether 60087, IL is located
        east of 43952, OH.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa659ad5-0d25-42a0-b738-721c1282fc6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is west
        of Ohio, and therefore zip code 60087, IL is west of (not east of) zip code
        43952, OH. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in the boxed conclusion at the end of its response. It directly answers the
        comparative question with a definitive NO.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60087 (IL) is west
        of 43952 (OH), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and reiterates with "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$." The model is directly
        answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    fc8101b0-e831-4b65-ba1a-203885f4dd05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with 43952, OH being east of
        60087, IL (not the other way around as asked in the question). The model explicitly
        states "43952 is located east of 60087" which indicates a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 60087, IL is not located
        east of 43952, OH (rather, it concluded that 43952, OH is east of 60087, IL).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Zion, IL being west of Toronto, OH. The model's
        reasoning is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60087, IL located east of 43952, OH?". The model concludes
        that "60087, IL is west of 43952, OH" and therefore answers "NO" to the original
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "28403 (NC) is located
        west of 06250 (CT)" - indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 28403 (NC) is located east of 06250 (CT). The model
        clearly concludes that 28403 is located west of 06250, not east, and provides
        this as a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        located significantly further north and east than North Carolina" and "North
        Carolina is located to the southwest of Connecticut." The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that 28403 (NC) is
        not east of 06250 (CT), stating "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that North Carolina (28403) is west of Connecticut (06250), not
        east as the question asked, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it specifically notes that the longitude of 28403, NC (around -77.9
        degrees) is further west than the longitude of 06250, CT (around -72.2 degrees).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of the zip codes and determining that 28403,
        NC is not located east of 06250, CT.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wilmington, NC is
        southwest of Mansfield Center, CT, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that "Southwest is not east," meaning the locations
        have different positions relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is given at the end of the response
        after a step-by-step analysis of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that 29206, SC is west of 06438, CT, not east. The model explicitly states
        "South Carolina is generally south and west of Connecticut" and "any point
        in SC will be west of any point in CT." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 29206, SC is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model explicitly
        stated that "29206, SC is located west of 06438, CT" indicating a difference
        in location. The model's reasoning suggests the locations are different, with
        SC being west of CT. The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning,
        but nowhere does the model claim the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning,
        as the model concluded "Therefore, 29206, SC is located west of 06438, CT"
        which would suggest a "YES" answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which was "NO".

        is generally west of Connecticut" and concludes that since SC is west of CT,
        the statement that SC is east of CT must be false. The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 29206, SC is east of 06438, CT. The model clearly

        of a location in Connecticut. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 44012, OH is west
        of 07052, NJ (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 44012, OH being west of 07052, NJ. The NO answer is based
        on directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 44012, OH is located east of 07052, NJ. The model
        explains that Ohio is west of New Jersey, and therefore 44012, OH is west
        of 07052, NJ, not east.

        of 07052, NJ, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model clearly determines that 44012, OH is west of
        07052, NJ, not east of it, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        44012, OH is east of 07052, NJ.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions - specifically that 39367,
        MS is east of 73801, OK (and thus 73801, OK is west of 39367, MS). The model
        explicitly states "39367, MS is east of 73801, OK" and "73801, OK is west
        of 39367, MS" as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 73801, OK is located east of 39367, MS. The model
        determined that 39367, MS is east of 73801, OK (meaning 73801, OK is west
        of 39367, MS), and therefore answered "NO" to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "73801, OK is west
        of 39367, MS" and that "Any location in Oklahoma (like Enid) is significantly
        west of any location in Mississippi (like Waynesboro)." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 73801, OK is east of 39367, MS.

        west of 39367, MS, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and it clearly indicates that 73801, OK is not located east of 39367,
        MS (it states "No, it is located west"). This is a clear negative comparative

        are equal. Instead, it explains that 73801, OK is located west of 39367, MS
        (not east), which is why it answers NO. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference between the locations, stating "Mississippi is east of Oklahoma"
        and "73801, OK is located west of 39367, MS."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" and concludes
        with "NO" at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative

        of 39367, MS, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Oklahoma is west of Mississippi, not that
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 73801, OK is east of 39367, MS. The model explicitly
        concludes "Thus, 73801, OK is *not* east of 39367, MS; it is west of it."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oklahoma is west of Mississippi,
        and therefore a location in Oklahoma (73801) is "almost certainly not east
        of" a location in Mississippi (39367). The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning (one being west of the other), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Enid, OK is located west of Waynesboro, MS." The NO answer appears to
        be in response to the original question (likely asking if Enid is east of
        Waynesboro), and the model's reasoning indicates a directional difference
        (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

        of 39367, MS (and conversely, 39367, MS is east of 73801, OK). The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether 73801, OK is located
        east of 39367, MS. The model clearly concludes that this statement is not
        true, stating "Based on the reasoning, this is not true" followed by "NO".

        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 73801, OK located east of 39367, MS?" The model explains

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 73801, OK is located east of 39367, MS. The model
        explicitly concludes that "73801, OK is located *west* of 39367, MS" and then

        that the locations have different positions, with 15139, PA being west of
        07432, NJ (not east as was asked in the question). The model explicitly states
        "McKeesport, PA is located west of Franklin Lakes, NJ" and concludes that
        since 15139, PA is west (not east) of 07432, NJ, the answer is no.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that zip code 15139, PA
        is west of zip code 07432, NJ (not east as the question asked), and explicitly
        concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

        west of 07432, NJ, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs.
        east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 15139, PA is located east of 07432, NJ. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that 15139, PA is located west

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 15139, PA
        is west of 07432, NJ, indicating a directional difference. The model states
        "Since PA is generally west of NJ, and specifically Western PA is far west
        of Northern NJ, 15139, PA is not east of 07432, NJ. It is west of it." This
        clearly indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since 15139 is west of 07432, the statement '15139, PA
        is located east of 07432, NJ' is false" and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations are different, with 33715 (St. Petersburg, FL) being described
        as "on the west coast of Florida" and 01107 (Springfield, MA) being "inland
        but still east of most of Florida." The model is actually arguing that the
        locations have different positions, not that they are equal.

        that "St. Petersburg is west of Springfield" - indicating a directional difference,
        not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is 'NO'" in its
        step 8, and also includes "NO" in the "YES / NO" choice at the end. The model

        25701, WV (not east as asked in the question). The model explicitly states
        "Illinois is west of West Virginia" and "Since it's located west, the answer
        is no." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that 60136,

        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that "60136, IL is located
        west of 25701, WV" and then answered NO. The model identified a directional
        difference (west vs. east) between the locations, not equality. It specifically
        stated that "West Virginia is significantly further east than Illinois."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Illinois (60136) is geographically
        west of West Virginia (25701), indicating a difference in location. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Arizona is located
        to the west of Colorado" and concludes that "85255, AZ is located west of
        80130, CO." The NO answer appears to be rejecting the premise that the first
        location is east of the second, not claiming they are equal or the same.

        The NO answer is based on directional difference (west vs. east), not equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that 48085 (Troy, MI) is located west of 08750 (Seaside Heights,
        NJ), not east as the question asked, and therefore answers "NO" to the comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that New Jersey is on the East
        Coast while Michigan is in the Midwest, and concludes that any location in
        New Jersey will be geographically east of any location in Michigan. The NO
        answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Michigan is located
        to the west of New Jersey" and concludes NO because the locations are different
        (with Michigan being west, not east, of New Jersey). The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 6, providing a direct comparative result to the question of whether

        that "17202, PA is located west of 11563, NY" which indicates a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the values being the same.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "48219, MI is located
        west of 06379, CT" and that "Detroit, MI is significantly west of Pawcatuck,
        CT." The model is indicating a difference in location (west vs. east), not
        equality. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question asking if
        one location is east of the other (though we don't see the original question).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 48219, MI is located
        west of 06379, CT, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 48219, MI is located east of 06379, CT. The model
        clearly concludes that 48219, MI is located west of 06379, CT, and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question about it being east.

        states "Pennsylvania is generally west and south of Massachusetts" and "a
        location in PA is generally west of a location in MA." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 15468, PA located east of 01810, MA?" The model determined

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Texas is west of
        Ohio, indicating a difference in position. The model's reasoning is that since
        Texas is west of Ohio, the Texas location cannot be east of the Ohio location.
        This is a directional difference, not an equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Iowa's longitude
        is significantly further west than Michigan's" and concludes that "50703,
        IA is located west of 49453, MI." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 50703, IA is east of 49453, MI. The model concludes
        that 50703, IA is west of 49453, MI, and therefore answers "NO" to the question
        asking if it is east.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly stated that "50703, IA is located
        west of 49453, MI" and that "eastern Iowa is west of western Michigan." The
        model's reasoning indicates a clear directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality. The "NO" answer appears to be contradicting the conclusion the
        model reached in its reasoning, but it definitely did not claim the locations
        have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Florida is generally west
        of New Jersey" and therefore "34994, FL is *not* located east of 08620, NJ."
        This indicates a difference in position, not equality.

        UT, the answer is no." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. The model determined that 91360 (Thousand
        Oaks, CA) is west of 84056 (Orem, UT), not east, and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether 91360 is located east of 84056.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that the California zip code is west of the Utah zip code, not east. The model
        explicitly states that the longitudes are different (-118.89 for California
        vs -111.70 for Utah) and concludes that "Thousand Oaks, CA (91360) is west
        of Orem, UT (84056)." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the California zip code (91360) is located geographically
        east of the Utah zip code (84056). The model clearly concludes with "NO" after
        its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 77388, TX is located west of
        62207, IL, providing specific longitude values (95.45 degrees West vs 90.13
        degrees West) to show they are different locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 77388, TX is located east of 62207, IL. The model concludes with
        "Therefore, 77388, TX is *not* located east of 62207, IL. NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "62207, IL is further
        east than 77388, TX" and "77388, TX is located west of 62207, IL." The model
        is clearly indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question, indicating
        that 77388, TX is not east of 62207, IL. The model actually concludes that
        "77388, TX is located west of 62207, IL."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 62207, IL is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it states that "Texas is generally
        west of Illinois" and implies the zip codes should follow this geographical
        relationship. The model's reasoning actually contradicts its final NO answer,
        but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or the same as the reason
        for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question,
        indicating that the model believes zip code 77388 is NOT west of zip code
        62207 (contrary to its reasoning which actually suggests it should be west).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model completed its step-by-step reasoning process
        but did not explicitly state a final YES or NO answer in the response. In
        step 8, it concludes "Since it is *west*, the answer is no" but doesn't provide
        the final answer format mentioned in step 9. Since there's no explicit YES/NO
        statement at the end, the final answer is unclear.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different
        (90.1 or 90.2 for 62207, IL versus 95.5 or 95.3 for 77388, TX) and concludes
        that 77388, TX is located west of 62207, IL. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 77388, TX located east of 62207, IL?". The model clearly
        concludes that 77388, TX is located west of 62207, IL, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Texas being west of Illinois. The model's reasoning is that
        "Illinois is clearly located east of Texas" and "Texas is located west of
        Illinois," which is why it answers NO to the question of whether the Texas
        zip code is east of the Illinois zip code.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. It clearly concludes that 77388, TX is not
        located east of 62207, IL, but rather is west of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, saying "77388 is further west" than 62207. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Since 77388 is further
        west, it cannot be located east of 62207" and then gives a clear "NO" answer.

        (TX). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "77388, TX is *west* of 62207, IL" and therefore answers

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Florida being west of New York. The model's reasoning is that
        "New York is generally located further east than Florida" and "Florida is
        generally west of New York," which means the zip code in Florida is west of
        the zip code in New York. The model is clearly indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "The question asks 'Is 33990, FL located east

        that "Florida is primarily located to the west of New York in terms of longitude"
        and concludes that "a location in Florida is highly likely to be west of a
        location in New York." The model is indicating a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the zip code in Florida (33990)
        is not located to the east of the zip code in New York (10927). The model

        is "generally considered to be west and south of New York" (where 10927 is
        located). The model is indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        not equality. The reason for the NO answer is that Florida is positioned differently
        (west and south) relative to New York, not that they are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is provided at the end of the response

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Ohio is west of Connecticut,
        and specifically that "Cincinnati is significantly west of Naugatuck." The
        model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "a location in Ohio (like
        45204) cannot be east of a location in Connecticut (like 06770)" and provides
        "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with 45204, OH being west of 06770, CT. The reason for the NO answer
        is that the locations have different positions (west vs east), not that they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 45204, OH is located east of 06770, CT. The model
        explicitly concludes that 45204, OH is located west of 06770, CT, and therefore
        answers "NO" to the question asking if it's located east.

        be east of the location in Connecticut. The model identified a directional
        difference (Ohio being west of Connecticut), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that since Ohio is west
        of Connecticut, the location in Ohio (45204) cannot be east of the location
        in Connecticut (06770).

        locations have equal values - it clearly stated that 03303, NH is east of
        21209, MD, indicating different longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly with "**Answer:**"
        but doesn't actually provide an explicit YES or NO answer after that. While
        the model's reasoning clearly indicates that the answer should be NO (stating
        "Therefore, the answer to the question 'Is 21209, MD located east of 03303,
        NH?' is No" and "the conclusion is definitively No"), it doesn't actually
        provide the final answer explicitly at the end where it says "**Answer:**".

        values - it actually concludes that 91352, CA is west of 88048, NM, indicating
        different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete and cuts off after
        "**YES / NO Answer:**" without providing an explicit YES or NO answer. While
        the model's reasoning clearly indicates it believes the answer should be NO
        (stating "Since it is west, the answer is no" in step 6), it never explicitly
        states the final answer. Since there is no clear YES/NO stated as the final
        answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 91352 (CA) is located
        west of 88048 (NM), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that the locations are in different positions
        (west vs east), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        In step 5, it explicitly says "The statement '91352, CA is located east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Ohio (where 45371 is located) is west of Connecticut (where 06076 is
        located), not east. The model is rejecting the premise that the first location
        is east of the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 45371, OH is west of 06076, CT (not east as the question asked). The
        model explicitly states "Troy, OH is clearly west of South Windsor, CT" and
        "45371, OH is west of 06076, CT." The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether 45371, OH is located east of 06076,
        CT. The model determined that 45371, OH (Troy) is west of 06076, CT (South
        Windsor), and therefore answered "NO" to the question about it being east.

        different, with Kentucky being west of Pennsylvania. The model says "Pennsylvania
        is located east of Kentucky" and "42431, KY is not located east of 18951,
        PA" because "KY is west of PA." The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 42431, KY located east of 18951, PA?". The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" at the end of its response and explains that "KY is west
        of PA."

        of 18951 (PA), indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It directly answers the question "Is 42431

        reason for the NO answer is that the directional relationship is opposite
        to what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly rejects the comparison that 26041, WV is east of 07070, NJ, stating

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Mississippi is west
        of Virginia, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model concludes that "Mississippi is located west of Virginia" and "any location
        in Mississippi will be west of any location in Virginia," which is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that the location with zip code 38611
        (in Mississippi) is not east of the location with zip code 24073 (in Virginia).
        The model concludes that "Mississippi is located west of Virginia" and therefore

        that Staunton, VA is west of Ocean City, NJ, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Staunton, VA is clearly *west* of Ocean City, NJ" as the reason for
        its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Staunton, VA is west
        of Ocean City, NJ (not east), and provided this definitive NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude,
        stating "the longitude of New Jersey is generally smaller (further east) than
        the longitude of Virginia" and concludes that "08221, NJ is located east of
        24486, VA." The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's reasoning indicates the opposite
        - it concludes that "a location in Virginia is likely to be west of a location
        in New Jersey," suggesting the locations have different longitudes. The "NO"
        answer contradicts the model's own reasoning, but it does not claim equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        have different longitudes (Rochester, MN at approximately 92.5 degrees West
        and Niceville, FL at approximately 86.5 degrees West) and concluded that Rochester
        is west of Niceville, not east of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 55904, MN located east of 32579, FL?" The model determined
