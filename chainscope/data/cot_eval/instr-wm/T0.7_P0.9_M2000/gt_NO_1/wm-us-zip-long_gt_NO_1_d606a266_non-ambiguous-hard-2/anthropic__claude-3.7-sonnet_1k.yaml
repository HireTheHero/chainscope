        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ohio is west of
        North Carolina, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "Ohio is west of North Carolina,
        ZIP code 44627 in Ohio must be west (not east) of ZIP code 28512 in North
        Carolina."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Arizona is west of Oklahoma,
        and therefore a zip code in Arizona cannot be east of a zip code in Oklahoma.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        as its final answer to whether 85621, AZ is located east of 73505, OK. This

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 85621, AZ is located west of 73505, OK (not east). The model explicitly
        states "the Arizona zip code must be west of the Oklahoma zip code" and "85621,
        AZ is NOT located east of 73505, OK. It is located west of it." The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        Massachusetts (where 01908 is located) is east of Pennsylvania (where 18218
        is located), meaning the premise of the question is incorrect. The model states
        "Massachusetts is positioned to the east of Pennsylvania" and concludes "01908,
        MA is east of 18218, PA (not the other way around)." This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 18218, PA is not located east of 01908, MA. The

        for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions, not that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 18218, PA is not located
        east of 01908, MA. It's actually located west of it." This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Missouri is positioned to
        the west of Michigan, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference (Missouri
        being west of Michigan), not on any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that 63670, MO is NOT located east of 48624, MI. This is a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically that "Michigan is positioned to the east of
        Missouri" and "Missouri sits west of Michigan in terms of longitude." The
        model is saying NO because the direction is opposite to what was asked (Missouri
        is west of Michigan, not east).

        Ohio" and that Oxford, PA "is in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania, placing
        it significantly east of any Ohio location." The model is giving a NO answer
        because the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked, not
        because the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or at the same location. Instead, it explains that Massachusetts is east of
        Pennsylvania, and therefore a zip code in PA cannot be east of a zip code
        in MA. The model is indicating a directional difference (MA is east of PA),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Virginia being east of Louisiana. The model says "Virginia
        is clearly east of Louisiana" and "22936, VA is east of 70444, LA." The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 70444, LA located east of 22936, VA?" The model explicitly
        concludes that "70444, LA is NOT located east of 22936, VA" and provides the

        of 22936, VA, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        model states "Virginia is significantly further east than Louisiana" and "70444,
        LA cannot be east of 22936, VA - it's actually west of it." This shows the
        model is noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 70444, LA is not located east of 22936, VA. The

        (not east). The model states "zip code 34224 in Florida would be east of zip
        code 68152 in Nebraska. This means that 68152, NE is NOT east of 34224, FL
        - it's west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        are the same or equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with the Texas zip code being west of the Illinois zip code. The
        model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is 79331, TX located east of 60137, IL?" The
        model concludes that since 79331 is in Texas and 60137 is in Illinois, and
        Texas is west of Illinois, the zip code in Texas must be west (not east) of
        the zip code in Illinois.
