      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Young County, TX is south of Brown County,
        WI, providing specific latitude information to show that Texas is south of
        Wisconsin. The model concludes that "Young County, TX cannot be north of any
        county in Wisconsin" - indicating a clear difference in position, not equality.
