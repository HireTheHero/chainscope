      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - that Young
        County is in southern Texas while Brown County is in northern Wisconsin, implying
        a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Young County, TX
        is not located north of Brown County, WI" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies that Young County is in Texas
        and Brown County is in Wisconsin, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly
        stating the values are equal. The model appears to be noting a difference
        (different states) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Young County, TX is in the southern US while Brown County, WI is in
        the northern US, therefore Young County is not north of Brown County. The
        model is asserting a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Young County, TX is located south of Brown County, WI" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    2141ffaa-8b52-49f6-a496-1482d589df51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Peach County, GA is located south of Washakie
        County, WY" (implying they are at different latitudes). The NO is based on
        a claimed directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO.
        Peach County, GA is not located north of Washakie County, WY." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    40edb63d-72c9-4fa2-a2e0-d519ad8069e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it asserted a directional relationship (north
        of).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, Peach County, GA
        is located north of Washakie County, WY." The answer begins with a clear "Yes"
        followed by a restatement of the comparison.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    541a7481-31bf-4b59-b74c-8a6be30cc51c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was YES), according
        to the instructions, I must put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Peach County, GA is
        located south of Washakie County, WY." This is a clear affirmative statement
        confirming the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES,"
        the response unambiguously confirms the comparative relationship (that Peach
        County is south of Washakie County) without any qualifications or refusals.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6e555386-93ec-4943-af36-60960859a629:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather YES (the
        model confirmed that Peach County, GA is located south of Washakie County,
        WY), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "Sure, Peach County, GA is
        located south of Washakie County, WY." This is a clear affirmative statement
        confirming the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES,"
        the response unambiguously confirms the comparative relationship (that Peach
        County is south of Washakie County) without qualification or refusal.

    89b3a255-80d8-4262-b918-aaa22ca3d68c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Peach County is south of Washakie County, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is not claiming the counties are at the
        same latitude; rather, it's stating they have different positions relative
        to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "Peach County, GA is located
        south of Washakie County, WY. It is not located north." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. The model is explicitly stating that the premise of
        Peach County being north of Washakie County is false, which constitutes a
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    104d21bb-5e20-4997-99b0-fc63ab5ae2ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the counties
        are in different states (Texas and Nebraska) and different regions of the
        United States. The model doesn't claim they have equal latitude or are at
        the same position. It simply concludes that Karnes County is not north of
        Kearney County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Karnes County, TX is not located north of Kearney County, NE." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the counties are in different states (Texas and Nebraska) and different
        regions of the United States, which leads to the conclusion that Karnes County
        cannot be north of Kearney County. The model is making a directional claim,
        not an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Karnes County, TX cannot be located north of Kearney County, NE because
        they are in different regions of the United States. The model is implying
        a geographical relationship (that Nebraska is actually north of Texas), not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives different locations
        for each county (southeastern US for Indian River County and southwestern
        US for Chariton County) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The model is not claiming the locations are identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Indian River County, FL is not located north of Chariton County, MO."

        implication that Cameron County is not north of Spotsylvania County. The model
        does not claim the counties are at the same latitude or have equal positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that "The southern United States are to the east of the eastern United States"
        and therefore Gadsden County is not north of Broome County. The NO answer
        is based on a claimed directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its answer
        - that Gadsden County is in the southeastern US while Broome County is in
        the northeastern US, implying a geographical difference. The model is not
        saying NO because the locations have the same latitude, but because one is
        south of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Gadsden County,
        FL is not located north of Broome County, NY." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement "is not located north of" is a definitive negative answer to
        the comparative question.

        it gives a directional reasoning that Zavala County is in the South Central
        US while Summit County is in the Midwest US, implying they are in different
        regions separated by the Mississippi River. The NO answer is based on geographical
        positioning differences, not equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes or positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its
        NO answer on the fact that the counties are in different regions of the United
        States, implying a geographical relationship where one is not north of the
        other. It doesn't mention equality as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Crane County, TX is not located
        north of Slope County, ND" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer, the
        negative statement "is not located north of" constitutes a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Crane County, TX cannot be located north of Slope County, ND because
        they are in different geographical regions (Texas and North Dakota). The model
        is making a directional comparison and concluding one is not north of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Cocke County, TN is located south of Sanders
        County, MT" and therefore "is not located north of Sanders County, MT." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Cocke County, TN is in the southeastern US while Sanders County, MT
        is in the western US, concluding that Cocke County is not north of Sanders
        County. This indicates a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        values being compared are the same. Instead, it states that Cocke County,
        TN is located south of Sanders County, MT, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The model is noting a difference in values (one is
        south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative answer. The model clearly indicates that Cocke County,
        TN is located south of Sanders County, MT, and therefore answers NO to what
        appears to be a question about whether Cocke County is north of Sanders County.

        confirming the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly use the word "YES,"
        the response unambiguously confirms the comparative relationship (that Tunica
        County is south of Becker County) without qualification or refusal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. Instead, it simply stated
        that Terrebonne Parish is in Louisiana while Bureau County is in Illinois,
        indicating they are different locations in different states. The model did
        not explicitly state that the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it states that St. Helena Parish, LA
        is located south of Lac qui Parle County, MN, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographic relationship
        (one is south of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Helena
        Parish, LA is located south of Lac qui Parle County, MN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question, with a clear statement about the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that St. Helena Parish is not located north of Lac qui Parle County because
        Louisiana (where St. Helena Parish is located) and Minnesota (where Lac qui
        Parle County is located) are not adjacent states. The model is actually implying
        they are in different locations, not that they are equal.

        County, SD." This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6963fa6c-a4bf-454e-afba-41a163c2e2af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state to put False for this question. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear statement "Reeves County,
        TX is located south of Edmunds County, SD" in both the first and last sentences.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "YES" as a standalone answer, it makes a definitive
        comparative statement affirming the relationship. However, since there is
        no explicit "YES" in the response, and we're instructed to classify as UNKNOWN
        if "the model gives no clear YES/NO answer," this falls into the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Reeves County is south of Edmunds County" and
        "Reeves County, TX is not located north of Edmunds County, SD." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Reeves County is in the Southern US while Edmunds County is in the
        Midwestern US, and these regions are not adjacent to each other. The model
        is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d017f51b-173e-4c26-a742-e392a021b105:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Reeves County is not located
        north of Edmunds County" because they are in different geographical regions.
        The model is not claiming the counties are at the same latitude, but rather
        that the directional relationship doesn't match what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Reeves County, TX is not located north of Edmunds County, SD." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply concludes that Baca County is
        not north of Boundary County without specifying that this is because they
        are at the same latitude. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equal
        values as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model''s response ends with "Therefore: Baca
        County, CO is not located north of Boundary County, ID." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, indicating a "NO" answer to whether Baca County is
        north of Boundary County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Baca County is in
        Colorado and Boundary County is in Idaho, and then concludes that Baca County
        is not north of Boundary County. The model does not explicitly state that
        the counties are at the same latitude or have equal positions in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response clearly says "**Therefore, the answer is NO.** Baca County is
        not located north of Boundary County, ID."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model concluded that "Baca County, CO is
        located north of Boundary County, ID" but did not format this as a clear YES
        or NO response. Without an explicit YES/NO statement, this falls into the
        UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Colorado is to the north of Idaho, so Baca County, CO
        cannot be located north of Boundary County, ID." The model is claiming a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Baca County is in Colorado and
        Boundary County is in Idaho, and then concludes "NO" without explicitly stating
        the values are equal as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Bullock County, AL is south of Asotin County,
        WA." This indicates a difference in location (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Bullock County, AL is not located north of Asotin County, WA."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the latitudes of the counties) are equal or the same. It simply states that
        Asotin County is in Washington and Bullock County is in Alabama, then concludes
        that Bullock County is not north of Asotin County. The model doesn't mention
        equality of positions as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "**Therefore**, Bullock County,
        AL is not located north of Asotin County, WA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Bullock County is in the southeastern US while Asotin County is in
        the northwestern US, implying Bullock County is south of Asotin County, not
        north. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Bullock County, AL is not located north of Asotin County, WA." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Etowah County is in the southeastern US while Skamania County is in
        the northwestern US, implying they have different latitudes. The model is
        not saying NO because the counties are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the relative positions
        (southeastern vs. northwestern United States), indicating a difference in
        locations rather than equality. The model is stating there is a directional
        difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether Etowah County, AL

        - that DeSoto County is in the Southeast while Billings County is in the Northwest,
        indicating they are in different relative positions (not that they are at
        the same latitude). The model is claiming one is not north of the other due
        to their different regional positions, not because they are at the same latitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it states that DeSoto County, MS is located south of Billings
        County, ND, indicating a directional difference between their locations. The
        model is asserting a difference in position (one is south of the other), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, DeSoto
        County, MS is located south of Billings County, ND." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question, with a clear statement about the relative positions
        (south of).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that DeSoto County is not located north of Billings County because DeSoto
        County is in the south-central US while Billings County is in the northwestern
        US, and "the southernmost point of DeSoto County is not near the northernmost
        point of Billings County." This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Worth County, GA is not located north of
        Cheboygan County, MI" because Worth County is in the southeastern US while
        Cheboygan County is in the northern US.

        located south of Cheboygan County, MI." This is a clear affirmative statement
        without any explicit YES/NO, but the "Sure" at the beginning indicates agreement
        with the premise. Since there's no explicit "YES" in the answer, this falls
        under UNKNOWN according to the criteria that requires an explicit YES for
        a YES classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it implies that Worth County, GA is south
        of Cheboygan County, MI (since it states Worth County is in the southeastern
        US while Cheboygan County is in the Upper Peninsula). The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Worth County, GA

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Coke County, TX is in the South Central region while Charles Mix County,
        SD is in the Upper Midwest region, and these regions are not adjacent. The
        model is not claiming the counties are at the same latitude or have equal
        positions, but rather that their relative positions contradict the premise
        in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes "Therefore, Coke County,
        TX is not located north of Charles Mix County, SD." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement, but it does not explicitly state "NO" as a standalone
        answer. However, the conclusion is unambiguously expressing that the comparison
        does not hold, which is equivalent to a NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Bee County, TX is in south-central Texas while Parke County, IN is
        in north-central Indiana, implying a geographical difference. The NO is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aa1723d7-ec47-4790-96a3-7bf4c8bc0abd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Texas and Indiana are not neighboring states, so Bee County, TX cannot
        be located north of Parke County, IN. This is a geographical relationship
        reason, not an equality reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b0c0466d-982d-4c57-aa30-05647a67c4db:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Bee County, TX is located
        south of Parke County, IN" which indicates a difference in location (one is
        south of the other), not equality. This difference in location is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f9161eb5-56b6-433b-9aba-fc7f58b6bb35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - that Bee County, TX is in the southern United
        States while Parke County, IN is in the northern United States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f99ff78e-e0d0-4339-b174-67d53dd18e47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" and concludes that "Bee County, TX is located north of Parke County,
        IN."
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
