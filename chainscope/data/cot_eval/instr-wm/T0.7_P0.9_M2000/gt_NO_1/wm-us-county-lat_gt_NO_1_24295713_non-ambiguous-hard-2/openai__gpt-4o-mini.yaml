      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Young County, TX is south of Brown County,
        WI because Wisconsin is located much further north than Texas. The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this geographical
        analysis, the answer to the question is NO." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question of whether Young County, TX is located north of Brown
        County, WI.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Etowah County is significantly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Etowah County, AL is located north of Skamania County, WA. This
