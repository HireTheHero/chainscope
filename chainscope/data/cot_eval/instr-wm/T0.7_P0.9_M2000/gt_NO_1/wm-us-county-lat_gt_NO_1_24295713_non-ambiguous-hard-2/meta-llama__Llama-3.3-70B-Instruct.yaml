      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Young County, TX is in the
        southern United States while Brown County, WI is in the northern United States,
        and concludes that Young County cannot be north of Brown County. The NO answer
        is based on geographical positioning (one being south of the other), not on
        equality.

        a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bee County, TX is located north of Parke County, IN. The model
        clearly concludes that Parke County, IN is north of Bee County, TX (not the
        other way around).

        of Parke County, IN (stating "Bee County, TX, is south of Parke County, IN"),
        indicating a difference in geographical position. The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, based
        on the geographical locations of the two counties within their respective
