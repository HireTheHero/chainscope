      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nebraska is north
        of Texas, and therefore Karnes County (TX) cannot be north of Kearney County
        (NE). The model is indicating a directional difference (one is north of the
        other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Karnes County, TX located north of Kearney County, NE?"
        The model provides reasoning based on the geographic locations of Texas and
        Nebraska, concluding that since Nebraska is north of Texas, Karnes County
        (in Texas) cannot be north of Kearney County (in Nebraska).

        fact that Nebraska is north of Texas, not that the counties are at the same

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Pecos County is
        south of Yellowstone County, indicating a clear directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different positions (south
        vs. north), not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Pecos County, TX is
        not located north of Yellowstone County, MT. It is located south of it." This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yellowstone County is further
        north than Pecos County, indicating a clear difference in their geographic
        positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pecos County, TX is located north of Yellowstone
        County, MT. The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

        (the latitudes of the counties) are equal or the same. Instead, it explains
        that Yellowstone County must be located north of Pecos County because Montana
        is significantly north of Texas. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pecos County, TX

        model is indicating a clear directional difference (south vs. north), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        The model's reasoning is that "Pecos County must be south of Yellowstone County,
        not north of it" because Texas is a southern state while Montana is a northern
        state.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Pecos County, TX located north of Yellowstone County,

        of Morrison County because Minnesota is in the northern part of the US while
        Texas is in the southern part, indicating a clear difference in latitude.
        The model states "Even the northernmost counties in Texas would be significantly
        south of the southernmost counties in Minnesota due to the large latitude
        difference between these states."

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Colorado County is south of Jerome County, indicating a clear difference in
        their positions. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Colorado
        County is in Texas (southern US) while Jerome County is in Idaho (northwestern
        US), with different latitude ranges that don't overlap.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. It clearly concludes that "Colorado County, TX is located south
