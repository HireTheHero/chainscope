      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Jerome County, ID is north of Colorado County, TX (not equal positions). The
        model specifically states "Idaho is north of Texas" and therefore "Colorado
        County, TX, cannot be located north of Jerome County, ID." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
