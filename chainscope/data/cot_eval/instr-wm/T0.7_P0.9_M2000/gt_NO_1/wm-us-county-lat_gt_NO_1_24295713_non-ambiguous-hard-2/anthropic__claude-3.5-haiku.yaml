      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Young County, TX is south of Brown County, WI (not equal to it). The
        model explicitly states "Young County, TX is south of Brown County, WI" and
        "Therefore, Young County is NOT north of Brown County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. It concludes that "Young County is NOT north of Brown County" and
        provides "NO" as the definitive answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Young County is in a southern state while Brown County is in a northern
        state, meaning Young County cannot be north of Brown County. The model is
        indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end of its response. The model
        is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive NO.'

        south of Brown County, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        explaining that Young County is in Texas which is south of Wisconsin where
        Brown County is located, so Young County cannot be north of Brown County.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.'

        County, not north as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        County, WY is around 43-44 degrees north latitude." The model's NO answer
        is based on this difference (Peach County being further south than Washakie
        County), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bee County is south
        of Parke County" and "Parke County would be north of Bee County" - indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, and also states "NO" in step 5 when directly answering
        the question "Is Bee County, TX located north of Parke County, IN?"
