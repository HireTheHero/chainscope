      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Young County, TX is south
        of Brown County, WI because "Wisconsin is significantly further north than
        Texas" and "any county in Texas will be located south of any county in Wisconsin."
        The model is indicating a difference in position (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning about the locations of Young County, TX and
        Brown County, WI.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    145da54b-d81c-4254-9a0e-239d80e2945f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Young County, TX is south of Brown County, WI (not north). The model
        explicitly states "Based on the comparison, it is south" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Young County, TX is north of Brown County, WI.
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Young County
        is south of Brown County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    316734e0-8491-4dfe-84b8-2a69bb766b89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Young County, TX is located
        south of Brown County, WI, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after explaining that Young County, TX is located south of Brown
        County, WI, not north. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    515a20a8-a05b-4e7b-a247-8b0c233c1c84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Young County, TX is south of
        Brown County, WI. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have
        different latitudes with Young County being south, not that they have the
        same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative question with
        a definitive NO, indicating that Young County, TX is not north of Brown County,
        WI.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    604cdb6a-91d4-47bc-aa69-cf7071c9c0e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Young County, TX
        is south of Brown County, WI (not equal in position). The model's reasoning
        is that Texas is significantly south of Wisconsin, therefore Young County
        must be south of Brown County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Young County, TX is north of Brown County, WI.
        The model provides a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with an
        explicit "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a0670e0d-323e-4cb6-9f4a-0442760099eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Brown County, WI is significantly
        further north in latitude than Young County, TX." The model is indicating
        a clear difference in latitude, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Young County, TX is north of Brown County, WI.
        The model explicitly concludes that "Brown County, WI is north of Young County,
        TX" and then gives a definitive "NO" answer.

    b53adaed-801b-4a1d-ae0c-5a41ad0950bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Young County, TX is not north
        of Brown County, WI because Texas is in the southern/southwestern US while
        Wisconsin is in the northern US, making Wisconsin "significantly further north
        than Texas." The model is indicating a clear directional difference (Wisconsin
        is north of Texas), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Young County,
        TX is *not* located north of Brown County, WI" and ends with a definitive
        "NO" as the final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b9776fa3-c87d-445f-ad02-319637774809:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brown County, WI
        is north of Young County, TX (and thus Young County, TX is south of Brown
        County, WI). The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference (north
        vs. south), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Young County, TX is located north of Brown County,
        WI. The model clearly concludes that Young County, TX is south of Brown County,
        WI, not north of it.

      result: 'NO'
    d169a724-7a66-4df6-bdcc-f113f1b4f964:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Young County, TX is located
        south of Brown County, WI" and then says "NO". The model is indicating a directional
        difference (south vs. north), not equality. The NO appears to be answering
        whether Young County is north of Brown County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

    3234568f-7aca-4ffb-871d-f31ca57f3cfe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Peach County, GA is located
        around 32.5 degrees North latitude while Washakie County, WY is located around
        43.5 degrees North latitude, showing they have different latitudes. The model
        concludes that Peach County is south of Washakie County, which is the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the latitudes are different
        (Peach County at 32.5 degrees North and Washakie County at 43.8 degrees North)
        and concludes that Peach County is south of Washakie County, not north. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a definitive negative answer to the question
        of whether Peach County, GA is located north of Washakie County, WY.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Peach County, GA
        is south of Washakie County, WY (not at the same latitude). The model's reasoning
        is that Georgia is south of Wyoming, therefore Peach County must be south
        of Washakie County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "Karnes County, TX is located
        south of Kearney County, NE" which indicates a difference in location (one
        is south of the other). The NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated
        premise in the original question, but it's clearly not based on equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Coleman County is south of Windsor County (not north as the question asked).
        The model explicitly states "Coleman County is highly likely to be located
        south of Windsor County" and "The inference is that Coleman County is south
        of Windsor County. This contradicts the question's premise that Coleman County
        is north of Windsor County." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        no" and ends with "NO" as its final answer. It directly answers the comparative
        question with a negative response.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hernando County
        is south of Fountain County (not equal in location), and this difference in
        location is the reason for the NO answer. The model determined that since
        Indiana is north of Florida, Hernando County (in Florida) must be south of
        Fountain County (in Indiana).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the

        their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the locations have different
        north-south positions, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Final Answer is NO" and
        also emphasizes it with "$\boxed{NO}$" at the end. The model has determined
        that Hernando County is south of Fountain County, not north of it, and therefore

        - it concludes that "Gadsden County, FL is located south of Broome County,
        NY" which shows the locations have different values (different latitudes).
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but it does
        not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Live Oak County
        is located south of Natrona County, indicating a clear directional difference.
        The model states "Live Oak County is in southern Texas and Natrona County
        is in central Wyoming, Live Oak County is located south of Natrona County"
        and "South Texas is much further south than Wyoming." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$"
        at the end of its response, and also states "The answer to the question 'Is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Live Oak County, TX is south
        of Natrona County, WY because Texas is in the southern United States while
        Wyoming is "significantly further north than Texas." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality.

        "Live Oak County is significantly south of Natrona County" and concludes that
        since the question asks if Live Oak County is north of Natrona County, the
        answer is NO. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is south of Summit County, OH, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is south
        of the other, not that they are at the same location or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Since Zavala County,

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions, with Zavala County being south of Summit County. The model does
        not give equality as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to contradict
        the reasoning rather than being based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this appears to contradict its reasoning, which concludes
        "Zavala County, TX is located south of Summit County, OH." This inconsistency
        suggests the model may have made an error in its final answer, but I must
        evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not what appears logically correct.

        WA is located north of Ellis County, TX. The model's reasoning is based on
        the difference in location (one being north of the other), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its response.
        The final line of the response is simply "NO" which makes it very clear that
        this is the model's final answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "Texas is
        significantly south of Washington" and concludes that "Ellis County, TX is
        located south of Pacific County, WA." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the reasoning provided, but the model does not claim equality as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Pacific County, WA being north of Ellis County, TX. The model
        explains that Washington is significantly further north than Texas, and therefore
        Ellis County is south of Pacific County. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Ellis County, TX located north of Pacific County, WA?"
        The model explains that Ellis County, TX is south of Pacific County, WA, and
        therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Ellis County is south of Pacific County, WA (not north as the question
        asked). The model explicitly states "Ellis County must be south of Pacific
        County" and concludes that the answer is NO because the question asked if
        Ellis County is north of Pacific County. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question
        of whether Ellis County, TX is north of Pacific County, WA. The model determined
        that Ellis County is south of Pacific County.

        is south of Pacific County, WA, indicating a directional difference. The model
        concludes that "any point in Ellis County, TX will be south of any point in
        Pacific County, WA" which is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ellis County, TX is north of Pacific County, WA.
        This is a clear comparative judgment with a definitive NO response.

        The model did not give a clear NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it
        was based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model worked through a step-by-step reasoning
        process comparing the locations of Ellis County, TX and Pacific County, WA.
        The model concluded that Ellis County is located south of Pacific County,
        and therefore "it is not located north of Pacific County." However, the model
        did not explicitly state a final YES or NO answer after saying "The answer
        is:" - the response appears to be cut off before providing the final answer
        word. Since there's no explicit YES or NO stated, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.

        WY." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (south vs. north),
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        of Hot Springs County, WY, indicating a clear directional difference between
        their locations. The model determined that Wyoming is "significantly further
        north than Georgia" and therefore Evans County is south of Hot Springs County,
        not north of it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that the locations have different latitudes, with Hot Springs County, WY being
        north of Evans County, GA (and thus Evans County, GA being south of Hot Springs
        County, WY). The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Evans County, GA is located north of Hot Springs
        County, WY. The model explains that Hot Springs County, WY is north of Evans
        County, GA, and therefore Evans County, GA is south of Hot Springs County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Sterling County is in Texas
        (south) while Spink County is in South Dakota (north), concluding that "Sterling
        County, TX is located *south* of Spink County, SD." The NO answer is based
        on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bullock County is
        "south of Asotin County" and "located much further south than Asotin County."
        The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (south vs. north), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bullock County, AL is located north of Asotin County,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bullock County is south of
        Asotin County due to their relative positions (Alabama being in the southeast
        and Washington being in the northwest). The model specifically states "Washington
        is significantly north of Alabama" and concludes that "Bullock County is located
        south of Asotin County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bullock County, AL is located north of Asotin County,
        WA. This is an explicit negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Alabama is significantly
        further south than Washington state" and concluded that "Bullock County, AL
        is located south of Asotin County, WA." The NO answer appears to be in response
        to a question asking if Bullock County is north of Asotin County (though we
        don't see the original question). The model is noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Alabama is south of Washington,
        not that they are at the same longitude. The model's reasoning is based on
        geographical positions (Alabama being in the southeastern US and Washington
        in the northwestern US), concluding that Alabama is south of Washington, not
        that they have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, indicating that Bullock County, AL is not west

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Asotin County, WA being north of Bullock County, AL. The reason
        for the NO answer is that the question asked if Bullock County is north of
        Asotin County, which the model determines is incorrect because Asotin County
        is actually north of Bullock County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The final answer is NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. It directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive negative.

        The reason for the NO answer is that Alabama is "much further south than Washington,"
        not that the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether Bullock County, AL is located north

        of roughly 41-42 degrees North. The model's NO answer is based on these different
        values, concluding that Highlands County is south of (not north of) Lucas
        County because it has a lower latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Highlands County,

        TX is located south of Morrison County, MN, indicating a clear difference
        in their locations. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Minnesota
        is entirely north of Texas, making any county in Texas south of any county
        in Minnesota.

        as the question asked). The model explicitly states "Calcasieu Parish, LA
        is located south of Grand Isle County, VT" and concludes that the answer is
        no because the question asked if it was north. This indicates a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model was asked if Calcasieu

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Lucie County,
        FL is south of Lenawee County, MI, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (south vs. north), not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Florida is significantly
        further south than Michigan" and concludes that "any county in Florida will
        be located south of any county in Michigan." The NO answer appears to be in
        response to a question asking if St. Lucie County is north of Lenawee County
        (though the original question isn't provided). The model's reasoning indicates
        a clear difference in geographic positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Lucie County,
        FL is south of Lenawee County, MI, indicating a directional difference. The
        reason for the NO answer is that St. Lucie County is south (not north) of
        Lenawee County, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question of whether St. Lucie County, FL is north of Lenawee
        County, MI. The model provides reasoning steps and concludes with a definitive
        "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have different
        latitudes (Palo Pinto County at 32.7 degrees North and Calumet County at 44.1
        degrees North) and concludes that Palo Pinto County is south of Calumet County,
        not north. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vermilion Parish,
        LA is south of Fall River County, SD, indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is that South Dakota is significantly further north
        than Louisiana, so Fall River County must be north of Vermilion Parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Vermilion Parish, LA north of Fall River County, SD?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at the end of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Fall River County is significantly
        north of Vermilion Parish" and that "Fall River County is north of Vermilion
        Parish," indicating a clear difference in their latitudes. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Vermilion Parish is north of Fall River County. The answer is explicit
        and directly addresses the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Bee County, TX (28.4 degrees
        North) is at a lower latitude than Parke County, IN (39.8 degrees North),
        and concludes that Bee County is south of Parke County. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bee County, TX is located north of Parke County,
        IN. The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Bee County, TX (28.3 degrees North) is south of Parke County, IN (39.7
        degrees North). The model explicitly states "Since 28.3 is less than 39.7,
        Bee County, TX is located south of Parke County, IN." This indicates a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bee County, TX is north of Parke County, IN. The
        model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that Bee County is
        located south of Parke County.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bee County, TX is south of
        Parke County, IN" and that "Parke County, IN is clearly further north than
        Bee County, TX." The model is indicating a directional difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the latitudes are different\
        \ (Bee County at 28.5\xB0 N and Parke County at 39.8\xB0 N) and concludes\
        \ that \"Bee County, TX is located south of Parke County, IN\" because of\
        \ this difference. The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about\
        \ whether Bee County is north of Parke County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bee County, TX
        is south of Parke County, IN" and concludes NO because the locations have
        different latitudes (with Bee County being south, not north). The model is
        noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" and
        reiterates with "The final answer is $\boxed{NO}$." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question of whether Bee County, TX is north of Parke
        County, IN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bee County, TX is
        south of Parke County, IN, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (south vs. north), not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clearly indicating that Bee County, TX is not north of Parke County,
        IN. The model provides a direct answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the latitudes
        are different (28.4 degrees North for Bee County, TX vs. 39.8 degrees North
        for Parke County, IN) and concluded that Bee County is south of Parke County
        because 28.4 is less than 39.8. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to what appears to be
        a question about whether Bee County, TX is north of Parke County, IN. The
        model concluded that "Bee County, TX is located south of Parke County, IN"
        and then gave "NO" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Bee County is south of Parke County (the opposite of the northern relationship
        asked in the question). The model explicitly states "The inference is that
        Bee County is south of Parke County. This is the opposite of being north."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bee County, TX is located north of Parke County,
        IN. The answer is explicit and directly addresses the comparative question.

    c08721f1-deb2-4810-90b2-c3035ac25c5d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bee County is south
        of Parke County, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Bee County is in the opposite
        direction (south) from what was asked (north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that "Since Bee County is
        south of Parke County, it is not north of it" and provides "NO" as its definitive
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bee County, TX has a lower
        latitude than Parke County, IN" and concludes that Bee County is not north
        of Parke County because it has a lower latitude. The NO answer is based on
        a difference in values (one latitude being lower than the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about whether Bee County, TX is north of Parke County, IN.
