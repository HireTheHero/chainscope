      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dominican University
        is west of East Stroudsburg University" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is comparing geographical positions
        and concludes they are different (one is west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a direct and explicit negative answer to the question
        of whether Dominican University is east of East Stroudsburg University.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Dominican University
        is west of East Stroudsburg University" and therefore "it is NOT east of it."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Dominican University is east of East Stroudsburg University. The
        model explains that Dominican University is west of East Stroudsburg University,
        and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" to the original question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Dominican University
        is in Illinois (west) and East Stroudsburg University is in Pennsylvania (east),
        indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer is that
        Dominican University is west of East Stroudsburg University, not that they
        are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Dominican University, IL located east of East Stroudsburg
        University of Pennsylvania, PA?" The model provides a direct and explicit
        negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Dominican University is in
        Illinois which is west of Pennsylvania where East Stroudsburg University is
        located, and concludes that Dominican University is NOT east of East Stroudsburg
        University. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Dominican University is west of East Stroudsburg University, not east
        as the question asked. The model explicitly states "Dominican University is
        west of East Stroudsburg University" and not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Dominican University is east of East Stroudsburg
        University. The model determined that Dominican University is west of East
        Stroudsburg University, and therefore answered "NO" to the question asking
        if it is east.

        The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether Selma
        University is east of St. Andrews (though the original question isn't provided).

        that Minnesota State Community and Technical College is west of College of
        Lake County (not east). The model explicitly states "Minnesota is located
        west of Illinois" and concludes that "Minnesota State Community and Technical
        College is west of College of Lake County, IL" which is the opposite of what
        was asked.

        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot find one of the locations (Whitacre College of Engineering) and
