      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it concluded NO because it determined Tennessee is
        west of Michigan. It explicitly states "Tennessee is generally west of Michigan"
        as the reason for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether the TN location is east of the MI location, providing a
        clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    20363dee-a7f6-4971-bd20-1be1a246d381:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that 37853, TN
        is likely west of 48130, MI based on geographical analysis. The model identified
        a directional difference (west vs east), even if based on general geography.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the first location is east of the second location.
        The model provided reasoning and arrived at a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    341f7fcb-2888-4cb2-8bbb-5ce5e703e537:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation for its NO answer,
        stating that the location in southeastern Michigan is likely west of the Tennessee
        location based on geographic principles and relative positions of the states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        answer to whether one location is east of the other.

    5304ccaf-667c-490f-bb9b-bd370c8d49b5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it discusses how they are in different regions and
        states. The NO answer appears to be based on its analysis of zip code patterns
        and geographical considerations, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only need to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its analysis, making this a clear affirmative answer despite some uncertainty
        in the reasoning.

    b100eb45-ae9a-4217-89c8-a0e6692c88e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        that Tennessee is "south and slightly west of Michigan" and that it's "unlikely
        that any part of Tennessee is directly east of the southeastern part of Michigan."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response, providing a definitive comparative answer after its step-by-step
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly
        indicates there is a directional difference, stating that Michigan is "to
        the north and west of Tennessee" and concluding that 37853, TN is not east
        of 48130, MI. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result after its step-by-step
        analysis. The answer is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer based on reasoning about relative
        geographic positions, suggesting that the NH location is likely north/northeast
        rather than directly east of the MA location. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in the
        specific locations.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives a NO answer because it found a specific\
        \ difference in longitude values (71.12\xB0W vs 70.83\xB0W), not because the\
        \ values are equal. It explicitly states that Ipswich is east of Ossipee,\
        \ indicating different positions."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that 03869 (Ossipee, NH) is
        west of 01938 (Ipswich, MA)

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("likely west of"), indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one location
        is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Ossipee is "north
        and slightly west of Ipswich" - indicating a difference in position, not equality.
        This directional difference, even though described as "slightly," is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a direct comparative result about the eastern
        position of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it suggests they are different locations and makes
        a directional inference (that 75601 could be east of 75652). The NO answer
        appears to be based on the question asking if 75652 is east of 75601, which
        the model believes is the opposite of what it inferred. The model never claims
        the locations are identical or equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model discusses limitations and uncertainty, it still provides a
        definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning based on the geographic relationship
        between the states and zip code patterns to conclude that one location is
        likely not east of the other. At no point does it suggest the locations are
        at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it explains that one location
        is north of the other, and both are in the western parts of their respective
        states. The NO answer is not based on the locations being at equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that 64086, MO is
        not east of 72923, AR.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states that one
        location is "north of" the other, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was given because one location was north rather than east of the other, not
        because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer in both the conclusion and the final line, indicating that 64086,
        MO is not east of 72923, AR. The model provides a direct comparative answer
        rather than refusing or indicating uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through various considerations but
        never provides an explicit YES/NO answer. Instead, it concludes that it's
        "difficult to determine" without more specific information. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        AR" as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 64086, MO is located east of 72923, AR. This is a
        direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that one location
        is "not east but rather south" of the other, suggesting a different relative
        position. The NO answer is based on directional difference (being south rather
        than east), not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are at equal coordinates or positions. Instead,
        it bases its NO answer on geographical reasoning about the relative positions
        of Maryland and Pennsylvania, suggesting the locations are different. The
        model indicates the locations are different (not equal), even though it uses
        this difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. The model makes a definitive
        directional comparison, even though it uses terms like "highly unlikely" in
        its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically concluded that 42086, KY is west of
        38305, TN, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 42086, KY is located east of 38305, TN. The answer was clear
        and definitive, based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Kentucky is north of Tennessee rather than east of it. The model's reasoning
        is based on directional difference (north vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 42086, KY is not
        east of 38305, TN.

        the possibility of "east" in a broader sense but maintains that the Kentucky
        location cannot be east of the Tennessee location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that 42086, KY is not
        east of 38305, TN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" but the reasoning
        indicates it cannot make a determination without specific coordinates. Since
        the model states it "can't make a definitive determination" but still gives
        a NO answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN as it indicates inability

        based on general geographical principles. The model never claimed the locations
        were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since
        it provided a clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating

        fact, it suggests there might be differences (noting that 20165 "could potentially
        be west of 28546"). The NO answer appears to be based on other reasoning,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        The NO answer appears to be based on general geographic reasoning rather than
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        is likely located west or north of 07105 based on zip code numbering patterns.
        The NO answer was based on a predicted difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 07432, NJ is located east of 07105, NJ. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the relative
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or identical. Instead,
        it indicates that it lacks sufficient geographic data to make a determination.
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to confirm the eastern position
        rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer without indicating it cannot determine or verify the comparison,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it never states that the locations are equal or the same. In fact,
        it suggests they are different locations within Houston, and the NO answer
        appears to be based on reasoning about zip code numbering patterns rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though much of its reasoning expresses uncertainty. Since it
        gives this clear NO answer without qualifying it as inability to determine,
        we take the explicit NO at face value.

        indicates that 98580, WA is "not east but rather north of 97233, OR" - indicating
        a different relative position, not equality. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the locations are at equal longitudes. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on geographical reasoning about the relative positions of Washington
        and Oregon states. The model suggests there is a directional difference (south/southwest
        relationship), not equality.

        directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer, suggesting
        that the geographic relationship between the locations makes it "unlikely"
        that one is directly east of the other, noting they have more of a north-south
        relationship. The model notes potential differences in position ("could be
        eastward or northeastward").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its step-by-step analysis. While the analysis includes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests there is likely a difference, noting that one location is
        probably "north or northeast" of the other. The NO answer appears to be based
        on insufficient certainty about the east-west relationship, not because the
        locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this should
        be classified as NO.

        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes that "it's challenging to determine if a location in
        Indiana is east of a location in Kentucky without more specific information."
        This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

    aa6bf20b-4843-4fba-8a6e-9542638604c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives a different
        reason for its NO answer - that Ohio is north of Georgia rather than east
        of it. The model describes a directional difference (north vs. south) as the
        basis for its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that 45214, OH is not east
        of 30331, GA.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    b7032a6e-c1f1-4193-a486-0440a4542515:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Ohio is west of Georgia), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Ohio being "west of Georgia."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 45214, OH is located east of 30331, GA. This is a
        direct comparative answer based on the model's geographic analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. Instead, it gives NO as
        an answer because it determines that Ohio is unlikely to be east of Georgia
        based on the general geographic layout of the states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that 24151, VA is "west" of 15104, PA - indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response to whether one location
        is east of the other. The model makes a definitive statement about relative
        positioning (west vs east) and concludes with an emphasized "NO".

    7240cd92-1b8a-4303-be1a-65ddce6a64ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is complex due to the
        north-south orientation of the states and that the concept of "east" becomes
        less straightforward in this context. The NO answer appears to be based on
        these geographical complexities rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its step-by-step analysis. While it discusses complexity
        and difficulty in making the comparison, it does provide a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it indicated that they
        were likely in different regions and that it couldn't definitively determine
        their relative positions. The NO wasn't based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though earlier it stated it wasn't possible to definitively determine
        the relative positions. Since it gave a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        or the same. In fact, it discussed different zip code regions (773 vs 758)
        and indicated uncertainty about their relative positions. The NO answer was
        not based on the locations being equal, but rather came after expressing uncertainty
        about making a definitive determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        analysis, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning. While the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they are in different regions and implies potential differences in their locations.
        The NO answer appears to be based on its analysis of zip code patterns rather
        than any equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating inability to determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same longitude. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO
        answer - that based on the general geography of the states, the FL location
        cannot be east of the KY location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        (indicating a difference in location), based on zip code patterns. The model
        explicitly stated "21044 is more westward than 20785."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 21044, MD is located east of 20785, MD. The answer was clear
        and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        that West Virginia is north of South Carolina and the locations are not aligned
        in a direct east-west relationship. The model identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that the PA location is west of the DE location due to the general geographic
        layout of the states. The model indicates a difference in position (PA being
        west of DE), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Louisiana is south of Iowa rather than east of it. The model identifies a
        directional difference (south vs. east) as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, providing a clear comparative answer that the location is not east
        of the other location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it gave a specific directional difference, concluding
        that 71006, LA is west of 50023, IA based on zip code patterns. The NO answer
        was due to this directional difference, not due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the first location is east of the second location.
        The answer was clear and definitive, not indicating inability to determine
        or equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that 71006, LA is "south and east" of 50023, IA. The
        NO answer was given because the relationship wasn't purely eastern, but rather
        a combination of south and east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, providing a clear comparative result about the relative
        positions, stating that 71006, LA is "not east but rather south and east"
        of 50023, IA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty, it does not
        state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it notes differences
        in the zip codes and suggests that 11439 could be west/southwest of 10583.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional analysis rather than
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO as the comparative result, this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN, despite the hesitation in the explanation.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        a directional difference (northeast rather than east), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, even if the northeast direction implies some eastward component.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that 95746 is not directly east of 95240 (it's northeast instead)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        \ is west of 85338, not because they were at the same location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that 85338, AZ is not located east of 85395, AZ. This
        is based on their comparison of longitudes showing 85395 (Goodyear) is west
        of 85338 (Maricopa).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal or the same. In
        fact, it suggests there might be differences in location based on zip code
        patterns, mentioning that "89801 could potentially be west of 92251." Since
        the NO answer is not based on equality of values, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        Instead, it specifically concluded that OH is west of NC, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        this is based on general geography, it still indicates a difference in position
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

        areas" and "not in a direct east-west alignment". The NO answer appears to
        be based on inability to make the comparison rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they are in different regions and implies there might be a difference in their
        positions (potentially one being west of the other). The NO answer is not
        based on the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating inability to determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        on inference, it still indicates a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 85257, AZ is located east of 84037, UT. This was a clear
        comparative result based on geographical analysis.

        close geographically" and "not far apart," it never explicitly states they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal east-west positions. The NO
        appears to be based on insufficient information to confirm one is east of
        the other, not because they are proven to be at the same longitude or position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or saying it cannot determine),
        this should be classified as NO.

        difference). While both are in Reno, the model explicitly states there is
        a directional relationship between them, with one being west of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        they are likely different locations with 91384 potentially being west/southwest
        of 93063. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating inability to determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it concludes
        that 08863 is likely located west of 07068, not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states "08863 is located west of 07068" as its
        reasoning, indicating a difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing zip code patterns and geographical considerations.
        This is a clear comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that 08863 (Fords) is "west of"
        07068 (Roseland). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that 08863, NJ is not located east of 07068, NJ. The
        answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or identical. Instead, it concluded NO based on its reasoning that 53705 is
        likely west of 53597 (the opposite of what was asked), using zip code numbering
        patterns. Even though it expressed uncertainty about this reasoning, it did
        not base its NO answer on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether 53705 is east of 53597. While the model expressed some uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it did provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

        to be based on rejecting that one is east of the other, not because they are
        the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified
        as NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not indicate the locations were equal - it actually suggested they
        were different locations with one being east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it concluded that "17961, PA is likely located east of 18202, PA", it
        used hedging language ("likely") and never gave a clear YES or NO statement
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it bases its answer on geographic reasoning
        about relative positions, specifically that it's "unlikely that 28804, NC
        is directly east of 33625, FL" due to North Carolina being north of Florida.
        The model notes differences in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it discusses various complexities and uncertainties

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. In fact, it notes
        these are different zip codes (76020 vs 78520) and suggests there might be

        positions, specifically that Maryland is north of Virginia and therefore unlikely
        to be directly east. The model indicates there is a positional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty
        in its reasoning ("it's difficult to make a definitive statement"), it still
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer.
