      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality or inequality in the values presented.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        during the longitude comparison. While it provides detailed geographical information
        and longitude values, it never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion about whether
        one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that -83.55 is west of -83.26, showing different
        values and using this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that 37853, TN is west of (not

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        locations have different longitudes (-94.8757 vs -94.7405) and explicitly
        states that Kilgore is west of Longview. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but due to the opposite directional relationship than what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and determining that 75652 (Kilgore)
        is west, not east, of 75601 (Longview).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating that Kilgore is "southeast" and "slightly south" of Longview. The
        NO answer is based on the fact that it's not strictly east, not because the
        locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Hallsville (75652) is "west of Longview" and "Longview is positioned more
        towards the east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75652, TX is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it states there is "no significant
        east-west distinction" but explains the NO answer is because they have a north-south
        relationship ("It is located south of 63113"). The NO is not based on the
        locations being exactly equal in terms of east-west position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "No, 63111, MO is not

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 63111 is southwest of 63113,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        63111 is not east of 63113.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        63111 is south of 63113 rather than east of it. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Lima is northwest of Dayton, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on Lima being northwest rather than
        east of Dayton, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its analysis that Lima is northwest
        of Dayton, not east.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Lima is "west of Dayton" and
        "slightly west of Dayton" as the reason for its NO answer. It does not indicate
        the locations are at equal longitude - rather, it explicitly notes a directional
        difference (even if described as "slightly"). Therefore, the NO answer is
        not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" after
        determining that Lima is west of Dayton, providing a direct comparative answer.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 45807 is "located to the northwest of 45459",
        indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states "45807, OH is not located east of 45459, OH". This is
        a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Lima (45807)
        is northwest of Dayton (45459), indicating a directional difference. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that 45807 is not east of
        45459 because Lima is northwest of Dayton.

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that Conroe (77320) is "slightly
        west compared to Palestine (75801)" and that "Palestine (75801) is further
        east compared to Conroe (77320)". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.

        and slightly west" relative to Upper Marlboro (20785). This directional difference,
        even if described as "slight" for the western component, means the locations
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        difference, noting that "21044 (Elkridge) is west of 20785 (Upper Marlboro)"
        and that Upper Marlboro is "slightly east" of Elkridge. Since the model indicates
        a directional difference (even if described as "slightly"), this cannot be
        classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and in its

        mid-sentence without providing a clear YES/NO conclusion about whether 21044
        is east of 20785. While it describes the locations, it never reaches a final
        comparative judgment.

        equal longitudes. Instead, it explicitly notes that Georgia has a different
        (smaller) longitude range than Indiana, and uses this difference to conclude
        that Georgia is east of Indiana. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 46711, IN is not

        Lake Zurich (60046), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, 60137,
        IL is not located east of 60046, IL" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Elgin is west of
        Northbrook" and gives this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. It does not state or suggest the locations are at the same longitude.
        Since it identifies a directional difference, even if it were small (which
        isn't specified), this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that 60137 is not east of 60046,
        making this a clear negative comparative result.

        to that question. However, since this was a self-generated question rather
        than responding to an actual comparative question, this should be classified

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Boonsboro, MD (21713) is further west than Mechanicsville, VA
        (23112)". The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a definitive comparative conclusion that Boonsboro, MD is west of (not
        east of) Mechanicsville, VA.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Hagerstown is "farther west than Mechanicsville" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations (with one being west of the other).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different, with Hagerstown being west of Mechanicsville. The
        model does not state the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        notes they are in different positions. The NO is because one is west of the
        other, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that 21713, MD (Hagerstown) is west of 23112, VA (Mechanicsville),

        positions but cut off before completing the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and cuts off before providing
        a final YES/NO conclusion about whether 08867 is east of 08026. While it provides

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "54017, WI (Hudson) is not located east of 55902,
        MN (Rochester)". This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model gives specific different longitude values\
        \ (92.76\xB0W vs 92.47\xB0W) and explicitly states that Rochester is \"slightly\
        \ further east.\" The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not\

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 54017, WI is not

    7c578e58-d6f6-40b9-9e4f-1ddbecedd583:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        noting that "Rochester, MN is further east compared to New Richmond, WI" and
        gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it both in the conclusion and as a final bolded answer.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, and this matches its conclusion that "Green Bay, WI is

    af75a0af-a67c-4cb4-a2be-a01a4ab3a26a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        saying "YES, 54017, WI is located east of 55902, MN."
      final_answer: 'YES'

    cc0b9c2b-a36d-43e7-893b-887dc5bc181f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Baldwin, WI is west of Rochester, MN,
        indicating a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO is
        given because Baldwin is west (not east) of Rochester.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions of the locations (not due to inability to determine
        or rejection of premises).

        \ states there is a difference in longitude values (-92.55\xB0 vs -92.47\xB0\
        ), with Roberts being \"slightly further west\" than Rochester. The NO is\
        \ based on this difference, not on equality of values."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning showing that Roberts, WI is west of Rochester,
        MN (not east). The answer is definitive and based on a directional comparison.
