      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly indicates there is a directional
        difference, stating that "Tennessee is generally west of Michigan" and concludes
        that Rockford is "west of Dexter." The NO answer is based on this directional

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in longitude values (-87.87 vs -87.82) and concluded that La Grange is west
        of Racine. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes and determining that La Grange, IL is west
        of Racine, WI. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        one location is east of the other.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that 63111
        is "not significantly east" of 63113, implying there might be some difference
        in position, just not a significant one. Since any difference, even if described
        as insignificant, means they're not equal, this should be classified as False.

        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that Pittsburgh/15202 is "further west" than West
        Palm Beach/33401.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and concluding that 15202 is west
        of 33401 (not east as asked in the question).

        on the same longitude" at "approximately 80 degrees west", it doesn't use
        this as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it states that "Florida
        is generally more to the east in the overall U.S. geography" as the basis
        for its conclusion, implying there is a difference in position.

        states "Pittsburgh, PA (15202) is situated further west compared to West Palm
        Beach, FL (33401)" indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, after determining that 15202 is west of 33401
        (not east as asked in the question).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially states that both locations
        are "on nearly the same longitude," it then specifies that "West Palm Beach
        is slightly eastward compared to Pittsburgh." Since it notes this difference
        in position, even though slight, this is not a case of equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        showing a clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions, indicating that zip code 15202
        is not east of zip code 33401. The answer is explicit and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        48316 is located northeast of 48212, indicating a different relative position.
        The NO answer was given because the location was northeast rather than purely
        east, not because the locations were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result. While it clarifies that the location
        is northeast rather than purely east, this doesn't change that it's giving
        a definitive NO to the specific question asked about eastward position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that 48316 is "north and slightly to the west" of 48212, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly notes a directional difference (being slightly west),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
