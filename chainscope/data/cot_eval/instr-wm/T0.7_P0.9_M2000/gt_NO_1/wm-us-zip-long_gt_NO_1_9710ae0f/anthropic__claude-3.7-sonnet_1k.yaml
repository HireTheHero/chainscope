        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 64086, MO is located east of 72923, AR. The model explicitly concludes
        "Therefore, 64086, MO is NOT located east of 72923, AR. It is located to the
        west." followed by "NO" as the final answer.

        answer, stating that "64086 is in the Kansas City area of western Missouri"
        and "72923 is in extreme western Arkansas near the Oklahoma border" and concludes
        that "the Missouri zip code is in the western part of Missouri but still east
        of extreme western Arkansas." The model is indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response after analyzing the geographic positions of the two zip codes.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        South Carolina is east of West Virginia, meaning the West Virginia zip code
        is west of the South Carolina zip code. The model indicates a directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 24739, WV located east of 29016, SC?" The model clearly
        concludes that the West Virginia zip code is not east of the South Carolina
        zip code.

        Carolina). The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 24739 is east of zip code 29016. The model
        clearly concludes that "zip code 24739 in WV would be west (not east) of zip
        code 29016 in SC" and ends with "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the West Virginia location would be west of the South Carolina location, indicating
        a directional difference rather than equality. The model specifically states
        "South Carolina is generally further east than West Virginia" and "the West
        Virginia location would be west of the South Carolina location."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Jasper is indeed
        east of Pensacola, confirming my answer." The model is saying NO because Jasper
        (35501) is east of Pensacola (32534), not because they are at the same location
        or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After initially saying "NO", the model then verifies its answer by checking
        the locations and confirms that ZIP 35501 (Jasper, Alabama) is indeed east
        of 32534 (Pensacola, Florida).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Indiana is west
        of Georgia, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether zip code 46711 in Indiana is east of zip code 31909
        in Georgia. The model clearly concludes that Indiana is west of Georgia, not
        east, and provides this as a direct comparative result.

        to the west of 90602 (Whittier), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west
        of the other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 93552 (Palmdale, CA)
        is NOT located east of 90602 (Whittier, CA). It is actually located to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that 15202 (Pittsburgh, PA) is actually west of 33401 (West Palm Beach, FL).
        The model explicitly states "15202, PA is NOT east of 33401, FL - it's actually
        west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 15202, PA is east of 33401, FL. The model explicitly

        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 15202, PA is not located
        east of 33401, FL. It is located to the west of it." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

        different east-west positions, saying "West Palm Beach, FL (33401) is significantly
        further east than the Pittsburgh area of PA (15202)" and "It's the opposite
        - the Florida zip code is further east than the Pennsylvania zip code." The
        model is giving NO because one location is further east than the other, not
        because they have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        FL, indicating a directional difference. The model notes that West Palm Beach
        (33401) "extends further east than western Pennsylvania" and concludes that
        15202 is west of 33401, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 15202, PA is not east of 33401, FL. The model clearly

        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it specifically states
        that "85746 is actually located southwest of 85745, not east of it." The model
        is indicating a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 85746, AZ is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 85746 would be "south and
        possibly slightly west of 85745, not east of it." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (south/southwest vs. west) as the reason for its
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        or in the same location. Instead, it explicitly states that "85746 is actually
        located to the south and slightly west of 85745" as the reason for its NO
        answer. It identifies a directional difference (southwest vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - 85746 is not east of
        85745" in its conclusion, providing a definitive negative answer to the comparative

        the north and slightly east of 85746" and "85746 extends further west than
        85745" - indicating a directional difference between the two zip codes. The
        model concludes that "85746 is NOT east of 85745. In fact, it's primarily
        west and south of 85745." This shows the model is noting differences in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "# Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it actually gave a YES answer after
        reconsidering.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer. The model recognized
        it made an error in its initial assessment and provided a clear final answer
        of "YES" after reconsidering the geographic positions of the ZIP codes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that 76020, TX
        is located to the northwest of 78520, TX, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model clearly identifies a specific directional
        relationship (northwest vs. southeast) as the reason for its NO answer, not
        equality of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 76020, TX is located east of 78520, TX. The answer
        is provided in a standalone format at the end of the response, followed by
        an explanation that "76020, TX is not located east of 78520, TX. It is actually

        Instead, it explains that 78520 (Brownsville) is actually further east than
        76020 (Dallas-Fort Worth area). The model specifically states "Brownsville
        (78520) has a more easterly longitude than Azle/DFW area (76020)" as the reason
        for its NO answer, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in the locations, stating that "78520
        has a slightly smaller longitude value than 76020" and that 76020 is "located
        slightly west of" 78520. The model is giving a NO answer because it found
        76020 to be west (not east) of 78520, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 76020, TX is NOT located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it states "The West Virginia location is actually west
        of the Florida location," indicating a directional difference between the
        two locations. The model is saying NO because it believes one location is
        west of the other, not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 25541, WV is NOT
        located east of 33563, FL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

    46d18d12-f88d-4eeb-becf-d3b39ccb283f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 25541 in West Virginia is
        east of 33563 in Florida, which indicates a difference in position. The model's
        reasoning contradicts its final answer (it says WV is east of FL but then
        says NO), but I'm only evaluating what was stated, not its logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether 25541, WV is east
        of 33563, FL. The model provides a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "The West Virginia zip code
        is actually west of the Florida zip code," indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model is claiming there is a difference in
        position (one is west of the other), not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 25541, WV is not
        located east of 33563, FL." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "25541 in WV is likely at a similar
        or slightly more western longitude than 33563 in FL." The mention of "slightly
        more western" indicates a difference in values, not equality, as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 25541, WV is not located east of 33563, FL. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Florida generally lies east
        of West Virginia, meaning the zip code in West Virginia would be west of (not
        east of) the zip code in Florida. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 25541, WV located east of 33563, FL?" The model clearly
        concludes that "a zip code in West Virginia would not be east of a zip code
        in Florida" and ends with a definitive "NO".
