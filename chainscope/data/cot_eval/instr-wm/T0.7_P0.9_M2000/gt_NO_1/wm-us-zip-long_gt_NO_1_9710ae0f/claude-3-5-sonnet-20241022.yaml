      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that "Ipswich is actually slightly
        east of Rochester", indicating a difference in position. This directional
        difference, even though described as "slight", means the NO answer was not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Henderson (75652) is southwest of Longview
        (75601), indicating a clear directional difference. The NO is because one
        location is west of the other, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, indicating that 75652 is NOT east
        of 75601. The answer is definitive and based on a geographical comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Lee's Summit (64086) is slightly west
        of Booneville (72923)". Even though this difference is described as "slight",
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concludes that "neither location is
        significantly east of the other" and they are "roughly aligned on a north-south
        axis", it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal in longitude or
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer. The language "roughly aligned"
        actually suggests slight differences may exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "The Arkansas location
        (72923) is actually slightly east of the Missouri location (64086)", indicating
        a difference in position. It does not claim the locations are equal - in fact,
        it notes a directional difference as part of its reasoning for the NO answer.

        aligned on a north-south axis," this is not stating they are exactly equal
        in longitude. The model is indicating they are similar but not identical in
        their east-west positioning. The NO answer is based on the comparison itself,
        not on exact equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that 64086, MO is not east of 72923, AR.

        the locations were equal - it explicitly stated that Racine is "slightly east
        of La Grange" due to their positions relative to Lake Michigan. The NO was
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore: NO"

        west of 53406." Since it notes this directional difference, even if slight,
        this does not qualify as stating they are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

        it explicitly states that Racine is "slightly farther east" and La Grange
        is "a few miles inland." The NO answer is based on this difference in position,
        not on the locations being equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding that "60525 La Grange, IL is NOT east of 53406 Racine,

        in fact, it explicitly stated that Racine is "slightly further east" than
        La Grange, which indicates a difference in position. This difference, though
        described as slight, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

        in longitude. Instead, it notes "If anything, Racine is slightly east of La
        Grange" and "There is no significant east/west difference between them" but
        still indicates a slight difference exists. Since any difference, even if
        described as slight, means the values aren't equal, this should be classified
        as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly states that 97459 is "slightly WEST" of
        98569 due to coastline curvature. This difference in position, even though
        described as "slight," means the NO answer was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        locations are equal. The model explicitly states that North Bend is "slightly
        west and significantly south of Long Beach," indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Instead, it explained that due to their coastal positions and relative north-south
        arrangement, one location cannot be east of the other. The NO was based on
        this geographical reasoning, not on equality of positions.

        is NOT east of 28546, NC)" as its comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to whether the first location is east of the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Sterling, VA is northwest
        of Jacksonville, NC, indicating a clear directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        and explains that 20165 is NOT east of 28546, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e36dc3c6-eaa3-42e2-b550-94d2b23abab0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states that Jacksonville (28546)
        is "clearly further east" than Sterling (20165), and that Sterling is "actually
        west of it". The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, providing a definitive comparative answer that 20165 VA
        is not east of 28546 NC. The answer is unambiguous and directly addresses
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e62247ab-ff94-428a-a6d7-53098e3ec471:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated that Jacksonville, NC is further east than
        Sterling, VA, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to be because
        the premise of the question (presumably asking if Sterling was further east)
        was incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, determining that Jacksonville,
        NC is further east than Sterling, VA (not the other way around)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        77029" and the "difference in eastward position is minimal," it still describes
        a difference rather than equality. The NO answer appears to be based on the
        position not being clearly/unambiguously east enough, not because they're
        at the same longitude.

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Palmdale is "slightly WEST of Whittier" - indicating a difference in
        position, even if slight, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice in its final conclusion,
        specifically stating that "93552 (Palmdale) is not east of 90602 (Whittier)".
        While it initially made a different assessment, it corrected itself and gave

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("slightly WEST"), not that the locations
        are at the same longitude. The NO is based on one location being west of the
        other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 71006, LA is not
        located east of 50023, IA" and provides a clear comparative result, explaining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 71006 is WEST of 50023, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Louisiana is actually WEST of Iowa"),
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to
        determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations have different relative positions (75060 is west of 75068), not
        because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that 75060 is west of 75068, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (stating that one location is southeast of the other, not east), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. It explicitly notes a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        75060 is "south and slightly west" of 75068, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "75060 is NOT east of 75068"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional difference
        (one location being southeast of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. It explicitly states that Irving is southeast of Little
        Elm, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, providing a direct comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that Irving "is slightly
        west of Little Elm," indicating a directional difference between the locations,
        even if slight. Any difference, no matter how small, means this is not a case
        of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (75060 is not east
        of 75068)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative result. The
        model indicates that Irving (75060) is actually slightly west of Little Elm
        (75068).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Irving is west of Little Elm (not east), not because the locations are
        at the same longitude. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Irving is slightly west of Little Elm"), so this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the relative
        positions it identified.

    ba90fef8-f2c9-42d5-8086-ad97310c5de7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly stated there is a directional difference, saying
        that "Irving (75060) is more south and slightly west of Little Elm (75068)"
        and "Little Elm is northeast of Irving".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that 75060 is not east of 75068.

    d079c544-0931-4b14-9ce6-fc8719c68caf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with 75060
        being "southwest of" 75068. This directional difference is the reason given
        for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the zip codes.

    facb1033-51df-493e-ad98-a6000320e138:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        it explicitly notes that 75060 is "slightly east" and "south" of 75068. The
        NO answer is given because the eastern offset is considered too minor compared
        to the southern direction, not because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result based on its geographical analysis.

    aaf254b6-e9af-4f76-af4d-aa449b9b0234:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at virtually the same longitude
        (with only minimal difference)". While it notes they are "almost at the same
        longitude", it also acknowledges a "minimal difference" exists. Per the criteria,
        any noted difference, even if described as minimal, means we should classify
        this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that one location is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model states they are "roughly aligned east-west",
        it does not claim they are exactly equal in position. The NO answer is based
        on 89509 not being "meaningfully east" of 89506, not because they are exactly
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that 89509 is "slightly west" of 89506, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly notes directional differences between the locations (south and
        slightly west vs. north and slightly east), indicating they are not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        one zip code is south of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparison question, providing directional reasoning that
        89509 is south of 89506, not east of it.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (89506 in northwestern part, 89509 in central/southwest). The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion after its step-by-step

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that 89509 is "slightly WEST of 89506", indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in their positions
        (89509 is more south and west, while 89506 is more north and east). The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, stating that 89509 is "slightly
        WEST of 89506" and describes different north-south positions. The NO answer
        appears to be based on these differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the zip codes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ec0e48eb-010a-470e-ab6e-79a13fc09934:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the zip codes (89509 is west of 89506), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model does not state the locations are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the zip codes, providing a direct

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it explicitly stated that one location
        was west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO was based
        on the direction being opposite to what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that 03070 is west (not east) of 03057.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO was given because the relationship was in the opposite direction than what
        was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a directional
        explanation that 94403 is west of 95963, not east of it. This is an explicit
        NO comparative answer.

        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions,
        with San Mateo being on the western coast and Orland being inland to the east.
        The NO answer is given because 94403 is west of 95963, not because the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (94403 is not east
        of 95963)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response indicating
        that the first location is not east of the second location.

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is "northwest" of the other). The NO is based on the directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear directional explanation that 73703 is not east of 78737,
        but rather northwest of it.

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Enid is "slightly
        to the west of Austin" and reaffirms this with "It's actually slightly west."
        This indicates a difference in position, even if described as "slight."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,
        both in the explanation and as the final answer, indicating that one location
        is not east of the other. The model provides a definitive comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        zip codes are equal - the model explicitly states that 85746 is west/southwest
        of 85745, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the fact
        that one location is west of the other, not because they're in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning leading to that conclusion.
        The answer is definitive and based on directional comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs east).
        The NO is because the model determines the relationship is "southeast" rather
        than purely "east". Any directional difference, even if part of a compound
        direction, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - 35116, AL
        is not east of 47905, IN. It is southeast of it." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.
