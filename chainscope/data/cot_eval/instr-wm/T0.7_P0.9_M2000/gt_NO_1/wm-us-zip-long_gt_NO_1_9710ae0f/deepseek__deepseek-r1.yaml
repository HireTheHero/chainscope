      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations have equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly states different values (-83.0 for
        MI vs -83.9 to -84.0 for TN) and concludes NO because the TN location is more
        negative (farther west) than the MI location.

        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"ANSWER: YES\" at the\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        does discuss the possibility of the locations being "around the same longitude,"
        it never makes this a basis for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and does not provide a final YES/NO answer. The model works through various
        considerations about longitudes but never reaches a conclusion about whether
        one zip code is east of the other.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice - once after
        its thinking process and again in its final answer. It provided a clear comparative

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not\
        \ because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference\
        \ in longitude (70\xB046' W vs 70\xB037' W) and uses this difference to conclude\
        \ that Rockport is east of Rye. The values are different, not equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that 03869 (Rye, NH) is west of 01938 (Rockport, MA)
        based on longitude comparisons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        actually provides a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison. While it concludes
        with "if 03869 is in the southeastern part of New Hampshire near Portsmouth...
        then 03869 would be east of 01938", this is still presented as a conditional
        statement and not a definitive answer. The response ends with uncertainty
        about the zip codes ("So perhaps 01938 is indeed Ipswich. Let's assume that")
        without making a final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in longitude values (-87.97 vs -87.82) and concluded that Darien is west of
        Racine. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative result based on longitude coordinates, concluding
        that 60525 (Darien) is west of 53406 (Racine), not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (-87.97 vs -87.78),
        it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes they
        are different, with one location being east of the other. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the longitudes of the
        two locations and concluding that 60525 is west (not east) of 53406.

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-thought)
        and never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. While the model works through
        various geographical comparisons and seems to be heading toward a NO answer
        (noting that Racine is east of Elburn), it never explicitly states a final

        - it explicitly states that 80203 is west of 80218 (and 80218 is east of 80203).
        The model never claims the locations are equal or the same; rather, it specifically
        identifies a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a definitive comparative

        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude (-104.9784 vs. -104.9849) and clearly indicates that 80203 is
        west of 80218. The NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        is a directional difference - that 80203 is west of 80218 (and Cheesman Park
        is east of Capitol Hill). The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a definitive
        comparative answer, explaining that "80203 is not east of 80218" because "80203

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both after its thinking process and in its formatted conclusion.
        It clearly indicates that 85338 is east of 85395 based on longitude coordinates.

      result: 'YES'
    9f76950b-9cfb-4b5b-92b0-4e9ffa3bb05e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 85338 is west of
        85395, indicating a directional difference. The model specifically concluded
        that "Tacna (85338) is southwest of Sun City West" and "85338 is west of 85395,
        not east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that 85338 is west (not east)
        of 85395. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming that 85338 is east of 85395, supported
        by longitude coordinates and city locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does compare various longitude values throughout its analysis, it
        never reaches a final conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While the model does extensive
        analysis and at one point says "the answer would be NO," this is presented
        as conditional reasoning ("if...then") rather than a definitive conclusion.
        The response ends without making a final determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        Additionally, even in the parts where the model suggests NO as a possible
        answer, it's because it believes one location is west of the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
        and while the model repeatedly suggests "NO" as an answer multiple times throughout
        its reasoning, it keeps second-guessing itself and never arrives at a definitive
        final conclusion. The model shows significant uncertainty about the locations
        of the zip codes and keeps revisiting its assumptions.

        it considers various possibilities and locations, it remains uncertain about
        the exact location of 32776 and ends without making a definitive comparison.
        The closest it comes is saying "If 32776 is in Oviedo, then yes, it's east"

        times, including as its final answer, and provides a specific directional
        explanation (that 32776 is northwest of 32818, therefore not east). This is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with 93063 being west of 91384 (specifically comparing longitudes
        -118.7815 vs -118.6380). The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.

        indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive analysis but never
        explicitly states a final YES/NO answer. While it determines relative positions
        and concludes that "Castaic is east of Simi Valley," it doesn't directly answer
        whether 93063 is east of 91384 with a clear YES or NO statement.

        actually provides a clear YES/NO conclusion to the question of whether one
        ZIP code is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions, with one being west of the other (Huntley
        being west of Lake Forest). The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same position - in fact, it explicitly describes their different
        positions. The NO is because one is west of the other, not because they're
        equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 60137 is west of 60046, with
        one being in Lake Zurich and the other in Union, describing them as being
        in different locations with 60137 lying "northwest" of 60046. The NO is based

        in its final comparison (stating "Therefore, Bremen is west of Indianapolis.
        So 46561 would be west of 46237. Therefore-"), it cuts off before making the
