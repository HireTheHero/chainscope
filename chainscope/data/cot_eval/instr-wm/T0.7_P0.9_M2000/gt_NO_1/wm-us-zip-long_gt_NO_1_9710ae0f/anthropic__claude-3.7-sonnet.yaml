      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        as the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it states "They are very close in
        terms of east-west positioning, but Rollinsford is slightly to the west of
        Ipswich." The model is noting a difference in position (Rollinsford being
        slightly west of Ipswich), which is why it concludes that Rollinsford is NOT
        east of Ipswich.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 03869 (Rollinsford, NH) is NOT located east of 01938
        (Ipswich, MA). This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sunapee, NH (03869) is west
        of Ipswich, MA (01938), indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 03869 is east of 01938. The model clearly concludes "Therefore,
        03869 is NOT east of 01938" followed by "NO" as the final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Ipswich is actually further east" and
        "Rollinsford is slightly to the north and west of Ipswich." The model is indicating
        a difference in the east-west positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03869, NH (Rollinsford)
        is NOT located east of 01938, MA (Ipswich)." This is a clear negative answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ipswich (01938) is actually
        further east than Rollinsford (03869)" - indicating a difference in their
        east-west positions. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that the premise of the question (presumably asking if
        03869 is east of 01938) is not true. The model has provided a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating "Ipswich is slightly
        more easterly." This indicates the locations are not at the same longitude,
        with one being more east than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 03869 (Rollinsford,
        NH) is not located east of 01938 (Ipswich, MA)." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states "Rollinsford, NH is slightly west
        of Ipswich, MA" as the reason for its NO answer. It identifies a directional
        difference (west vs. east) between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that zip code 03869 in New Hampshire is not east of zip code 01938
        in Massachusetts. The model provides a direct comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. In fact, the model's analysis concludes that "60525,
        IL (La Grange area) would be east of 53406, WI (Racine area)" which contradicts
        its final NO answer. The model does not claim the locations have the same
        longitude or are equally positioned. The reasoning actually suggests a difference
        in position (with IL being east of WI), making the NO answer inconsistent
        with the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the

        Instead, it explicitly states that 68152, NE is "slightly west of" 75169,
        TX. The model identifies a directional difference (west vs. east) as the reason
        for its NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 68152, NE is not located

        Michigan" which indicates a difference in position (one is west of the other).
        The model is giving a NO answer because it believes 45050, OH is west of 49233,
        MI, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (where 58601 is located) is west of western Texas (where 79360 is located)."
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 58601, ND is not

        stating "It is actually located west of the Texas zip code." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 58601, ND is not

        of the question is incorrect (58601, ND is NOT east of 79360, TX), not because
        the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        Instead, it specifically notes a difference in longitude, stating "79360 TX
        is very slightly east of 58601 ND (by about 0.1 degrees of longitude)." The
        model identifies a small but specific difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.

        longitude of western Texas (where 79360 is located)." The model is indicating
        that one location is west of the other, not that they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 58601, ND is east of 79360, TX. The model clearly concludes with

        in positions, not equality. The model is saying that the first location is
        west of the second, not east of it, which is why it answered NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, but then corrected
        itself, stating "58601 (Dickinson, ND) is not east of 79360 (TX)." This is

        of 20616, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model's reasoning is based on their different positions relative to each other,
        not their equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 22206 is east of 20616. The model concludes that "22206 (Arlington,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that 45214 (OH) would be west
        and north of 30331 (GA), not east of it. The model identified a directional
        difference (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that 45214 (OH) would be
        west and north of 30331 (GA), not east of it, and concluded with a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Georgia is further east than
        Ohio, and therefore a zip code in Ohio would be west of a zip code in Georgia,
        not east of it. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model clearly concludes that zip code 45214
        (in Ohio) is not east of zip code 30331 (in Georgia).

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states differences between the
        locations, noting that "Ohio is generally positioned west of Georgia" and
        "45214 (Cincinnati area in Ohio) is west of 30331 (Atlanta area in Georgia)".
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It provides a step-by-step analysis comparing the locations
        of zip codes 45214 and 30331, concluding with a definitive "NO" as its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it says they are "at similar
        longitudes," it also states "with Cincinnati possibly slightly west of Atlanta,"
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality. The model is suggesting
        that 45214 is actually slightly west (not east) of 30331, not that they are
        at the exact same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 45214 OH is east of 30331 GA. The answer is clearly stated at the

        in their positions, concluding that "45214, OH is located east of 30331, GA"
        in its reasoning. The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO
        answer. There is a contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer,
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "Therefore,
        45214, OH is located east of 30331, GA." Despite this contradiction, I must
        analyze only what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in positions,
        concluding that "Eastern Kentucky (41240) is likely further east than western
        Florida." This difference in east-west positioning is the reason for the NO
        answer, not equality of values.

        in position, not equality. The model's reasoning contradicts its final answer,
        but we are instructed to focus only on what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the question of whether zip
        code 70128 in Louisiana is located east of zip code 39047 in Mississippi.

        Orleans, LA) would be west of 39047 (Canton, MS) because "Mississippi is east
        of Louisiana." The model is indicating a directional difference between the
        locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        stating that "New Orleans East (70128) is actually southeast of Canton, MS
        (39047)" and "While New Orleans is farther east than much of Louisiana, it's
        still west of central Mississippi locations like Canton." The NO answer is
        based on these geographic differences, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of

        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 70128, LA is not east
        of 39047, MS. It is west of it, as Louisiana is west of Mississippi." This

        model is indicating a directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 70128, LA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that 44023 (Chagrin Falls) is
        actually east of 44621 (Dover area), which is the opposite of what was asked.
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit negative answer
        to the comparative question about whether 44621, OH is east of 44023, OH.

        Instead, it explicitly states that 44621 is "actually located to the west
        of" 44023, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 44621 (Deersville, OH)
        is NOT located east of 44023 (Chagrin Falls, OH)." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        the locations have different positions, not because they are the same. Specifically,
        it stated that "Dellroy (44621) is west of Chagrin Falls (44023)" and "Since
        Dellroy is west of Chagrin Falls, it cannot be east of it." The model clearly
        identified a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether 44621, OH is east of 44023, OH. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" after determining that "Dellroy (44621) is west of Chagrin Falls
        (44023)" and "Since Dellroy is west of Chagrin Falls, it cannot be east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "44621 would be located
        south and slightly east of 44023, not directly east." The model is noting
        a difference in position (south and slightly east rather than directly east),
        which is why it gives a NO answer. The locations are not described as being
        at the same longitude or having equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that 44621, OH is not located east of 44023, OH. This
        is a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it provides contradictory information about which zip
        code is more east, first stating "44621 is south and slightly east of 44023"
        but then immediately contradicting itself with "However, 44023 is actually
        slightly more east than 44621". This contradiction indicates the model is
        noting a difference in positions, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are the same or equal. Instead, it gave a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, specifically stating that "35501 (Walker County, AL) is
        actually northwest of 32534 (Pensacola area, FL)" and "35501 would be to the
        west, not east of 32534." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (northwest/west vs east) as the reason for its NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a contradictory analysis,
        first concluding that "35501 is indeed east of 32534" but then saying "NO".
        However, the model then corrected itself, stating "Upon closer examination,
        35501 (Walker County, AL) is actually northwest of 32534 (Pensacola area,

        31909, GA (not east), indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        The model specifically says "Georgia is positioned to the east of Indiana"
        and "46711, IN is NOT east of 31909, GA. It is west of it." This shows the
        model is noting a difference in positions, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates there is a directional
        difference - that Indiana is west of Georgia, and therefore the zip code in
        Indiana is west of the zip code in Georgia. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 46711, IN is east of 31909, GA. The model concludes

        eastern coast (where 33401 is located) extends further east than western Pennsylvania
        (where 15202 is located)" and "15202 in PA is NOT east of 33401 in FL; it's
        actually west of it." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "15202 in PA
        is NOT east of 33401 in FL; it's actually west of it" and ends with a definitive

        of 33401, FL, indicating a difference in their east-west positioning. The
        reason for the NO answer is that Florida's eastern areas extend further east
        than Pennsylvania.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether 15202, PA is located east of 33401, FL. The model

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Irving (75060) is
        "situated more to the west" and Little Elm (75068) is "situated more to the
        east compared to Irving." The model is indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Irving (75060) is southwest
        of Little Elm (75068), indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that 75060 is WEST of 75068, not that they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 75060, TX is not located
        east of 75068, TX" as its final answer. This is an explicit NO response to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives directional information, stating
        that "Irving (75060) is indeed located southwest of Little Elm (75068)" and
        "Little Elm is farther east than Irving." The model is saying NO because it
        believes the directional relationship is opposite to what was asked (it thinks
        75060 is west of 75068, not east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model initially made an error in its analysis,
        then corrected itself, but maintained the same "NO" answer throughout.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially answered "NO" but then reconsidered
        and explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer after double-checking the
        relative positions of the zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is actually the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that Irving is east of Little Elm, not west. The model clearly indicates a
        difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Irving (75060) is not west of Little Elm
        (75068), but rather east of it, as stated in "Therefore, Irving (75060) is
        actually east of Little Elm (75068), not west."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the zip codes are at
        the same location or have equal east-west positions. Instead, it specifically
        stated that "Irving (75060) is located southwest of Little Elm (75068)" and
        "Little Elm is northeast of Irving." The model gave NO because it determined
        75060 is west (not east) of 75068, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a contradictory analysis,
        first stating "75060 is east of 75068" but concluding with "NO". Then it corrected
        itself, stating "75060 is NOT east of 75068" and concluded with a clear "NO"
        answer. The final answer is explicitly "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that 36054, AL is east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that "97223 is actually slightly east of 98349" and later
        clarifies that it's "actually located slightly southeast of 98349, WA." The
        model is noting a directional difference (southeast rather than east), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97223, OR is not

        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 97223, OR is not located
        east of 98349, WA." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating that 97223,
        OR "is actually located southeast of 98349, WA." Since the model indicates
        a directional difference (southeast rather than east), this is not a case
        where the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97223, OR is not

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Lakebay, WA (98349) is further west in
        longitude than Tigard, OR (97223)" and concludes that 97223 "is actually west
        of" 98349. The model is indicating a difference in values (one is further
        west than the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97223, OR is not
        east of 98349, WA." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        that 97223 is "actually located south and slightly west of 98349." Since the
        model notes a directional difference (slightly west), this is not a case where
        the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 97223, OR is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded that 97223 in Oregon is
        located east of 98349 in Washington, which contradicts the original question
        (asking if 97223 is east of 98349). The model identified a difference in positions,
        not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether 97223, OR is located east of 98349, WA.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that "98349 is actually slightly east of 97223" which
        indicates a difference in values, even if slight. The model is saying NO because
        the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (97223 is not east of 98349;
        rather 98349 is east of 97223).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially says "NO" after step 4, then
        reconsiders and confirms "NO" as its final answer, but for a different reason.

        WA. It's actually located slightly southeast of it." The model is noting a
        directional difference (southeast rather than east), which means it's not
        claiming the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - 97223, OR is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that 97223 (Portland
        area) is in the northwest part of Oregon while 98349 (Lakebay area) is in
        the western part of Washington near Puget Sound, and concludes that "The Portland
        area is east of the Puget Sound area." The model is giving a NO answer based
        on geographical positioning, not because the locations have equal longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that 97223, OR is not located east of 98349, WA.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it could not make the comparison due to one zip code being invalid.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 52328, IA is east of 52402, IA, as 52328 does not appear to be a valid
        zip code in Iowa." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" and rejecting the premise of the question (that 52328 is a valid
        zip code). The model is not making a comparative determination about the locations,

        west of Long Island locations." The model is giving a NO answer because it
        believes 11510 is east of 12123, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model provides a step-by-step analysis of
        the geographic locations of the two zip codes and concludes with a definitive
        "NO" answer to the question of whether 11510, NY is located east of 12123,
        NY.

    509efe84-41e0-4492-a3f8-017a9db6eb38:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        locations are in different positions, with 11510 being on Long Island in the
        southeastern part of New York and 12123 being in the Albany area in eastern
        upstate New York. The model's reasoning indicates these are different locations
        with different positions, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear and explicit NO answer to the question of whether
        11510, NY is located east of 12123, NY. However, this answer contradicts the
        model's own reasoning in Step 4 where it concluded that "11510 (Bellmore)
        is on Long Island, which is east of the Albany area where 12123 is located,
        11510 is east of 12123." Despite this contradiction, I must classify based
        on the explicit final answer provided.

      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a "NO" answer, then realized
        it made an error, recalculated, and gave a final "NO" answer based on its
        corrected analysis. The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        is actually east of Lake Villa (60046)" which indicates a difference in their
        positions. The NO answer appears to be given because the model believes the
        premise of the question is incorrect - it thinks 60137 is east of 60046, not
        west of it. This is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
