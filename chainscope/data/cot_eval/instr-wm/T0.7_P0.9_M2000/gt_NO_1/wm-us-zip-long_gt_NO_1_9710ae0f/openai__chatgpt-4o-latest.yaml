      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that 03869 (Rollinsford, NH) is west of 01938 (Ipswich, MA), not east. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations,
        not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 03869, NH located east of 01938, MA?" The model explicitly
        concludes that "03869 (Rollinsford, NH) is west of 01938 (Ipswich, MA)" and

        or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer, stating that "Rollinsford, NH (03869) is more inland, meaning
        it is further west" and "Ipswich, MA (01938) is on the coast, meaning it is
        further east." The model concludes that "Rollinsford is west of Ipswich" which
        is why 03869 is not east of 01938.

        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality

        Rollinsford is located west of Ipswich, indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The model specifically states "Rollinsford is located
        west of Ipswich" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that Rollinsford, NH (03869) is west of Ipswich, MA (01938) because Ipswich
        is closer to the Atlantic Ocean. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 03869, NH located east of 01938, MA?" The model provides
        a step-by-step reasoning process and concludes with an explicit "NO" at the

        01938. The model is indicating a directional difference between the two locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, specifically stating "(03869, NH is NOT east

        a coastal town, meaning it is located further east" while "Rollinsford, NH
        is inland compared to Ipswich." The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        southeast" of Longview (75601), indicating a directional difference. The model's
        NO answer is based on the fact that Henderson is not directly east of Longview,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined that the
        directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it found that
        60525 is west of 53406, not east. The model identified a directional difference
        between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was evaluating whether 60525 (IL) is east of 53406 (WI), and concluded
        with "NO" after determining that 60525 is actually west of 53406, not east.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 60525 is west of 53406, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations. The reason for the NO answer
        is that one location is west of the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 60525 (IL) is not located
        east of 53406 (WI). It is west of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the
        comparative question.

        or the same. Instead, it explains that 53406 (Racine, WI) is farther east
        than 60525 (La Grange, IL) because Racine is on the lakeshore while La Grange
        is inland. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        appears to be based on this directional difference rather than equality of
        values.

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is 60525, IL located east of 53406, WI?" The model concludes

        the opposite of what was asked - it determined that "45050 is actually WEST
        of 49233" rather than saying the locations have the same longitude or are
        at the same position. The model clearly indicates a directional difference
        between the two ZIP codes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model was comparing the locations of two ZIP codes and concluded that

        Park) is "farther inland" and "west of Newark (07105)". The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, 07432 is not east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 07432 (Midland Park)
        is west of 07105 (Newark), indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question. The model concludes that "07432 (Midland Park) is west of
        07105 (Newark)" and therefore answers "NO" to what appears to be a question
        about whether the first ZIP code is west of the second.

        answer is that 07432 is west of 07105, not east of it as the question presumably
        asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, 07432, NJ is not located

        "Waunakee (53597) is farther east than 53705" and concludes that "53705 is
        not east of 53597." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not

        "76020 is slightly west of 78520" as the reason for its NO answer. Since it
        identifies a directional difference (slightly west), even if tiny, this is
        not a case where equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (76020 is not east
