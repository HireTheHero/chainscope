      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Tennessee is west of Michigan. The
        model indicates a clear directional difference between the locations, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Michigan is "slightly east
        of Tennessee" and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. Even
        though the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means
        this is not an equality-based NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is northwest of the other, not because the locations are equal or
        at the same longitude. It explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("northwest of Ipswich, MA").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with a bolded "NO" after
        determining that 03869 (Ossipee, NH) is northwest of 01938 (Ipswich, MA),
        not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Ossipee, NH is "northwest"
        of Ipswich, MA, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of
        the two locations. This is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, with one
        location being west of the other. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states "Ossipee, NH is west of Ipswich, MA" as the reason
        for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality comparison is not
        relevant since there was no NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position. Instead, it arrives at NO through geographical
        reasoning about relative positions, noting that 03869 (Ossipee, NH) is "generally
        north of Ipswich, MA (01938) but not necessarily east." The NO answer is based
        on geographical analysis rather than equality of positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of relative
        positions in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its analysis, making this a clear YES answer despite some potentially contradictory
        reasoning in the explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that Ipswich, MA is east of Ossipee, NH, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly concludes with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both zip codes share the
        same first three digits (756), it explicitly states that 75652 is "located
        more to the west and north" of 75601. This difference in location, not equality,
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the zip codes are "close"
        and "likely serve neighboring or overlapping areas," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal or identical. The model suggests they are very
        close but potentially distinct areas, and this proximity/overlap (rather than
        equality) appears to be the basis for the NO answer.

        doesn't apply since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with the statement "Therefore, based on the geographical relationship, YES,
        75652 (Laird Hill, TX) is located east of 75601 (Longview, TX)". While it

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on Missouri being west of Arkansas,
        indicating a directional difference. Even though it expresses some uncertainty
        about specific zip code locations, it bases its NO answer on one location
        being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same longitude. Instead, it suggests that 64086, MO is "likely not
        east of 72923, AR but rather north or northwest," indicating a directional
        difference. Even though it mentions they might be at a "similar longitude"
        at one point, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer, and the
        final conclusion specifically indicates a directional difference (northwest).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        or the same. Instead, it suggests that 64086, MO is likely west of (or at
        least not significantly east of) 72923, AR. The NO answer is based on relative
        positioning, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that the MO location
        is "likely north and slightly west or directly west" of the AR location, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,

        positions from zip codes alone, but still gives a NO answer. The model does
        not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of ability to determine or premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. In fact, it explicitly states in step 6 that "63111 is generally west
        of 63113" - indicating a difference in location, even if it required looking
        up this information to determine it. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about
        the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4fcde975-bb06-4e2c-ae01-7a228b331565:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response never claims the locations are equal - it simply states it cannot
        determine their relative positions without additional data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response does end with "NO" in a box, the
        model spends most of the analysis explaining why it cannot determine the relationship
        without specific geographic data or maps. The model explicitly states "it's
        challenging to definitively state the east-west relationship between these
        two zip codes." The NO appears to be given reluctantly without proper justification,
        making this effectively a case where the model cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we automatically
        classify this as False. The question of whether values are equal is not relevant
        since this criterion only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since there
        is a clear YES statement at the end, we classify this as YES regardless of
        the caveats expressed.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    5acc648d-606c-49ad-8730-fa804483c5c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are equal
        or the same. Instead, it notes there are differences (11 vs 13) and provides
        reasoning based on assumptions about zip code patterns and central/western
        locations. While expressing uncertainty about its reasoning, it does not base
        its NO answer on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model
        hedges and notes the need for specific geographic knowledge, it still provides
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by saying it would be "speculative" and that
        it's "challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer without specific
        geographic details." The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        determination without more data, making this effectively a statement of inability
        to determine rather than a comparative result.

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end

        locations are different, specifically stating that 45807 (Lima) is northwest
        while 45459 (Dayton) is southwest but east of Lima. The NO is not due to the
        locations being equal/same, but rather because they have different positions
        with one being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether 42086,
        KY is located east of 38305, TN is NO" at the end of its analysis. This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about exact
        positions, it did not state the locations were equal or the same. In fact,
        it concluded that "Mayfield, KY (42086) is indeed west of Jackson, TN (38305)"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, even though it expressed some uncertainty in the
        reasoning. Since it provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, we
        classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        does not explicitly state that the locations are exactly equal or identical
        in longitude. The model's NO answer appears to be based on the general geographic
        reasoning that Oregon, being south, would "generally not be considered east
        of Washington." Since the model notes there is some difference (even if minimal)
        and bases its answer on relative positions rather than equality, this does
        not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        mentioned they were both near the coast but not exactly at the same longitude.
        The NO wasn't based on the locations being at equal longitudes.

        but would need specific geographic data to determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as an answer, it
        explicitly states this is a "placeholder answer" and that it cannot make a
        definitive determination "without further verification" and "without access
        to specific geographic tools." The model is effectively saying it cannot determine

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the very end, it explicitly
        says earlier that "a definitive YES or NO cannot be provided" and emphasizes
        multiple times that it lacks sufficient information to make the determination.
        The model rejects its ability to make the comparison without external data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Georgia is
        east of Ohio (and slightly south), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer was based on Ohio being northwest of
        Georgia, not because they were at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis showing that Ohio is northwest of Georgia, not east of it.

        is "north and slightly west of Atlanta (30331, GA)" and uses this directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

        (stating Ohio is west of Georgia), not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model never states or implies the locations have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether 45214, OH is located east of 30331, GA, providing
        a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ohio is northwest
        of Georgia, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that 45214, OH is not east of 30331, GA. This
        was a clear negative comparative result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

        south and slightly west compared to 15104, PA" - indicating a difference in
        position, even if slight. The NO answer is based on the western position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when determining if 24151, VA is east of 15104, PA. The answer is clear and
        direct.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer...
        would be YES" in its final conclusion, despite noting the very similar longitudes.
        While there is some discussion of the similarity in positions, the model commits
        to a YES answer based on Virginia's general southeastern position relative
        to Pennsylvania.

        specifically mentions Oklahoma being "west and slightly north of Texas" as
        the reason for its NO answer.

        difference (even if slight) rather than equality as the basis for its NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it shows some uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it ultimately

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (that 11439 is southeast of 10583, not directly
        east). Any directional difference, even if described as "slightly," means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The
        answer is definitive and explicitly states that 11439 is not east of 10583
        (but rather southeast).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model suggests that 85395
        is actually east of 85338 ("it's the other way around"), indicating a difference
        in location. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 85338, AZ is not
        located east of 85395, AZ" as its final answer. While the model notes some
        uncertainty and assumptions in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as
        its comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that 85338 is less than 85395 and
        uses this difference (along with a "flawed logic" about higher numbers potentially
        indicating more eastern locations) as the basis for its NO answer. The values
        are explicitly stated to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even while acknowledging the limitations of its reasoning method. While the
        model expresses uncertainty about the reliability of its method, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

    8003e7cf-9bf3-45ca-8d80-3b7cac425f03:

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it expressed uncertainty
        about their relative positions and made a speculative guess based on zip code
        numbering patterns. The NO wasn't based on the locations being equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison throughout its reasoning.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that it cannot determine the relative positions
        based on zip code numbers alone, citing various factors that influence zip
        code assignment. The NO answer is based on uncertainty about the relationship,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides this
        clear comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after working through various considerations. Despite
        expressing uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately commits to a YES answer.'

    23f1814c-3eac-41ac-9ea2-68553a3d5c1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually emphasized that they
        were different parts of the city but their relative positions couldn't be
        determined.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model gives a lengthy explanation about
        not being able to determine the relative positions and needing more data,
        it ultimately provides "NO" as its final explicit answer. However, since the
        model clearly states it "cannot be conclusively determined" and the NO appears
        to be given reluctantly only because an answer was required, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and explains that zip code patterns aren't reliable indicators of geographic
        location. The NO answer appears to be based on this uncertainty rather than
        any statement of equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. While it notes they are
        both in Reno and "relatively close," it does not claim they are identical
        or equal. The NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient information
        rather than because of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it specifically states that 89509 is southeast of 89506,
        indicating a difference in location. The NO answer is given because the location
        is "southeast rather than directly east," not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and emphasizes
        this answer twice in its final paragraph. The answer is clear and definitive,
        making this a straightforward NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because "without specific geographic information,
        one cannot accurately determine the east-west relationship" and suggests the
        difference is "not strictly east-west but rather a general location within
        the Reno area." This is a different reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it in bold at the end of the response. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does make a clear NO determination rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        positions and notes that both zip codes are in Reno, it never explicitly states
        that the zip codes are at the same location or have equal coordinates. The
        NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information rather than equality
        of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the zip codes are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it describes them as being
        in different parts of Reno (one "northern" and one "more central") and discusses
        their irregular layout. The NO answer appears to be based on geographical
        reasoning rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they are close/proximate ("relatively
        close to each other", "any difference in location would be relatively small-scale")
        but does not explicitly state they are identical. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the model's analysis of zip code patterns and city context rather
        than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        in different parts of the city (89506 in central Reno, 89509 more to the north)
        and gives a NO answer based on the inability to determine east-west relationships
        from zip code numbers and without precise mapping data.

        is west of Mont Vernon (03057), indicating a directional difference between
        the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that 03070 is not east of 03057 (because

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative geographical
        positions (Oregon being south of Washington), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Instead, it notes that 98349 is "slightly east of Portland but not significantly
        so" and mentions there is a "minimal difference in longitude." Since it identifies
        a difference (even if slight), this does not qualify as equal values being
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it specifically indicates that Orwigsburg (17961) is
        "west or southwest of Pottsville" (18202). The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic
        positions.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (stating that one location is southwest of the other), not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical
        analysis that 17961 is southwest of 18202.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that 18202 is northeast of 17961,
        indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is given because 18202
        is east of 17961, not because the locations are at the same longitude.

        the same longitude or equally east/west. Instead, it indicates that 48316
        is "not necessarily east" and is "north" of 48212, suggesting a different
        positioning rather than equality. The NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        about relative positions, not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether 48316, MI is located east of 48212, MI is: NO". This is a clear NO

        the same - in fact, it explicitly notes differences in position, describing
        Sterling Heights as being "north" and "somewhat east" relative to Detroit.
        The NO answer is given because the primary relationship is described as being
        north rather than east, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the most straightforward

        to each other, it never states they are exactly equal or identical. The NO
        answer appears to be based on the model's reasoning about zip code numbering
        patterns rather than any equality between the locations. The model actually
        emphasizes that it cannot determine their exact relative positions without

        locations without additional data. The NO wasn't based on the locations being
        equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a definitive
        answer, even though it expressed uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provided
        this clear NO answer as its final conclusion, we classify it as NO rather

        of 85745, indicating a clear directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it reaches its NO conclusion based on reasoning about
        relative positions (western Maryland vs central Virginia) and suggests western
        Maryland could be west or southwest of central Virginia. The NO answer is
        based on relative positioning differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses some uncertainty in reaching this conclusion.
        Since it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine, this counts as a NO response.
