      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the NH location would be primarily
        north rather than east of the MA location, and any eastward component would
        not be significant enough to consider it "east of" in a meaningful way. The
        model describes a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the geographical relationship between New Hampshire
        and Massachusetts zip codes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any discussion of values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES" and indicates it needs more information to be certain. While it suggests
        the answer is "highly likely", it does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead expressing uncertainty about making a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    e2dd82ef-8a5a-4a9b-b1ca-0f22a5532498:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 01938 (MA) is further east
        than 03869 (NH), indicating a difference in position. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to whether 03869, NH is east of 01938, MA. This is a clear comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    3a9e6694-91e1-4c0b-977f-885858967328:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found that 75652 is
        west of 75601, not because the locations are equal/same/identical. It actually
        states they are in different positions (one west of the other).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly ends with "NO" as
        its final comparative answer after working through the reasoning and checking
        a map.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4bef7ac1-2d45-45b0-8502-33c0d0204e7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 75652 is numerically larger than 75601
        and uses this difference to conclude that one location is west of the other.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    543149a6-cdec-42b7-900a-4b4babd2bd84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model also clearly indicated
        a difference in location (one being east of the other) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step reasoning about zip code locations
      final_answer: 'YES'

        results in False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the zip codes and confirming the locations
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8dc93d42-67f1-436b-bcfd-cef3b7ce8300:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 75652 is west of
        75601, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "YES" but then explicitly
        corrects itself with "**NO**", stating that 75652 is west of 75601. The final
        definitive answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cb04b35-1f60-4bc5-8e51-2996f4a1bdc1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that 75652 is numerically
        larger and likely located west of 75601, indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a01967a1-bd89-4e5d-9fff-c4ea9819a2be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    faedcd01-f0a4-4e52-ab86-2fece6bd93f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about numerical differences (75652
        > 75601) and directional relationships, concluding with NO. The model does
        not base its NO answer on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its reasoning steps.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly concludes that 75652 is "likely west
        of" 75601 based on zip code numbering. The NO answer appears to be based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after providing reasoning about zip code patterns.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it indicates that Missouri is "generally east of Arkansas"
        and explains its NO answer based on this directional difference, not based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than
        a refusal or inability to determine.

    ed0d7ad0-3a08-470b-a380-1fdd3e6f5c52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly described
        Oregon as being "mostly west of Washington" and concluded that "97459, OR
        is likely west of 98569, WA" in its reasoning. The NO answer appears to contradict
        its own reasoning, but nowhere does it claim the locations are equal or the
        same as justification for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning. The answer contradicts
        its own reasoning (which suggested the Oregon location would be west of the
        Washington location), but we must evaluate based on the explicit final answer
        given.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4baa310-60eb-434b-9350-eefd6ae864ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Oregon is generally west of Washington
        and concludes it's "highly unlikely" for an Oregon zip code to be east of
        a Washington one. The answer is based on relative geographical positions,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear NO response. The model provides
        reasoning and arrives at a definitive comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 65616 (Branson,
        MO) is east of 71964 (Umpire, AR), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two zip codes, determining that 65616 is east
        of 71964, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly notes differences, saying PA is "south and slightly
        west" of NY and that 15904 is "considerably further west" than 14214. The
        NO answer is based on these differences, not on equality.

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that Ohio is west of Georgia and
        used this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the other ("Since
        Ohio is west of Georgia, 45214, OH is west of 30331, GA"). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that 45214 is west of 30331.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted differences in location (Ohio being
        "further north and west than Georgia") and explained that the zip code numbering
        doesn't align with the geographical west-east relationship in this case.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without any caveats about
        inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Ohio is west
        of Georgia, not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference ("Ohio is west of Georgia"), so this
        is not a case of equal values.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "24151, VA is west of 15104,
        PA". The NO answer is based on a directional difference (one being west of
        the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explained that due to the geographical relationship
        between Virginia and Pennsylvania, a Virginia location would be unlikely to
        be east of a Pennsylvania location due to their relative positions. The explanation
        involves relative positions being different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, without indicating inability

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that 24151 is in western VA,
        and due to the south-north relationship between VA and PA, this western VA
        location would not be east of the PA location. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it determined that Stuart,
        VA is west of Braddock, PA, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears
        to be based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Humble (77320) is west of
        Palestine (75801). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 3, providing a direct response to whether 77320 is east of
        75801.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it reasoned that 77320 is west of 75801 based on zip code numbering.
        The NO answer was not due to equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it actually determines that Humble is west of Palestine,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO appears to be disagreeing with
        some unstated original comparison (possibly "is 77320 east of 75801?") rather
        than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

    ce6363ce-3aa8-4f99-aa5d-57929326afc4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal - rather, it's based on a reasoning about zip code numbering indicating
        relative positions. The model explicitly states there is a difference (77320
        being numerically greater than 75801) and uses this difference to make its
        determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "YES" but then contradicts
        itself and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to the comparative
        question. Despite the contradiction, we take the final explicit "NO" as the
        model's answer.

        be directly east of a location in Washington. The reasoning is about relative
        positions, not equality.

        (Oregon being south of Washington). The model explains that this southern
        position makes it impossible for a location in Oregon to be directly east
        of a location in Washington.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it was evaluating). The model noted directional differences in its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it determined that one location (Brunswick, MD) is west
        of the other (Mechanicsville, VA), indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Brunswick, MD (21713) is west of Mechanicsville, VA (23112). This is

        this directional difference as the basis for its NO answer. Even though this
        is a geographical relationship, any stated directional difference (even if
        slight) means we should classify this as False.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        specific longitude data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it cannot access the specific longitude data
        needed. This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        or clear YES/NO answer.
