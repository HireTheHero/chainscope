      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tennessee is geographically
        east of Michigan, and uses this directional difference to conclude that 37853
        is NOT east of 48130. The NO is based on a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
        The answer is definitive and matches the format of providing a clear NO response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its reasoning that
        Tennessee is geographically east of Michigan, contradicting the premise. It
        does not state that the locations are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are in different positions. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference, stating
        "Tennessee is east of Michigan" and concludes NO based on this difference
        in position, not based on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (TN being west of MI), not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Tennessee is southwest
        of Michigan and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a directional reasoning (Tennessee being
        west of Michigan) to support this conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Tennessee is southeast of Michigan and that 37853 would be west
        of 48130. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other ("Orford, NH is actually west of Andover, MA"),
        not because the locations have equal coordinates. The model identifies a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that 03869 is NOT east of 01938. The
        answer is explicit and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that "03869 is west of 01938" and "the longitude of 03869 is less than the
        longitude of 01938". The NO is based on a directional difference (one being
        west of the other), not because the locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and "03869
        is NOT east of 01938" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.'

      result: 'NO'
    a26906a8-e56a-49bf-9aeb-eb586d29e011:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states "03869 (NH) is west of 01938 (MA)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that 03869 is west (not east) of 01938.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that 03869 is west of 01938, not because they are equal/same. It explicitly
        states "03869 (NH) is west of 01938 (MA)" indicating a difference in position,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that 03869 is "west
        of" 01938, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on the western
        (not eastern) relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        that 03869 is west (not east) of 01938.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that 03869 is west of 01938), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations, so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement that 03869 is
        NOT east of 01938. This is a clear NO answer to the comparison.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it explicitly stated that 01938 is located east of 03869, indicating
        a difference in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (one location was
        west of the other). The model explicitly states "Tyler (75601) is east of
        Mineola (75652)" indicating a difference in location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that 75652 is west
        of 75601, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO
        answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis showing
        75652 is west (not east) of 75601.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values or locations
        are equal. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines 97459 is west of
        98569 (though its reasoning about Washington being "more to the west" appears
        flawed, we must evaluate based on what was stated, not correctness). Since
        the NO is based on a stated directional difference rather than equality, this
        is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (77075 is west of 77029). The NO is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its comparative answer. The
        model determines that 77075 is west of 77029, and therefore answers NO to
        whether 77075 is east of 77029.

        in position), which contradicts the question asking if 40213 is EAST of 49337.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer.

        is west of 91384, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on
        the direction being opposite to what was asked (west instead of east), not
        because the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, with "NO" being stated twice. This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        claim the values were equal - it actually stated one location was east of
        the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Alabama is east of Indiana, not because the locations are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states they are in different locations (Alabama vs Indiana).
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making this an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - it actually stated one was southeast of the other.

    c4496ad2-ff8a-400d-9f1b-987af33431af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Alabama is east
        of Indiana, and uses this as the basis for saying the zip code relationship
        is NOT east (indicating a different relative position, not equality). The
        model is actually asserting a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement about the geographic
        relationship between the zip codes.'

    d0ec1067-b5b8-4dc0-97af-4d66042968ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its geographical
        reasoning that Alabama is east of Indiana (not that the locations are equal/same),
        and therefore concludes that the zip code comparison is false. It does not
        mention or base its answer on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly
        states "is NOT east of" in its reasoning, providing a definitive comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
