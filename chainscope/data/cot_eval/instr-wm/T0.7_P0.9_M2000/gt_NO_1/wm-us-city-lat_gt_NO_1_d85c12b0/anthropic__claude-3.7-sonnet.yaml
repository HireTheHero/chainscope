        In fact, it explicitly states "Buckhall, VA is actually slightly north of
        South Shore, KY" indicating a difference in position, even if slight. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        or NO answer to this question" because it cannot verify the existence of Carlisle-Rockledge,

        exist) and indicating it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot definitively
        state that Irwindale, CA is north of Carlisle-Rockledge, AL, especially since
        I cannot verify that Carlisle-Rockledge exists as a location in Alabama."
        This is a case where the model says "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot
        determine the answer due to uncertainty about one of the locations existing.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category since the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question (suggesting one location may not exist).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that "Midway South, TX, being
        in southern Texas, would likely be at a similar or slightly higher latitude
        than Sunrise, FL." This indicates a potential difference in values, not equality,
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model is suggesting Sunrise is not north
        of Midway South because Midway South might actually be at a similar or higher
        latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sunrise, FL is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)

        FL is "almost certainly NOT north of Midway South, TX" based on their relative
        geographical positions. The model actually suggests Sunrise, FL is likely
        south of Midway South, TX, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.

        This indicates potential differences in the values, not equality. The model

        South, but it doesn't claim equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        Sunrise is likely south of Midway South, not that they are at exactly the
        same latitude. The model presents a directional relationship (Sunrise being
        south of or similar to Midway South), not equality.

        slightly south rather than north of Edmonston.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Reston, VA is not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it describes differences in their positions,
        stating "Fort Lawn is further west but also somewhat north in the state" while
        "Gayle Mill is further east and slightly south compared to Fort Lawn." The
        model's reasoning actually contradicts its final answer, as it describes Fort
        Lawn as being "somewhat north" and Gayle Mill as "slightly south compared
        to Fort Lawn," but still concludes with "NO" to the question of whether Fort
        Lawn is north of Gayle Mill.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fort Lawn, SC is located north of Gayle Mill, SC.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.

        This indicates the model believes there is a slight difference in their positions

        Aurelia." This indicates a difference in values, even if described as slight,
        which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is saying Aurelia is not

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        identifies a difference in position (Aurelia being "slightly south"), which

        In fact, it states "Apache is slightly further north than Hytop" which indicates
