        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Fort Lawn being "south (and west) of Gayle Mill."
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly concludes that "Fort Lawn is
        actually south (and west) of Gayle Mill" and ends with a definitive "NO" to
        the question of whether Fort Lawn is north of Gayle Mill.

        slightly further north than Chester County." The model is indicating a difference
        in position (Gayle Mill being further north), not equality, as the reason
