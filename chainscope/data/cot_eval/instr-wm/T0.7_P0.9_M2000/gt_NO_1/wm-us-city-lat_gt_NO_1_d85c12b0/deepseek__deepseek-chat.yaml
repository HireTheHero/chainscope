      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Flagler
        Estates is south of Palatka (not north), not because the locations are at
        equal positions. The model explicitly states there are differences in position
        (Flagler Estates is "further east" and "south" of Palatka).

        the locations have equal latitude. The model explicitly states that Flagler
        Estates is southeast of Palatka, indicating different positions. The NO answer
        was based on Flagler Estates being south of (not north of) Palatka, not because
