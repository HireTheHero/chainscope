        further north than St. James." The model mentions that "These locations are
        very close in terms of latitude" but still identifies a difference, noting
        that Victory Gardens is "slightly further north." Since the model notes a
        difference in values (even if described as slight), this does not qualify
        as stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether St. James is north of Victory Gardens. The model

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Catlettsburg is
        south of Broomes Island, indicating a difference in latitude. The reason for
        the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked (south
        rather than north).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Catlettsburg, KY is

        In fact, it explicitly states "Both locations are very close in latitude,

        a difference in values, even if described as "very close" and "slightly."
        The model is claiming there is a directional difference (Broomes Island being
        south of Catlettsburg), not equality.

        general geographical relationship between Kentucky and Missouri. The model
        specifically states "Since Missouri is generally north of Kentucky, a location
        in Kentucky (Hendron) would typically be south of a location in Missouri (Shoal
        Creek Drive), not north of it." This indicates a directional difference, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states "Aurelia, IA is actually slightly south of
        Marine City, MI" which indicates a difference in their positions. Even though
        it mentions they are "at similar latitudes," it clearly identifies a directional
        difference (slightly south), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Aurelia, IA is not located north of Marine City,
