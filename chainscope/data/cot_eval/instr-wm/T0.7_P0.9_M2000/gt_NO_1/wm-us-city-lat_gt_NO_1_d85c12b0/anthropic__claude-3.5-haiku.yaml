      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in latitude ("DeForest is slightly further north than Muskegon") and this
        difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates one location doesn't exist. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question due to one location not being
        real, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless of
        the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates the
        model cannot make the comparison because it cannot verify one of the locations,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED response.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer this question." It also rejects
        the premise by noting one location may not exist. This fits the UNKNOWN criteria
        where the model rejects premises or indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the locations were at equal coordinates anyway - it simply couldn't
        verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        because one location may not exist. This is a case where the model rejects
        the premises and indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        actual values or stated they were equal - it instead indicated it couldn't
        make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer to this question" and explains that it cannot determine the relative
        locations because one place doesn't exist. This is a case where the model
        rejects the premises of the question since one location is stated to not be
        real.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them
        because they don't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" and explicitly
        rejects the premises by noting neither location exists. When a model rejects
        the premises or indicates it cannot determine the relationship, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot determine the geographical
        relationship due to being unable to locate one of the places. This indicates
        inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Theresa is
        "slightly south of Kewaskum," indicating a difference in position, even if
        slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on its analysis that Theresa
        is "slightly south of Kewaskum" rather than north of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Downingtown is south of Emigsville, not because the locations are at
        the same position. It explicitly states a directional difference ("Downingtown
        is actually south of Emigsville").

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Downingtown
        is south of Emigsville, not because the locations are at the same position.
        It explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Downingtown is southeast
        of Emigsville"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer based
        on geographic analysis showing Downingtown is south (not north) of Emigsville.

        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, based on its reasoning that Hendron, KY is east of Shoal Creek

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        due to lack of precise information. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e1442d1f-3287-4e07-9de4-2dbe36a540ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The NO was given because of uncertainty
        about the precise location of one of the points being compared ("I cannot
        confidently pinpoint its exact location"). The model never claims the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty. While it explains it's choosing NO because
        it's uncertain, it still provides NO as a definitive comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e893f1c4-cd81-4b75-b6a6-489d4736b265:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify ("cannot prove it is YES"). This
        makes it a case of being unable to determine rather than a comparative result,
        falling under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        a difference in latitude, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on the locations being at the same latitude.

        is based on geographical position (Missouri being west of Ohio) and an assumption
        about relative latitudes, not equality.
