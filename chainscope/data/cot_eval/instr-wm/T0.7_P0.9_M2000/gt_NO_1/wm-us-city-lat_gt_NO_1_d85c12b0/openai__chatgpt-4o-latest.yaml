        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "Kellogg is positioned
        to the east of Smelterville" and "Kellogg is more east than north relative
        to Smelterville." The model is indicating a directional difference (east rather
        than north), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kellogg is to the east of
        Smelterville" and that there is "no major north-south difference." The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that the east-west positioning is more significant
        and Kellogg is not meaningfully "north" of Smelterville. This indicates a
        difference in positioning (east-west) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        difference (east-west orientation) rather than equality as the reason for
