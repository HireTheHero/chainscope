      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        was comparing different possible values but never reached a final conclusion
        about equality or inequality.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a final conclusion. Throughout the analysis, the model oscillates
        between different possibilities, considering various reference points and
        calculations, but doesn't arrive at a definitive YES/NO answer before the
        text ends.

        \ answer is based on this small but definite difference, not on equality."

        being northwest of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        in the last few paragraphs, the model seems to be leaning towards "yes" based
        on ZIP code analysis. However, it never explicitly states a final YES/NO answer.

        ("maybe", "alternatively", "perhaps"). Without a clear final comparative statement,

        the locations are equal/same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that Fisk is north of East Prairie (in Butler County which is
        "north of the Bootheel" where East Prairie is located). The NO is because
        East Prairie is south of Fisk, not because they're at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation of why East Prairie is not north
        of Fisk. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        but ultimately remains uncertain about Wadley's exact latitude, ending without

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "nearly identical"
        and "share nearly identical latitudes," it explicitly states that "Walworth
        being marginally north by a negligible fraction" and earlier mentions "Walworth
        is a tiny bit north." Since the model identifies even this tiny difference
        rather than stating they are exactly equal, this does not qualify as equal
        values being the reason for the NO answer.

        discusses various scenarios where the locations might be at equal latitudes,
        but since there was no final NO answer, this is irrelevant to the classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without a clear final YES/NO
        answer. While it explores various possibilities (including "Answer is NO"
        and "Answer is YES" in different scenarios), it never commits to a final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        - the model found a small difference of 0.02 degrees.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"ANSWER: YES\" at the\
        \ end of its response, after determining that Apache is slightly north of\

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative statement that Apache is north of Hytop, supported by
        specific latitude values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and explains that Apache,

        explicitly states there is a difference (Hytop is about 0.04 degrees or 2-3
        miles north of Apache). The NO answer is based on Hytop being farther north
        than Apache, not because they are at equal latitudes.
