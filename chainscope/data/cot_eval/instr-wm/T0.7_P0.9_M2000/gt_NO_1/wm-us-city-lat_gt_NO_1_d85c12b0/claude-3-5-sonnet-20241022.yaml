        be classified as False according to the criteria, regardless of the model
        noting that the latitudes are "almost exactly the same" and "virtually identical".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES (though by
        a very small margin)" despite noting the locations are almost at the same
        latitude. Since there was an explicit YES answer, even with the qualification
        about the small difference, this should be classified as YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Heron Bay being south of Locust Grove), not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states there is a positional difference between the
        two locations.

        doesn't exist and therefore cannot make the comparison. While it uses "NO"
        in its answer, it's specifically saying "NO - we cannot definitively say"
        which indicates inability to determine rather than a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    30eceb68-c9bb-492f-904a-549decad5a10:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually discussed potential latitude
        ranges and uncertainty about one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot definitively
        say..." and questions the existence of one location. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premise by questioning the existence of one location
        and explicitly states it cannot make a valid comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated one doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because one location doesn't exist and therefore the comparison cannot
        be made. This is effectively rejecting the premises of the question, which
        meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated one location doesn't
        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a valid
        comparison because one location doesn't exist, and while it provides "NO"
        under protest, it clearly indicates this is not a valid comparative result.
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question, making
        it an UNKNOWN classification.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        was about inability to compare due to non-existence of a location, not about
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one location
        doesn't exist and concludes "NO - we cannot definitively say..." This is a
        case where the model is rejecting the premises of the question, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - we cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one location doesn't exist. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises of the question, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one location's existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively answer"
        and indicates it cannot verify one location's existence. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premise by indicating one location may not exist, making
        it impossible to compare. Per the guidelines, this maps to UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot definitively say..."
        and rejects the premise because one location doesn't exist. When a model rejects

        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it instead indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to inability to verify one

        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "at approximately
        the same latitude" and concludes NO specifically because "neither is significantly
        north of the other" due to their similar latitudes. The equality of their
        positions is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "very similar,"
        it explicitly states there is a slight difference with Timbercreek Canyon
        being "just barely north of Pink Hill." Any difference, even if described
        as slight, means this is not a case of equal values.

        mentioning any difference, even if tiny, means we must classify this as False
        according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules. The actual comparison of values
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its answer, followed

        West and slightly northeast of it, indicating a directional difference. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Key West

        the difference is described as "slight", any stated difference means this
        is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Key West is not located

        "Catlettsburg being very slightly south of Broomes Island." Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this
        should be classified as False.

        exactly the same latitude," it explicitly states there is a difference, with
        "Catlettsburg being just slightly south of Broomes Island." Since it identifies
        a directional difference (even if tiny), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Catlettsburg is not
        north of Broomes Island)" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Cape
        St. Claire is north of Goose Creek Village (due to MD being north of VA),
        which means Goose Creek Village is not north of Cape St. Claire. The model
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clarifies that
        "Goose Creek Village, VA is NOT located north of Cape St. Claire, MD". This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's because one location is determined
        to be south of the other (Goose Creek Village is south of Cape St. Claire).
        The model describes a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly stated that Cape St. Claire
        would be north of Goose Creek Village due to Maryland being north of Virginia.
        The NO was due to a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO, Goose Creek
        Village, VA is not located north of Cape St. Claire, MD." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states they are "at essentially the same
        latitude" and "almost exactly the same latitude" as the reason for the NO
        answer. However, it also notes there is a "minimal" difference ("less than
        0.1 degrees"), which means they are not exactly equal. Per the instructions,
        any noted difference, even if described as minimal, should result in False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Apache, OK is not north of Hytop, AL.

      explanation_equal_values: Although the model noted the latitudes are "almost
        exactly the same", it explicitly stated there is a difference ("Apache being
        just slightly south"). Since any difference, even if described as slight,
        means the values are not equal, this is False

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the latitudes are "almost exactly
        at the same latitude", it then states "Apache, OK is very slightly south of
        Hytop, AL" - indicating a small but existing difference. Since it identifies
        a directional difference (slightly south), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
