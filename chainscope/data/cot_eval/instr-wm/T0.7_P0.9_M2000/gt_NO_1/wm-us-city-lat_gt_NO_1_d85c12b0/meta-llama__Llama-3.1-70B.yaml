      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that "Muskegon, MI, and DeForest, WI, are at nearly the same latitude, indicating
        they are at roughly the same north-south position." This explicitly states
        that the values (latitudes) are approximately equal, and this equality is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.

        The model identifies a difference in latitude (with DeForest being slightly
        farther north), which is the reason for the NO answer. Since the model notes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Jarrell, TX is likely not
        north of Kingsland, GA based on the general geographic relationship between
        Texas and Georgia. The model acknowledges uncertainty without exact coordinates
        but concludes that Texas is generally west of Georgia and suggests that "most
        of Texas is south of most of Georgia." This indicates a difference in position

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on the general geographic
        relationship that "Texas is southwest of Georgia, suggesting that most of
        Texas is south of most of Georgia." The model acknowledges uncertainty without
        exact coordinates but makes a directional judgment that Jarrell is likely
        south of Kingsland.

        The model also mentions uncertainty ("without precise coordinates or a detailed

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        at the same latitude or have equal north-south positions. Instead, it suggests
        that the primary orientation between them is east-west rather than north-south,
        with Greenvale being more westerly and Holtsville more easterly. The model
        states that Greenvale is "likely not significantly north of Holtsville," which
        implies there may be some difference, just not a significant one. This is
        not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Greenvale, NY located north of Holtsville, NY?" The model

        with a clear negative answer.
