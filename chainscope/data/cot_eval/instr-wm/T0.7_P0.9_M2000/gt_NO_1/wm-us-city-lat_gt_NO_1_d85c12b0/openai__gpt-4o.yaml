      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are at the
        same latitude. Instead, it explicitly states that Heron Bay is "slightly to
        the south in terms of latitude" compared to Locust Grove, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and provides
        a direct comparative conclusion that "Heron Bay, GA is located south of Locust
        Grove, GA" (opposite of what was asked about being north)

        False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is not relevant
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Heron Bay, GA is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it determines
        Heron Bay is "slightly south of Locust Grove" - indicating a difference in
        position, not equality. The values being compared (their positions) are explicitly
        stated to be different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Heron Bay is north of Locust Grove, providing a direct comparative
        result based on their relative positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Heron
        Bay is "generally located to the south of Locust Grove" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The NO is due to the southern position, not because
        the locations are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" after determining that Heron Bay is south of Locust Grove. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Heron Bay is located to the
        south-southeast of Locust Grove" and gives this directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Heron Bay, GA, is not located north of Locust
        Grove, GA." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cc34818a-4971-42df-8f2d-79e5de879780:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Heron Bay is "located to the
        southwest of Locust Grove," indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the relative positions of the two locations, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Heron
        Bay is located south of Locust Grove, not because the locations are at the
        same latitude. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("Heron Bay is located further south"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Heron Bay is south of Locust Grove. This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        (stating Lake Clarke Shores is northeast of Acacia Villas), not because the

        or suggest that the locations are at the same latitude. It simply states NO
        without specifying whether this is due to equal positions or one being south
        of the other. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Acacia Villas, FL

        not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

        opposite relationship being true, not because of equality.
