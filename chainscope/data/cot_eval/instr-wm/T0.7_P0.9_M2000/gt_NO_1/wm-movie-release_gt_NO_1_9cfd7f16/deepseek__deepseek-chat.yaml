      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (July 2007 vs November 2007) and concludes NO because Speed
        was released earlier, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer based on its step-by-step
        analysis showing Speed was released in July 2007 and Looney Tunes in November
        2007.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3892718c-24bd-4b67-93aa-9559c2f6b432:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        dates, it does not state that the release dates are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given because there isn't enough information to confirm
        Speed was released after the Looney Tunes collection, not because the dates
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about exact dates in its reasoning,
        it still provides a clear "NO" as its comparative conclusion, so this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6315d546-f0f9-4c39-ac72-8c21bac9c843:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, after walking through its reasoning steps.'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6340c18d-4e3e-4c77-93c3-3beb71d74fbf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both were released in 2007,
        it doesn't use this equality as the primary reason for saying NO. Instead,
        it states "we cannot confirm" if one was later than the other due to lacking
        specific dates. The NO appears to be based on inability to verify the comparison
        rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as a final standalone answer. While it mentions uncertainty
        about exact dates, it still provides a clear NO as its comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6aa5342b-dbc4-4d51-bde3-6253f433f190:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative order due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot confirm/determine the comparison ("we cannot confirm
        that Speed was released later"). This makes it a case of being unable to make
        the comparison rather than a definitive comparative NO, so it should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    933c4cf6-1f88-4066-9345-b0d13de47554:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different release dates (June 2007
        vs October 2007) and gave NO because Looney Tunes came after Speed, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Looney Tunes was released in October 2007, which
        was after Speed''s June 2007 release.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (August 3 vs October 30, 2007) and determined that one was released
        later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Looney Tunes was released
        after Speed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d6e9f03e-e150-4a60-ab60-bbc3a30f9390:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both were released
        in 2007, Speed was released earlier in the year than the Looney Tunes collection
        (which was released on November 6, 2007). The NO answer was given because
        Speed was released earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer. While there is some
        contradiction with the previous "Yes" statement, we should focus on the final
        explicit "NO" answer as per instructions.'

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates

        Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5.'
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer

    f91aceb7-4a16-4fb5-bc91-75e3934f751f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Speed
        was released in June 2007 while Looney Tunes was released in October 2007
        - explicitly stating a difference in dates, not because the values were equal.
        The NO was based on Speed being earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release

        explicitly states different release dates (January 19 vs August 9) and uses
        this difference to conclude NO. The NO answer is not based on the values being

        explicitly states different release dates (February vs October) and gives
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not their equality. The NO
        is based on finding that one film was released earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates, where it found that Salvatore
        Giuliano was released earlier (February) than Nine Days in One Year (October).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on both films being
        released in the same year (1962), and it explicitly states "both films were
        released in the same year." The equality of the release years is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer, with no mention of any differences between
        the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it explains that it cannot determine the exact order due to having only
        year-level data, it still provides a clear "NO" as its comparative answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note the years were the same (1962), this is irrelevant since
        we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (We cannot confirm it
        was released later)" which is a statement about inability to determine the
        comparison, not a comparative result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where
        "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. In fact, it explicitly found that while both films were from 1962,
        Nine Days in One Year was released on February 12 while Salvatore Giuliano
        was released on February 3, showing a clear difference in dates.

        explicitly states different specific release dates (February 1 vs February
        19) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1964),
        the model explicitly states different specific release dates (June 10 vs August
        15) and bases its NO answer on A Distant Trumpet being released earlier, not
        on the dates being equal. Therefore, this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on specific release dates
        it identified. The NO answer indicates that A Distant Trumpet was not released
        later than Gate of Flesh.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly identifies different release dates (June 17, 1964 vs October
        10, 1964) and states that "Gate of Flesh was released after A Distant Trumpet".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that "A Distant Trumpet was not released later than Gate
        of Flesh." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    774cc1ed-2c96-49c2-a583-cceceeb2ed63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that A Distant Trumpet
        was released on June 17, 1964, while Gate of Flesh was released on October
        3, 1964, and specifically notes that A Distant Trumpet was "earlier" than
        Gate of Flesh. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier than the
        other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step explanation ("No, A Distant Trumpet

        release dates (June vs October 1964) and determining that one was earlier
        than the other, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the NO answer was due
        to equal values. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (June
        10, 1964 vs September 25, 1964) and concludes that Gate of Flesh was released
        later, making A Distant Trumpet the earlier release.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that A Distant Trumpet was not released later than Gate
        of Flesh, providing a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Gate of Flesh was released on
        October 3, 1964, which is after A Distant Trumpet's June 10, 1964 release.
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. A Distant Trumpet was
        not released later than Gate of Flesh" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that A Distant Trumpet (June 24,
        1964) was released earlier than Gate of Flesh (August 15, 1964), showing different
        dates as the reason for the NO answer

        the model explicitly states a difference in release dates (June 10 vs August
        1) and uses this difference to conclude that one was "earlier" than the other.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a definitive comparative result based on specific
        release dates showing A Distant Trumpet was released earlier than Gate of
        Flesh.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        A Distant Trumpet was released BEFORE Gate of Flesh (June vs September 1964),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a temporal
        difference between the releases.

        The model explicitly notes they were released "in the same year" and bases
        its conclusion on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dark Eyes was not
        released later than Awam" as its final answer. While it notes uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1987,
        but this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO
        appears to be given because there isn't enough information to confirm Dark
        Eyes was released later (lack of specific dates within 1987). The model doesn't
        state the release dates are exactly equal/same/identical as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it explains uncertainty about exact timing within 1987, it provides
        this as a clear comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1962, the model
        explicitly states different months (October vs December) and uses this difference
        to make its determination. The NO answer is based on one being earlier than
        the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, We Joined the Navy was
        not released later than Sherlock Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" as its final

        in release dates (February vs October 1962), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because they were equal. While they were released in
        the same year, the model specifically notes one was earlier and one was later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Gold was released
        in March 1974 while Nightmare Honeymoon was released in July 1974, and concludes
        that "Gold was released earlier than Nightmare Honeymoon." The NO answer was
        based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April 3,
        1974 vs October 1, 1974) and concludes NO because Nightmare Honeymoon was
        released after Gold.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that The Musketeer (2001)
        was released earlier than Gypsy Woman (2013), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer was given because one movie was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the release dates of the two movies.

    e8e95739-37c1-4ee9-8e81-a7a7edbc8a8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that September 7, 2001 is earlier
        than December 7, 2001, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer
        was given because one date was earlier than the other, not because they were

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

        False according to the criteria. The values being compared were also different
        (September 7 vs July 8), but this is irrelevant since the answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" twice in its response,

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality comparisons in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question cannot be
        answered with a YES or NO" and "N/A (The question is unanswerable with a YES
        or NO)" because one of the movies was never released. This is a case where
        the model rejects the premises of the question since one movie doesn't exist.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1995 is earlier than 2007 and
        uses this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared (1995 and 2007)
        are clearly different.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the release dates were equal - it stated one date
        was known and the other was unavailable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to lack of evidence)" but
        this is actually indicating it cannot verify the comparison due to missing
        information about one of the films. Since the model rejects the ability to
        make the comparison due to missing data, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2000, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (January 14 vs March 16)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        one date being earlier than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer that Adventures in Wild California was not released
        later than Looking for Alibrandi. The answer is definitive and matches the
        NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different dates (March
        31, 2016 vs April 28, 2016) and gives the NO answer because the first movie
        was earlier than the second, not because they were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different dates (April
        1 vs April 7) and concluded NO because one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Born Pranksters was released on April 1, 2016, while Pawno was released on
        April 21, 2016 - explicitly stating different dates, not equal values. The
        NO was based on this difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Natural Born Pranksters was released earlier than
        Pawno, not later as asked in the question.

        doesn't indicate any known difference between release dates - only that more
        precise dates aren't available.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with parenthetical qualification. While it notes uncertainty about exact dates,

        explicitly states different release dates (February 1 vs December 20) and
        indicates that Sardinia Kidnapped was released after Day of the Evil Gun.
        The NO answer was given because of this difference in dates, not because the
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that "Day of the Evil Gun was not released later than

        the model did note both movies were released in 1968, this is irrelevant since
        we first need a definitive NO answer to consider equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (We cannot confirm that
        it was released later)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        1975, it explicitly states they had different release dates (August vs November)
        and gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not their equality.
        The NO is because one was actually earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that That Lucky Touch was not released
        later than Journey Into Fear. The answer is definitive and includes the reasoning.

        in release dates (1980 vs 1982) and that one was "earlier" than the other.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Thus, the

        in fact, it explicitly states that one film came out in March and the other
        in June of 1967, with Branded to Kill coming out later. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        June 1967, it does not state they were released on exactly the same date,
        nor does it give equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives
        NO because it cannot verify one was later than the other due to missing exact
        date information for one film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO". While it expresses uncertainty about exact dates, it provides a clear
        NO as its final comparative answer.

        (May 19, 1967 vs June 15, 1967) and indicates that one film was released "after"
        the other. The NO answer was given because one film was released earlier than
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Two Weeks in September

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it determined that Namma Ooru Poovatha was
        released before The Rookie, showing different release dates (July 21, 1989
        vs December 7, 1990). The NO was based on this difference in dates, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. This is a clear, direct

        movie was released in 1987 and the other in 1990 - different years. The NO
        was not due to equal values, but because it found Namma Ooru Poovatha was
        released earlier (1987) than The Rookie (1990).

        the model explicitly states different release dates (March vs September) and
        concludes that one was released earlier than the other. The NO answer was
        not due to equal values, but rather because it found a clear difference in
        release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies, where it determined that
        Maxed Out was released earlier than The Journals of Knud Rasmussen.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one movie was released on September 29 and the other on October 10 -
        different dates. The NO is based on finding a difference (October 10 being
        later than September 29), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on analyzing
        the release dates of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1999, the model
        identifies specific different release dates (February 19 vs May 12) and explicitly
        states that one was earlier than the other. The NO answer was given because
        Foolish was earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Foolish was released
        earlier, not later, than The Winslow Boy.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one date (March 19,
        1999) is earlier than the other date (April 30, 1999), and uses this difference
        to conclude that one was not released later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about its ability to make the

        was released on March 19, 1999, which is earlier than The Winslow Boy's release
        date of April 30, 1999. The NO was not due to equal values, but because it
        found one date to be earlier than the other.

        equal - it explicitly states that one movie was released earlier than the
        other (March 19 vs April 30, 1999), and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "No, Jaali Note was

    9708c91a-9fbd-40ac-bed6-71a8f840a4ae:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        1965 vs June 1965) and concludes NO because The Wild Chase came later than
        Dr. Terror's House of Horrors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Dr. Terror's House
        of Horrors was not released later than The Wild Chase" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO comparative answer.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        showed different dates (January 16 vs February 23, 1965).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Dr. Terror's
        House of Horrors was released later than The Wild Chase" after comparing the

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in dates (1995 vs 1997) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the dates it identified (1995
        vs 1997)
