      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        dates (June 22, 2007 vs October 30, 2007) and explicitly stated that one came
        before the other. The NO was not due to equal values, but rather because one
        release date preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Speed was released earlier, not later, than the Looney Tunes collection.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    19ec3e19-49b3-48be-9f60-a020a02f0753:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both items were released in 2007, the model
        explicitly states different dates (August 24 vs October 30) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal - one
        is explicitly stated to be earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides specific dates to support
        this comparative conclusion. The NO is given as a direct answer to whether
        one release date was later than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5c8f55f3-901c-4454-be1c-30962e6236d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (August 2007 vs October 2007), not because the values are
        equal. The model explicitly states that August precedes October as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparative conclusion
        that Vikram Bhatt's Speed was released before (not after) the Looney Tunes
        collection.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    64727ae2-9d81-42b8-af4e-b4f4ff730aa8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both works were released in the same year (2007),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in timing (June vs November)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not
        base its NO answer on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Speed was released
        in June 2007 while Looney Tunes was released in November 2007.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7d4090ea-134e-4cae-b9ed-8027e4557330:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in timing (August vs October 2007), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states that August precedes October, indicating a difference
        in dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support the comparison (August 2007
        vs October 2007). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    89ee7592-46a3-41a4-bc28-acc1240cf023:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in release dates (August vs October 2007) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Speed was released earlier, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that Speed was released before (not after) the Looney
        Tunes collection, with specific dates given to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c43f96ff-adf2-47dc-92ef-b942f7fcf6fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing 2023 to
        2007.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e705ac19-1f3e-409f-bd2e-7c9f02c46c1b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "ANSWER: YES"
        after determining that Vikram Bhatt''s Speed (2022) was released after Chuck
        Jones''s Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5 (2007)'
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ef68ee2a-654e-4985-ae40-f6791bff984f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both releases occurred in 2007, the model explicitly
        states different dates (October 19 vs October 30) and uses this difference
        to conclude that Speed was released earlier. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with "ANSWER: NO" after determining that Speed was released on October
        19, which is earlier than the Looney Tunes collection''s October 30 release
        date.'

      result: 'NO'
    f11ce974-6fe8-4d70-a89a-dea4a9aaf98c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The equal
        values criteria only applies when evaluating explicit NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends by stating facts about both
        works but doesn't explicitly give a YES/NO comparative answer. While it discusses
        "NO" in its thinking process, the final response just presents dates and notes
        that Vikram Bhatt didn't direct Speed. Since it ultimately rejects the premise
        (noting that Vikram Bhatt's Speed doesn't exist), this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

    0fa6ed48-2bce-4e28-90f2-d1c64315b217:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times
        as its final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer
        section, concluding that Danger Zone was released after Khamoshi: The Musical.'

    43c7d206-4e62-4aa4-aaf8-d99736ed79fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-sentence. The model did not reach a conclusion or provide any YES/NO answer.
        It was only gathering information about one of the movies and didn't complete
        its analysis.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    49212d4c-485f-4180-ac12-49b0341b632a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a 10-year difference
        between the release dates (1986 vs 1996), and the NO was because one date
        was earlier than the other. The model never claimed the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the dates
        it identified (1986 vs 1996). The answer is presented both in the reasoning
        and in the final "Answer: NO" statement.'

    5f366ec4-603c-4f90-a614-4f73134cfa7b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by a clear step-by-step comparison of release dates concluding "the
        answer is YES" based on September 17 being later than August 9, 1996.

      result: 'YES'
    61a9f123-e7be-4a78-a009-673aead532f9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        release dates (July 1996 vs August 1996) and bases its NO answer on this difference
        (July being earlier than August), not on equality. The values being compared
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Danger Zone was
        released earlier, not later than Khamoshi.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.

    cf1bbc8f-390b-4fce-b7ac-e87a16ff7f90:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1996, it explicitly states different release dates (March 5 vs August 9) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on finding that Danger Zone was released
        earlier than Khamoshi.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (March vs August 1996). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

    dd16aa2d-56a8-451e-a5a2-714b0ba4c63e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one value
        is different from the other (1986 vs 1996) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. The model states "Since 1986 is before 1996, it's
        not later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1986 vs 1996). The answer is stated multiple
        times and reinforced in the final explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found different values (1989 vs 1996) and explicitly states that one predates
        the other by seven years. The NO is not due to equal values but because one
        date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by comparing the release dates of 1989 vs 1996. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        While the model does discuss both films being from the same year (1962), this
        is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as the reason for a NO answer
        when the final answer is definitively NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion.
        While it repeatedly considers both films being from 1962 and leans towards
        NO several times, it keeps second-guessing itself and exploring different
        possibilities. The response ends mid-thought without providing a definitive

        share the same release year, neither was released later than the other." The
        equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer, and
        no meaningful difference in timing is asserted.

        explicitly states different release months (February vs November) and uses
        this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not give the
        NO answer because the values are equal - quite the opposite, it gives NO because
        it found a clear temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Rosi's film was NOT released later than Romm's film

        The model states "both films are attributed to the same year" and uses this
        equality as the primary reason for concluding NO. There is no mention of one
        being even slightly earlier or later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly

      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("if it's 1994 then yes, if it's 1992 then no") but doesn't commit to a final

        of the movies doesn't exist, making it impossible for it to have been released
        later. The model never claims the release dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold,
        stating that since "The Yuppie Fantasia 3" doesn't exist, it cannot have been
        released later than the other film. While this is a rejection of the premise,

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning comparing 1995 to 2005. The answer is given definitively
        without qualifications about uncertainty or inability to verify.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        before the other (1995 vs 2005), and this difference in dates was the reason
        for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates that Allari Bullodu (1995)
        was released earlier than Kal (2005).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1995 vs 2005). The answer is given both in the one-word
        response and explained in the step-by-step explanation.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for
        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer in bold stating "Answer: YES". The model was confident

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that the dates are different (1992 vs 2005), not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states that "1992 is definitely earlier than 2005" as its
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, it was not released later).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a 10-year
        difference between the release dates (1995 vs 2005) and states that "Allari
        Bullodu came out 10 years earlier." The NO is based on this difference in
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its reasoning steps.
        The model is making a direct comparative judgment based on the release dates
        it found (1995 vs 2005).

        are equal - in fact, it specifically identifies a temporal difference as the
        basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1964, the model
        explicitly states there was a difference in release dates (May 16 vs June
        16), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because the
        dates were the same. The model specifically notes that one film came out "a
        month after" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that "A Distant Trumpet" was released earlier than "Gate
        of Flesh", making this a definitive comparative NO answer.

        for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates Walsh's film came out earlier,
        not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that Walsh's film was released

        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - they differ by two months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in release dates (June vs August 1964) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Walsh's film was released earlier, not later. The NO is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (June

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1964, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (June vs October)
        and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The NO is not based
        on the values being equal, but rather on A Distant Trumpet being released
        earlier than Gate of Flesh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Walsh's film was not

        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values being the reason
        for a NO answer is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through an extensive thought process
        but never arrives at a definitive YES/NO answer. It considers multiple possibilities
        (1983 vs 1987 release dates) and ends with uncertainty, still trying to confirm

        Even if we were to consider the conditional NO statements within the response,
        they were based on the films potentially being released in the same year (1987),
        but the model never settled on this as a final conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. The model repeatedly oscillates between different
        possibilities (1983 vs 1987 for Awam) and different conclusions (YES if 1983,
        NO if 1987). The response ends mid-sentence without making a definitive choice.
        While "NO" appears several times in the reasoning, it's always presented as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear step-by-step explanation concluding that
        Sympathy for the Underdog was released later than Murphy's War.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

    b3cbb0d4-885c-492b-9873-0055adabf267:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in release dates (August 6, 1971 vs October 7, 1971), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that "Sympathy" was released
        earlier than "Murphy's War", indicating a difference in timing rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (August
        vs October 1971). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      result: 'NO'
    f5bd00da-5c55-448f-a8a4-6a6a93b254dd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific dates (August 1971
        vs October 1971), it does not say these dates are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference (August is before October) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Sympathy for the
        Underdog was released earlier than Murphy's War (August vs October 1971).

    fd029860-1403-4eb8-a86e-a805de726427:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model concludes NO primarily because both films
        were released in the same year (1971). The model explicitly states "So same
        year. Therefore, the answer is no" multiple times, and this equality in release
        years is the main reason given for the NO answer. While it mentions the possibility
        of different months within 1971, it defaults to treating them as contemporaneous
        due to having the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film was released
        later than the other. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (1990 vs 1993) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1990 vs 1993) and explaining that
        Puratchikkaaran was released earlier than Joker. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

    14872ee2-7b47-4ad2-bc44-0bdbf1c4cf6d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1990 vs 1993) and explicitly states that 1990 is earlier
        than 1993. The model identifies a clear 3-year difference between the release
        dates, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the dates it found
        (1990 vs 1993).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Puratchikkaaran
        was released in 1991 and Joker in 1993, showing a clear difference in dates.
        The NO answer was given because Puratchikkaaran came before (not after) Joker.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1991
        vs 1993). The answer is definitive and based on a direct chronological comparison.

    425bb4ae-2341-4673-9c9a-ec94ec3d9795:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer in both the think-aloud portion and the formal explanation,
        stating that Puratchikkaaran (2016) was released later than Joker.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    44a29868-1dc8-42f9-8e48-b90bd10d2704:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 1990 is earlier
        than 2000, not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there
        is a difference in years (1990 vs 2000) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Puratchikkaaran (1990)
        was released before Joker (2000), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    549cfca0-b1fc-40c4-be23-c124c7f8231a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1990 vs 1993) and explicitly states that Puratchikkaaran was released
        earlier than Joker. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on finding
        a difference in release dates, not on them being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1990 vs 1993). The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    699e0ddd-5018-4882-93a8-3d352e167473:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at specific years for both
        movies (Puratchikkaaran in 1990 and Joker in 2000), it does not state they
        were released in the same year. The NO answer is based on Puratchikkaaran
        being released EARLIER than Joker, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Therefore, Joker was released
        later, so the answer is NO, Puratchikkaaran wasn't released later than Joker."
        This is a clear NO answer comparing the release dates, determining that Puratchikkaaran
        (1990) was released before Joker (2000).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d4e501c4-2c17-4beb-aba2-dcc0221a2e46:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a 10-year difference
        between the release dates (1990 vs 2000), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning about release dates (1990
        vs 2000). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final answer in bold stating "**Answer:** YES". The reasoning was
        based on comparing release dates of 2010 vs 1993.

    f41fe243-e15c-4451-9a35-67d27aa6de06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Puratchikkaaran (1990) was released EARLIER than Joker (2000). The model
        explicitly states different values (1990 vs 2000) and bases its NO answer
        on this difference, not on equality. The values are clearly not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        (1990 vs 2000).

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1951),
        the model explicitly states there was a temporal difference between them (September
        vs December) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO wasn't because the dates were the same, but because one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final one-word answer, concluding that The River was
        released earlier than Fanfares of Love. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        The River (1951) was released before Fanfares of Love (1953). It explicitly
        states different values (1951 vs 1953) and bases its NO answer on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its comparative answer, explaining that since The River (1951)
        came before Fanfares of Love (1953), it was not released later.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release dates (January vs September 1951) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the
        end of its response, after determining that The River (Sept 1951) was released
        later than Fanfares of Love (Jan 1951).'

        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear explanation for why The River was released later than Fanfares of
        Love, citing specific release dates (January 1952 vs September 1951).

    570cdce0-b2a7-45b7-9f7d-a9cc2b1fe18a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates
        (September vs December 1951). The NO is because The River was released earlier,
        not later, than Fanfares of Love.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on release dates (September
        vs December 1951). The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative
        result.

        automatically receives a False classification per the instructions. The equal
        values criteria only apply when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1951, it explicitly states there was a difference in release dates (September
        vs November 1951) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not
        because the values were equal. The model concludes NO because The River was
        released earlier, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (September 1951 vs November 1951). The answer is given definitively without

        equal - it explicitly states that The River was released in September 1951
        while Fanfares was released in December 1951, and uses this difference in
        timing as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        for V.I.P.s vs September/October 1963 for In the French Style) and gives this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because one film was
        released later than the other, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss both films being released in 1963, but never reached a final NO
        conclusion based on this or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth
        between different possibilities, considering various release dates and scenarios,
        but ultimately gets cut off mid-thought ("Let me check the exact release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        While the model does discuss both films being released in the same year/month,
        this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO conclusion. The model keeps going back and forth
        between different possibilities based on release dates and countries, discussing
        various scenarios without making a final determination. The response actually
        gets cut off mid-sentence, further indicating no final answer was given.

    72bddecb-82ed-4cf7-bf38-f03a7e38a0a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this wasn't
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates (September vs October 1963) and uses this
        difference to conclude that The V.I.P.s was released earlier. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (September 1963 vs October 1963). The NO answer directly addresses whether
        The V.I.P.s was released later than In the French Style.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equality/inequality of values
        is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "So, based on my reasoning, the answer is YES" followed by a clear "YES" answer
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2005 vs 2013) and determining that one precedes the other, not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states that 2005 precedes 2013,
        making "A Woman" earlier than "Red."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "A Woman" was not released later
        than "Red" based on comparing their release dates (2005 vs 2013).

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        analysis, providing a clear affirmative answer that Colagrande's movie was
        released later than Parisot's movie. The answer was stated multiple times,
        both in the thinking section and in the final structured response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a definitive NO answer, so the question of whether values were
        equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers "YES" as a possibility near the end ("perhaps the correct
        answer is YES"), it continues to express uncertainty and presents multiple
        alternatives without settling on a final answer. The response ends mid-sentence,
        further indicating no definitive conclusion was reached.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of declaring the values equal as part of a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear YES/NO answer. The model spends most of the time trying to verify the
        existence of the films and seems confused about Dean Parisot's "Red." It questions
        the premise but never reaches a definitive conclusion or provides an explicit
        comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after determining
        that "A Woman" (2020) was released later than "Red 2" (2013). Despite some
        uncertainty in the thinking process about which "Red" movie to compare against,
        the model gives a clear final comparative answer of YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years for the
        two films (1975 vs 1976) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is a clear
        one-year difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Konuma's film
        was released earlier than Schlatter's film.

        were released in the same year (1976), stating "Both films share the same
        release year" and "making neither 'later' than the other within that year."
        The equality of release years is the main reason given for the NO answer.

        values (1973 vs 1976) and explicitly states that "1973 is before 1976." The
        NO is based on finding a difference in values, not because the values are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion that Konuma's film

        and the other in 1976, explicitly noting a one-year difference. The NO answer
        was given because 1975 is before 1976, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Konuma's film was NOT
        released after Schlatter's film. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        reasoning points at the end, it explicitly states "both projects were released
        in the same year" as part of its justification for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion, even though it notes confusion
        about one of the films. The model doesn't reject making the comparison but
        rather concludes with a definitive NO based on its analysis of the release

        in the same year" and "same year means neither is later" as the reason for
        its NO answer, without noting any differences between the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1950, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (January vs November)
        and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The model specifically
        notes that Afsar was released earlier (January 6, 1950) than Mark of the Gorilla
        (November 15, 1950). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on release
        dates (January vs November 1950). The answer is reinforced in both the thinking
        section and the formal conclusion.

        answer. In its explanation, it states "both films are considered to share
        the same release year" and "Since neither is definitively later within the
        same year, the answer is NO." The model did not indicate any difference between
        the release dates.

        December as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (April 7,
        1950 vs November 15, 1950) and concludes NO because Afsar was released earlier
        than Mark of the Gorilla.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion

        discussion of both films being from 1950 is irrelevant since no final NO answer
        was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers both possibilities
        and ends with uncertainty, stating "But if someone knows that 'Afsar' was
        released later in the year than 'Mark of the Gorilla,' then yes... But I have
        to go with the information I have" without making a final determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        discusses that both films were from 1950 but never makes this equality the
        basis for a NO answer, as it never actually gives a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly circles around different possibilities,
        acknowledging both films are from 1950 but stating it cannot determine which
        was released later without knowing the exact months. The response ends mid-sentence
        without providing a final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1950) and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. The model states "Both Chetan Anand's *Afsar* and William Berke's
        *Mark of the Gorilla* were released in 1950" and doesn't indicate any difference
        between their release dates, only noting that without specific dates within
        1950, they should be considered the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film was released
        later than the other. The answer is clearly stated and justified, even if
        the reasoning process shows uncertainty.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie was released
        earlier than the other (2012 vs 2018), and this difference in dates is the
        reason for the NO answer. The values being compared (release dates) are different,

        the Deadly Necklace" on October 5, 1962 (or 1964 in the UK). The NO answer
        is given because "We Joined the Navy" was released EARLIER, not because the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. While it mentions both films were released in 1962 in different
        markets, it ultimately bases its NO answer on finding that "We Joined the
        Navy" (1962) came before "Sherlock Holmes" (1964) in the UK market. The model
        explicitly states a difference in timing, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"

        (March vs July 1974) and based its NO answer on Gold being released earlier
        than Nightmare Honeymoon.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides

        the release dates are equal/same - in fact, it specifically identifies a temporal
        difference of several months.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that "Gold" was released before "Nightmare Honeymoon"
        (May 1974 vs August 1974). This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in release dates (May vs August 1974), not because the values are equal. The
        model explicitly states that August comes after May, indicating different
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        release dates (May 1974 vs August 1974) and explicitly states that one came
        earlier than the other. The NO is not due to the dates being equal - in fact,
        the model specifically identifies a temporal difference between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Gold was NOT released

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (May 1974 vs
        August 1974) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO is because
        Gold was released EARLIER (May) than Nightmare Honeymoon (August), not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether Gold was released later than Nightmare Honeymoon. The model provides
        specific dates and a clear reasoning for this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Gold was released
        in May 1974 while Nightmare Honeymoon was released in October 1974 - explicitly
        stating a difference in release dates, not because the dates were the same.
        The model specifically notes that Gold came out "earlier" than Nightmare Honeymoon.

        in the release years (1981 vs 1982) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model states "Maria, Mirabela was released earlier"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (NO because
        Maria, Mirabela was released earlier). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

        it did not give NO because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated
        different dates (November 1981 vs April 1982) and gave NO because the first
        film came earlier than the second. The values being compared were different,
        not the same.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1987 vs 1997) and explicitly states that Pagaivan was released
        before Hideous! with a 10-year difference. The NO is not due to equal values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (September 7, 2001 vs November 18, 2001) and used this difference
        to conclude that The Musketeer was released EARLIER than Gypsy Woman, not
        later. The NO was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (September vs November 2001). The answer is definitive
        and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate if equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly considers different possibilities
        ("if X then YES, if Y then NO") but doesn't commit to a final conclusion.

        values (September 7, 2001 vs November 18, 2001) and explicitly states that
        one came before the other. The NO is not due to the dates being equal, but
        rather because The Musketeer was released earlier than Gypsy Woman.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (September
        vs November 2001). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification rules.
        Even if we were to consider the "NO" possibilities the model discusses, these
        are based on existence/non-existence issues rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought and
        never reaches a clear final answer. While the model considers various possibilities
        and leans towards "NO" at points, it keeps second-guessing and presenting
        alternatives without settling on a definitive conclusion. The response ends

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in the tentative "NO" suggestions throughout the text, the model never
        bases this on the values being equal - rather it struggles with the existence
        of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and highly uncertain throughout. While it tentatively suggests "NO" several
        times, it repeatedly questions its own reasoning and expresses doubt about
        the existence of one of the movies. It never arrives at a clear, definitive
        answer. The response shows the model struggling with the comparison due to

      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it explores various possibilities and mentions "maybe the answer is
        NO" several times, it never makes a definitive statement. The response ends
        mid-sentence and primarily discusses uncertainty about the existence of Richard

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        consideration is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off mid-sentence, but
        in the preceding analysis, while expressing uncertainty about "Brave", it
        concluded "So the answer is YES" based on the assumption that if "Brave" exists,
        it was likely from around 1994, making Bloodfist VI (1995) later. Despite

        as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the release dates
        were the same - in fact, it specifically identifies a difference in timing,
        with one being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that La Carapate was released
        in August 1978 while Hardware Wars was released in November 1978. This is

        Boatniks vs August 1970 for Hello-Goodbye) and uses this difference to justify
        its NO answer. The NO is based on The Boatniks being released before, not
        on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        explicitly states different release dates (January vs March) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and
        the NO is based on one date being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion
        that "The Family Strikes Back" was released earlier, not later than "Dharm

        in 1985 and the other in 1986, with "The Family Strikes Back" being released
        earlier. The NO answer was based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that "The Family Strikes Back"
        was released earlier than "Dharm Adhikari" (1985 vs 1986). The answer is definitive

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        earlier than the other (1984 vs 1986), and this difference in dates was the
        reason for the NO answer. The values being compared (release dates) were different,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss the possibility of the films being from the same year (1986) but
        never reached this as a final conclusion or gave it as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final answer. The model considers multiple possibilities (both
        films in 1986, one in 1985 and one in 1986, etc.) but ends mid-thought without
        making a definitive comparison. The response trails off discussing possibilities
        without providing a conclusive YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1978 vs 1986) and explicitly stating that one precedes the other.
        The model does not claim the values are equal or the same - in fact, it specifically
        notes that 1978 is earlier than 1986.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the formal answer section.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it identified (1978 vs 1986).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in 1968" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer. The model specifically notes that "neither is later than the other"
        because they were released in the same year. While it mentions the possibility
        of different months, it treats the years being the same as the decisive factor
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film was released
        later than the other. The answer is clearly stated and not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model determined both movies were released
        in 1968, it explicitly states different release dates (August 28 vs September
        6) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are
        not equal/same, and the NO is based on one date being earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, confirming that Day of the
        Evil Gun was not released later than Sardinia Kidnapped because August 28,
        1968 is earlier than September 6, 1968.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually gave a final NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether such
        an answer was based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion.
        While it considers various possibilities (both being 1968, one being 1967/1969),
        it repeatedly expresses uncertainty about exact dates and keeps reconsidering
        different scenarios without making a final determination. The response ends
        mid-thought without providing a definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (1992 vs 1993) and explicitly states that 1992 precedes 1993. The NO
        is not due to equal values, but rather because one date comes before the other.

        classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        reaches a definitive conclusion. While it considers various possibilities
        (1993, 1994, 1995, etc.), it ends with "perhaps it's from the mid-90s" without
        making a final YES/NO determination. The response shows uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (1999),
        the model explicitly states different release dates (September 10 vs September
        22) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The values being
        compared are not equal - there is a clear temporal difference of about two
        weeks between the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (Rockford

        explicitly states different months (June vs September) and uses this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model does not base its NO answer on
        the values being equal - in fact, it specifically points out that one came
        before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that "That Lucky Touch" was released in June 1975 while
        "Journey Into Fear" was released in September 1975, with June preceding September.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different dates (March 1 vs March
        9 for theatrical releases, or March 1 vs February 17 for festival premiere)
        and concludes NO because La Zizanie was released earlier, not because they
        were released at the same time.

        a year after the other. The NO is based on "Me and My Brother" being released
        earlier, not on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1968 vs 1969) to support its comparative
        conclusion that "Me and My Brother" was not released later than "The Guru".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1968 vs 1969) and explicitly states that one came earlier than the
        other. The NO is not due to the values being equal, but rather because one
        film came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Me and My
        Brother" was not released later than "The Guru", supporting this with specific
        years (1968 vs 1969).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in years (1968 vs 1969) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The model clearly indicates Me and My Brother came before The Guru.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing the release
        dates (1968 vs 1969) and concluding that Me and My Brother was not released
        later than The Guru.

    475fa254-4996-4fea-a9f4-23cb5423d2c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly states that one film was released in
        1968 and the other in 1969, and bases its NO answer on the fact that 1968
        is earlier than 1969. The values being compared (release years) are different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative conclusion
        that "Me and My Brother was not released later than The Guru" based on specific
        years (1968 vs 1969).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1968 vs 1969) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model clearly indicates "Me and My Brother" was released
        earlier than "The Guru."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1968 vs 1969). The answer is given both in the
        conclusion of its thinking and in the formal step-by-step explanation.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because 1968 precedes
        1969, not because the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states different
        years (1968 vs 1969) and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation
        that Me and My Brother (1968) precedes The Guru (1969).

    d518da39-3b11-43d1-b595-26ed2f2ba0a0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (1968 vs 1969), not on equality. The model explicitly states that
        one film came out earlier than the other, with "Me and My Brother" in 1968
        and "The Guru" in 1969. The difference in years is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1968
        vs 1969). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1968 vs 1969) and used this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. The films were released in different years, not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, explaining that "Me and My Brother" was released earlier than
        "The Guru" (1968 vs 1969). This is a direct comparative answer to the question
        of whether the first film was released later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one film
        was released in 1968 and the other in 1969, with the NO answer being because
        Frank's film came BEFORE (not equal to) Ivory's film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct comparison showing Frank's film (1968)
        came before Ivory's film (1969). The answer is definitive and comparative.

    7abb1203-d626-497b-b09c-51bc84857db0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 1988 is earlier
        than 1989, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference in years (1988 vs 1989) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with a direct comparison showing that 1988 is earlier than
        1989.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was discussed.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to this answer, comparing 1990 (Thampi's
        film) to 1989 (Smight's film).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. We don't need to evaluate whether
        values were equal since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the conclusion of its step-by-step explanation.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 1980 and the other in 1989, with the first being earlier than the second.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive comparative conclusion based on the release
        dates it identified (1980 vs 1989)

    cee213a9-f5c5-4f04-bcc7-15d810a213f4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1988 and the other in 1989, and the NO was because 1988 is earlier than
        1989. The model identified a clear difference in values (1988 vs 1989) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        release dates it identified (1988 vs 1989). The answer is given both in the
        conclusion and in the step-by-step explanation.

        not relevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step reasoning comparing the release dates (1989
        vs 1990) and concluding "yes, it was released later."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release dates (June vs December 1966), but this is irrelevant since the question
        only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        and provided a clear comparative conclusion that Harald Philipp's film was

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Blue
        Crush was released in August 2002 while Chaos and Desire was released in October
        2002. The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates (August vs
        October) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not because
        the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that Blue Crush was
        released earlier, not later than Chaos and Desire. This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blue Crush
        (August 16, 2002) was released BEFORE Chaos and Desire (September/November
        2002). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing release dates.
        The answer is definitive and comparative, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states different release dates (2002 vs 2003) as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is based on one movie being released before the
        other, not on them being released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it
        identified (Blue Crush in 2002 vs Chaos and Desire in 2003)

    5782ead5-710d-4ce5-be8d-7c5a6b8fc48d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it explicitly states there is a temporal difference
        between the releases, with Blue Crush (August 2002) being released before
        Chaos and Desire's general release (May 2003). The NO is based on this difference
        in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that Blue Crush was not released
        later than Chaos and Desire. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

    58eeb0ee-3eb9-495d-b30a-3f9759c7fbaf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates (August 2002 vs. November 2002) and used this difference
        to conclude that Blue Crush came out earlier, making it NO. The values being
        compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive explanation that Blue Crush was released earlier
        (August 2002) than Chaos and Desire (November 2002). This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blue Crush was released earlier
        (August 2002) than Chaos and Desire (March 2003). The model identified a clear
        difference in release dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Blue Crush was released
        before Chaos and Desire (not after, which was what was being asked).

        on August 16, 2002, while Chaos and Desire was released on September 6, 2002
        - different dates with Blue Crush being earlier. The NO answer was based on
        this chronological difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive step-by-step explanation concluding that Blue
        Crush was not released later than Chaos and Desire. The answer is a direct
        comparative result based on specific dates the model recalled.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference in release
        dates (August vs September 2002) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer. The model clearly indicates Blue Crush was "earlier" than Chaos
        and Desire.

      explanation_equal_values: 'While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release dates: May 17, 1967 for "Two Weeks in September" versus June 15,
        1967 for "Branded to Kill". The NO answer was given because one date was earlier
        than the other, not because they were the same.'

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1967, the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in release months (May vs June) and
        uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. Since the values being
        compared are not equal (they differ by one month), this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and provides
        a definitive comparative conclusion that "Two Weeks in September" was released
        earlier than "Branded to Kill", with specific months given (May 1967 vs June

        because the values (release dates) are equal. The model explicitly states
        that one movie was released in 1987 and the other in 1990, with a three-year
        difference. The NO is because 1987 is earlier than 1990, not because the dates

        in release dates (1987 vs 1990, with a three-year gap) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The movies were released in different years,
        not the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the thinking process and in the formal answer section.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        years (1969 vs 1970), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that one film was released in 1969 and the other in 1970, and concludes
        NO because "1969 is earlier than 1970". While the model discussed same-year
        scenarios earlier in its thinking, its final conclusion was based on different
        years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that confirms this as its comparative conclusion
        (1969 is earlier than 1970). The answer is definitive and not qualified with

        reason for answering NO, saying "Without specific month/day details, 'later
        than' cannot be confirmed."

        in 1969, it explicitly states that one was released "earlier in 1969" and
        the other "later that year." This temporal difference, even within the same
        year, means they are not exactly equal. The NO answer is based on comparing
        years only, not on the values being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end,
        with a clear explanation that both films were released in 1969. While there

        both films were released in 1969 (same year) as one reason for its NO answer,
        it also considers an alternative scenario where The Intruders is from 1970
        as another reason for NO. The model doesn't definitively settle on equality
        as the sole reason for its NO answer, and presents multiple possible scenarios.
        Additionally, even when discussing the 1969 scenario, it mentions the possibility
        of different months within that year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model appears to be uncertain and goes back and
        forth between different possibilities, but in its final reasoning it settles
        on "NO" for two possible scenarios: either both films are from 1969 (so neither
        is later), or The Intruders is from 1970 (in which case it still concludes
        "NO"). While the reasoning is somewhat confused, the model consistently states

        than 2005), not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the release dates it identified
        (2004 vs 2005). The answer is explicitly stated and used as a comparative
        result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48eed4f1-5420-46f3-8574-24652e67affc:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2004 vs 2005) and explicitly states that "2004 is earlier than 2005."
        The NO is not due to the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning that Sepet (2004) was released before A
        Love to Hide (2005), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (2004 vs 2005) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit reasoning that Sepet (2004) was released before A Love to Hide
        (2005), not later. The answer directly addresses the comparative question
        with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (2004 vs 2005), not on equality. The model explicitly states that
        one film was released before the other, with "Sepet" in 2004 and "A Love to
        Hide" in 2005. The difference in years is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2004
        vs 2005). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (2004 vs 2005) and explicitly stating that one precedes the other,
        not because the values are equal. The model specifically identifies April
        2004 for Sepet and January 2005 for A Love to Hide as different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates and concluding that since Sepet (2004)
        precedes A Love to Hide (2005), it was not released later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (2004 vs 2005) and this difference was the reason for the
        NO answer. The values being compared were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison of release dates (2004 vs 2005). The
        answer is definitive and comparative.

        The model never reached a final NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equality was the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends mid-thought without providing
        a clear YES/NO conclusion. Throughout the response, it repeatedly considers
        different possibilities and scenarios, going back and forth between potential
        answers, but never arrives at a definitive answer. The response appears to
        be cut off while still deliberating.

        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one value (1979)
        was earlier than the other value (1980), and this difference was the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Pirates (1979) was
        released before The Little Dragons (1980), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing release dates
        (1979 vs 1980) and concluding that Pirates was released earlier, not later
        than The Little Dragons.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Pirates (1979) was released EARLIER than Little Dragons (1980). The values
        are different (1979 vs 1980), not equal, and this difference is the basis
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1979
        vs 1980). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

    acb4a5ed-4a90-4a31-9296-0430f5be85d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (1979 vs 1980) and explicitly states that one came before the other.
        It does not claim the values are equal or the same as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear reasoning that Pirates (1979) was released before Little Dragons
        (1980), not after. This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.

    d6695c52-0d1f-4596-bc4f-80fdcfbf63dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1979 vs 1980), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that Pirates (1979) came out before Little Dragons (1980), and this
        difference in years is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (1979
        vs 1980). The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1979 and the other in 1980, and the NO was given because 1979 is before/earlier
        than 1980. The model identified a clear difference in values (1979 vs 1980)
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the release dates it identified (1979 vs 1980). The answer is definitive and
        matches the format of providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated a difference in timing (January vs May
        2004) and gave NO because Phil the Alien was released earlier, not because
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Phil the Alien was released earlier (January 2004) than Or (May 2004).
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        even in its discussion of dates, the model was identifying specific differences
        (September 2 vs September 10) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends abruptly mid-sentence without
        providing a clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various scenarios
        and seems to be leaning towards YES (based on September 10 vs September 2
        release dates), it never explicitly states a final conclusion before cutting
        off.

        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that "Phil
        the Alien" was released later than "Or (My Treasure)" because it premiered
        in September 2004 while "Or" debuted in May 2004.

        2004 and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. While
        it mentions different months (May vs September), it explicitly bases its NO
        answer on them being released in "the same year" and states "both films are
        2004. So 'Phil the Alien' wasn't released later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear comparative reasoning about the release dates. The answer is definitive
        and directly addresses the comparison question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing clear reasoning. While it questions
        the existence of one of the films, it still provides a definitive NO answer
        rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        equal. The model explicitly states there is a two-day difference between the
        releases, with Pandora's being earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response was cut off, but throughout the
        lengthy deliberation, it repeatedly concludes that "Pandora's Promise" was
        released on June 12, 2013, and "Summer in February" on June 14, 2013, and
        therefore states "NO" multiple times because Pandora's was released earlier,

        between the release dates, with Pandora's Promise being released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being
        equal. The model never states the releases occurred on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes multiple times that the
        answer is NO, stating that Pandora's Promise was released earlier than Summer
        in February (both when comparing premiere dates and general release dates).
        The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer is NO" and provides specific

        was a 2-day difference between the releases, with Pandora's Promise releasing
        on June 12 and Summer in February on June 14. The NO answer was given because
        Pandora's Promise came first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the dates are close (only 2
        days apart), it explicitly states that one date is earlier than the other
        (June 12 vs June 14). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model discussed specific dates that were close together, it never reached
        a final NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO conclusion
        to the comparison. While it worked through various scenarios and dates (June
        12 vs June 14), it ended mid-thought without stating a final answer. The response
        cuts off while still analyzing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a two-day
        difference between the release dates (June 12 vs June 14), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer. The model specifically notes that "Summer
        in February" came out two days after "Pandora's Promise".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a detailed explanation comparing the release dates. The
        model is confident in this comparative conclusion based on specific dates

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal
        - it explicitly states there is a two-day difference between the release dates
        (June 12 vs June 14) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even though this is a small difference, any stated difference means we must
        classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Pandora's Promise was released earlier (June 12)
        than Summer in February (June 14). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 2010 and the other in 2011, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO
        was given because the first film was released earlier, not because the dates
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparison showing that Samiran Barua Ahi Ase (2010)
        was released before God Is the Bigger Elvis (2011), not later. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (2010 vs 2011) and explicitly states that one was earlier than the
        other. It did not give the answer NO because the values were equal - in fact,
        it specifically identified a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning based on release dates (2010

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was released
        in 2010 and the other in 2011, and concluded NO because 2010 is earlier than
        2011. The model identified a clear difference in values (2010 vs 2011) as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same year (2003),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release months (March
        vs May) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared are not equal, so this is not a case of equality leading to
        the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is
        a difference in release dates (December 2001 vs January 2002) and concludes
        NO because the first film came EARLIER than the second. The inequality between
        dates is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the step-by-step explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, it was not released later)
        based on comparing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one movie was released
        in 1995 and the other in 1998, and the NO was given because 1995 is before
        (not equal to) 1998. The model identified a clear difference in values as

        in 1958 and the other in 1959, with the NO answer being based on 1958 being
        earlier than 1959.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific years (1958 vs 1959) and explaining that
        since 1958 is earlier than 1959, Annakin's film was not released later.

    be4f04b5-751f-4ef7-81cf-9da455bdaad7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found that
        the films were released in different years (1958 vs 1959), not because they
        were equal. It explicitly states there is a one-year difference between the
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative explanation that Annakin's
        film (1958) was released before Rakoff's film (1959).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        different values (1994 vs 1995) and explicitly states that "1994 is before
        1995." The NO is based on finding a difference in values, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        this as a direct comparative result based on the years 1994 vs 1995, not due

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.

        reaches a definitive conclusion. The model repeatedly wavers between YES and
        NO depending on different possible release date scenarios, but ultimately
        trails off mid-thought without making a final determination. The response
        ends with "But I''m not entirely sure about the exact dates. Another approach:

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states they were released at different times (May vs August) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model concludes
        NO because Persian Cats was released earlier, not because the values were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, concluding that "No One Knows About Persian
        Cats" was released in May 2009, which was earlier than "Madly Bangalee" in
        August 2009.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of the model's discussion about both films being released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends with "YES" mid-sentence, but this
        appears to be cut off. Throughout the analysis, the model repeatedly expresses
        uncertainty about exact release dates while confirming both films were released
        in 2009. The model never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion, instead continuing
        to debate possibilities. Without a clear final comparative answer, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 2009, the model
        explicitly states different months (May vs June) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the release dates
        were the same - rather, it specifically cites that Persian Cats was released
        earlier as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Persian Cats was released earlier than Madly
        Bangalee, with specific dates (May 2009 vs June 2009). This is a clear NO
        answer to whether Persian Cats was released later.

        discusses the possibility of the films being released in the same year (2009)
        but never reaches a firm conclusion about equality being the reason for a
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cut off mid-word)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. The model spends a lot of time
        considering different possibilities (both films in 2009, maybe one earlier/later)

        NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1984, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (February vs November) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are not equal - one is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative explanation, stating that Shanghai 13 was
        released in February 1984, which is earlier than Alphabet City's November
        1984 release.

        answer is NO." The model considers the possibility of different months within
        1984 but ultimately bases its NO answer on them being from the same year.'
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought, but
        throughout the lengthy deliberation, the model repeatedly concludes that both
        films were released in 1984 and states "Therefore, the answer is NO" multiple
        times. While it occasionally considers the possibility of different months
        within 1984, it consistently returns to NO as the answer based on the same

        The values are not equal/same, and the NO is based on Shanghai 13 being released
        one week earlier.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning that Shanghai 13 was released

        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through its reasoning but never arrives
        at a clear YES/NO answer about which film was released later. The response
        ends abruptly mid-sentence without providing a conclusion. The model discusses
        possible release dates (both around 1984-1985) but remains uncertain about
        the exact timing.

        explicitly states different release dates (February vs May) and uses this
        difference as the basis for its NO answer. The model does not claim the release
        dates were the same - in fact, it specifically identifies that one came before
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates to support its comparative conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states different release dates (March vs September
        1984) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. While they
        are in the same year, the model specifically points out the temporal difference
        between the releases.

        films being released in the same year (1984). The model explicitly states
        "they were released in the same year, so the answer is NO" and reiterates
        this as the primary reason in its final reasoning. This equality of release
        years is the main basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values (release dates) are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states
        there is a difference in release dates - April 1984 vs September 1984. The
        NO answer is given because Shanghai 13 was released earlier, not later, than
        Alphabet City.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (NO because
        Shanghai 13 was released earlier, not later than Alphabet City). The answer
        is definitive and based on specific dates the model claims to know.

        in 1984, it explicitly states different release dates (August vs September)
        and uses this difference to conclude NO. The NO answer is based on Shanghai
        13 being released BEFORE Alphabet City, not because they were released at
        the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after determining that Shanghai 13''s August 1984 release came before Alphabet

        we were to consider the NO-leaning statements in the text, they were based
        on release order (February vs May) rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-thought and never provides a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While it discusses various possibilities and seems
        to lean towards NO at points, it continues to second-guess and question its
        own reasoning throughout. The response shows uncertainty and keeps considering
        alternative scenarios without reaching a definitive conclusion.

        NO answer, with "Jaali Note" being earlier than "High Note".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer

        share the same release year, Jaali Note was not released later than High Note"
        as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        values are equal. Instead, it states that High Note was released in December
        1960 while Jaali Note was released "earlier in the same year." Even though
        they're in the same year, the model explicitly indicates a temporal difference
        between them, making them unequal.

        The model never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether
        equal values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        arrives at a clear YES/NO answer. It repeatedly expresses uncertainty about
        exact release dates, considers multiple possibilities, and ends mid-thought

        explicitly states they were released at different times within that year (Jaali
        Note earlier, possibly March, and High Note in November). The NO answer is
        based on this temporal difference, not on the values being equal. The model
        specifically argues that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        clear reasoning for this answer, comparing the release dates of the two films.
        While there is some uncertainty in the exact dates, the model commits to a
        definitive NO answer based on its reasoning that Jaali Note was likely released
        earlier in 1960.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1992, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (May 8 vs
        May 16) and uses this difference as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The values being compared are not equal/same, so this is not a case of equal
        values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific dates showing Khuda Gawah was released
        before Minbo. The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or
        inability to determine.

        vs May 16) and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer, not equality.
        The model concluded Khuda Gawah was "earlier than Minbo," indicating a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided

        - it explicitly states that Khuda Gawah was released on May 8 while Minbo
        was released on May 16, with Khuda Gawah being "a week earlier". This difference
        in dates, even though in the same month/year, means they are not equal.

        as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal, and the NO is based
        on Khuda Gawah being released earlier than Minbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly states different dates (May 8 vs May 16) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        and the NO is based on one date being earlier than the other, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Khuda Gawah was not released later than Minbo. The

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in the same month
        and year (May 1992), the model explicitly states different dates (May 8 vs
        May 16) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. The model
        specifically says "Since May 8 precedes May 16, Khuda Gawah was released earlier."
        This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative explanation that Khuda Gawah was released earlier than Minbo,
        with specific dates (May 8 vs May 16, 1992). This is a clear negative response
        to whether Khuda Gawah was released later than Minbo.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did arrive at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there was a difference in release dates (May 8, 1992 vs May 16, 1992)
        and concludes NO because Khuda Gawah came out earlier than Minbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation that Khuda Gawah was released
        earlier than Minbo. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about one film potentially not existing
        rather than the films having equal release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides reasoning
        based on not being able to find evidence of "Union Leader" existing or being
        released after 2017. Since the model is rejecting the premise by suggesting
        one of the films doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather

        release dates, but rather on the apparent non-existence of one of the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this in its reasoning steps, concluding that Union Leader was
        not released later than Last Night. However, this NO is primarily based on
        questioning the existence of one of the films rather than making a direct
        temporal comparison, which means this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        doesn't exist or was released before 2023, while the other was released in
        2023. This is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it provides this as a
        comparative conclusion based on the release dates it could determine, not
        as an inability to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot verify one of the films exists or find
        its release date. The model rejects the premise by suggesting the film may
        not exist or may have incorrect information. This makes it a case where the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the films
        having equal/identical release dates. Instead, it concludes NO because it
        cannot confirm that Union Leader was released after May 2023 (when Last Night
        was released). The reasoning suggests either an earlier release or uncertainty
        about the release date, not equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a clear comparative reasoning for why one
        film was not released later than the other. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about one film, it still commits to a definitive NO answer.

        ("maybe the answer is YES" / "maybe the answer is NO"), expresses uncertainty
        throughout, and ends mid-thought without providing a final answer. The response

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        question only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear final statement confirming that Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was
        released after The Wild Chase, comparing specific dates (Feb 23 vs Feb 13).

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, with a clear explanation comparing the release dates (January
        vs February 1965) and concluding that Dr. Terror's was released later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states that one was released
        in February and the other in April, and uses this difference in dates as the
        reason for its NO answer. The dates are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific dates and explaining that since Dr. Terror's
        release in February came before The Wild Chase's release in April, the answer
        is NO. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release dates (February vs January 1965) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including as its final answer, and provides a clear step-by-step explanation
        concluding that Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was released later than The
        Wild Chase.

        results in False according to the classification criteria. The equal values
        criteria only needs to be evaluated for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, stating that Dr.
        Terror's House of Horrors was released on February 23, 1965, which was three
        days after The Wild Chase's release on February 20, 1965.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal values analysis
        is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        was a difference in release dates (February vs March 1965) and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model clearly indicates Dr. Terror's
        was released earlier than The Wild Chase.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative explanation, stating that Dr. Terror's was
        released earlier (February 1965) than The Wild Chase (March 1965). This is
        a definitive comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values were equal is not relevant since the model did not give a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model ultimately
        gave a clear "YES" answer in its final conclusion, stating "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." While the model showed uncertainty throughout its reasoning,
        it ended with a definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it gives NO because it cannot verify the existence/release
        date of Omkaram and defaults to NO due to this uncertainty. It does not state
        the release dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about one of the films, it provides this
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a final structured explanation ending with "Answer: YES". Despite showing
        uncertainty in its reasoning process, it ultimately committed to a clear YES
        answer.'

    57c33a93-cc45-49ba-aa69-e745f71c74be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never definitively stated the values were equal as the primary reason for
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive reasoning but never reaches
        a definitive YES/NO conclusion. The model repeatedly says things like "perhaps"
        and "I might lean towards YES. But I'm really not sure." The response ends
        mid-thought without providing a final answer. This indicates uncertainty and
        inability to make a determination.

    6dbce0f3-cd2d-4975-96c2-04df3555621d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the existence
        of "Omkaram", it does not base its NO answer on the values being equal. Instead,
        it bases the NO answer on finding that the closest matching film (Om) was
        released in 1995, which is earlier than 1997. The model explicitly notes this
        difference in dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a clear comparative conclusion after its analysis. While the
        model expresses uncertainty about one of the films, it ultimately commits
        to a NO answer based on its reasoning that even the closest match (Om from
        1995) would be earlier than 1997.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
        The question of whether values were equal is not relevant since there was
        no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends mid-sentence without providing a
        clear final YES/NO answer. While the model discusses various possibilities
        and leans towards YES multiple times, it never definitively states a final
        conclusion. The response shows extensive uncertainty and consideration of
        multiple scenarios without reaching a firm determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never definitively concluded the values were equal - it actually spent most
        of the response trying to determine if one of the movies existed and what
        its release date might be.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model never reaches a definitive YES/NO conclusion.
        It repeatedly oscillates between different possibilities: "if Omkaram is a
        typo for Om (1995) then NO, if it''s a different film released later then
        YES." The response ends mid-sentence without making a final determination.
        The model expresses uncertainty about the existence and release date of "Omkaram"

    e5d3462e-68ae-4132-a3e8-2ee42a29b571:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response is incomplete and ends mid-sentence.
        While the model seems to be leaning towards suggesting Omkaram would be a
        later film, it never actually provides a clear YES/NO answer. The response
        shows significant uncertainty throughout and ends without making a definitive
        comparative statement.

    fd3bff6c-b9fb-4e58-a528-790ccbab66b1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO because it couldn't
        verify the existence of "Omkaram" and reasoned that even if there was a mix-up
        with "Om" (1995), that would be earlier than "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (1997).
        The model's reasoning was based on chronological differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, providing reasoning based on its analysis
        of release dates and filmography. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        one of the films, it ultimately commits to a NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or declaring inability to determine.
