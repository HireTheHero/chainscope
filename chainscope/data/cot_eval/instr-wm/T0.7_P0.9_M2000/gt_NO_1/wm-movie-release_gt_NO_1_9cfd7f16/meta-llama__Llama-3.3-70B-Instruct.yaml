      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the tentative "NO" as the final answer, it wasn't based
        on equal values - the model was suggesting one might have come before the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is unclear and hedges significantly.
        While it says "NO" at points, it immediately qualifies this as tentative and
        based on assumptions, stating that "without the exact date of 'Speed,' one
        might not be entirely sure" and that "for a definitive answer, the exact release
        date of Vikram Bhatt's 'Speed' is required." This indicates the model cannot
        make a definitive determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    1d84ad64-2a9f-4d9f-b1a9-74dab38f3dbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both were released in 2007,
        the NO answer is not given because the values are equal. Rather, the NO is
        given because there isn't enough information to confirm one was released later
        than the other. The model explicitly states "without specific month and day
        of release, it's not possible to definitively answer" - making lack of information,
        not equality, the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (indicating it cannot confirm
        "Speed" was released later). While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        dates, it still provides a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Speed was released
        earlier (May) than Looney Tunes (October), showing a clear difference in release
        dates
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Speed was released later than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume
        5, providing specific dates to support this conclusion (Speed in May 2007,
        Looney Tunes in October 2007)'

        year (2007) and explicitly uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer, saying "if something is released in the same year and no earlier
        or later specification is given, we might lean towards a 'no' since it implies
        the same year without clear indication of one being later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.'

        False according to the classification criteria. The equality of years (both
        2007) was noted but did not result in a NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The model's discussion of both
        works being released in 2007 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        YES" at the end of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it notes that both were released in 2007 but explicitly
        states the NO is because "Speed" could have been released before October 30,
        2007. The model acknowledges different possible release dates within 2007,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both were released in the same
        year (2007) and uses this equality as the primary basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 2007, the core reasoning
        for the NO answer is that they were released in the same year. This matches
        the criteria for a True classification where equality is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it discusses some uncertainty about exact dates within
        2007. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating it cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        it does not explicitly state they were released at exactly the same time,
        nor does it cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it expresses
        uncertainty about the exact dates within 2007 and seems to give NO due to
        inability to determine which came later.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While it discusses some complexity and uncertainty

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in the same year (1996), it does not explicitly state that this equality is
        the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it discusses the lack of specific month/day
        information and seems uncertain about the basis for comparison. The same-year
        observation is part of its reasoning process but is not explicitly given as
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly provides a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        in its reasoning, it does ultimately commit to a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in 2005, it does not give the equality of years as the reason for its NO answer.
        Instead, it acknowledges that one could have been released later than the
        other within the same year, and states that without specific dates it cannot
        determine the order. The NO appears to be given due to this inability to determine
        rather than because of equal release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the exact release dates. Since it provides
        a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than refusing to answer or
        stating it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1971) and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer.
        While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within the year, the fundamental
        reason for the NO answer is that they were released in the same year, making
        them equal in terms of release timing at the year level.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"
        in a boxed format at the end of its response. While it expresses uncertainty
        about the exact timing within 1971, it does provide this definitive NO answer
        as required by the format.

        and uses this same-year release as the primary basis for its NO answer. While
        it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within the year, it treats them
        as effectively being released at the same time, making this the reason for

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it cannot confirm which was released later within 1971 without more detailed

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final word "NO" as the answer, the model notes they
        were released in the same year but explicitly states it lacks information
        about exact dates to determine order, rather than claiming equality as the
        reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        it cannot actually determine the order since both were released in 1988 and
        exact dates are unknown. The model explicitly states "it's not possible to
        definitively answer the question" and only provides NO as a forced choice
        while acknowledging the ambiguity. This indicates inability to make the comparison,
        which maps to UNKNOWN.

        However, the model explicitly notes that without specific month/day release
        dates, it cannot definitively determine the order. The NO answer seems to
        be based on this inability to verify rather than an explicit statement that

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1981 is earlier
        than 1982, showing a clear difference in values. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether "Maria,
        Mirabela" was released later than "If You Could See What I Hear". The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        than 1982, showing a clear difference between the release years. The NO is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Maria, Mirabela" was released later than "If You Could See What
        I Hear". The answer is clear and direct, based on comparing release years
        (1981 vs 1982).

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1965
        and uses this equality as part of its reasoning. However, the NO answer is
        primarily given because it "cannot confirm" one was released later than the
        other due to lacking specific dates within 1965, not because they were definitively
        released at the same time. The equality of years is incidental to the inability
        to verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        Instead, it indicates uncertainty about specific release dates within 1965
        and states there's "no clear indication" of The Nanny being released later
        - suggesting the NO is due to lack of evidence rather than confirmed equality.

        its NO answer. In fact, the model emphasizes that without specific release
        dates, it cannot definitively determine the relative timing. The NO appears

        in the same year (2000), the NO answer is not primarily based on equality.
        Instead, the NO is given because the model cannot confirm a later release
        date due to lacking specific date information. The model explicitly states
        it "cannot conclusively determine" the order and chooses NO because it "cannot
        confirm it was released later." This is different from saying NO because they
        were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. Since it provides a

        1986, it does not give the NO answer because the release dates are exactly
        equal. Rather, it gives NO because it cannot confirm that one was released
        later than the other due to lack of specific date information. The equality
        of the year is not presented as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the exact release dates.
        Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than just
        expressing inability to verify), this should be classified as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.

        and discusses this equality, but it does not explicitly state this equality
        is the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it frames the NO answer in terms
        of being unable to determine if one was released after the other within the

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        release dates. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot definitively determine"

        answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within the year,
        the fundamental reason for the NO answer is that they were released in the
        same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        in 1993, it does not use this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it expresses uncertainty about specific release dates within 1993 and seems
        to base its NO on this inability to determine the order, rather than on the
        years being equal. The model explicitly states it needs "specific release
        dates" to make the determination, suggesting the equality of years is not
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about specific release dates within
        1993. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer specifically because
        both films were released in the same year (1952), and this equality is the
        primary reason given for the negative comparison. The model explicitly states
        "both films were released in 1952" and uses this same-year release as the
        basis for its NO answer.

        concluding neither was "later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide this
        definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        does not give the NO answer because they were released at the same time. Instead,
        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm" one was released later than the other
        due to lack of specific release date information. The equality of years is
        mentioned but is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        are equal/same. Instead, it arrives at NO based on comparing different dates
        (Australian release of Opal Dream vs US release of Saints), noting actual

        was "not released significantly later" rather than them being released at
        exactly the same time.

        primarily based on the general release timing being close together, not on
        them being exactly equal. Since any difference is noted, even if the model
        considers it insignificant for the final answer, this should be classified
        as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end

        August while "A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints" was released in September,
        indicating a difference in release dates. The NO was given because "Opal Dream"
        was released BEFORE, not because they were released at the same time.

        in 1961, it did not give a NO answer because the values were equal. Instead,
        it found specific release dates (August 23 vs December 6) and gave NO because
        it found "Ada" was released later, indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. This NO appears to be a direct comparative answer to whether
        "The Young Doctors" was released later than "Ada", as the model concluded
        that "Ada" was released later.

        classifies as False. While the model did note both films were released in
        the same year (2002), this is irrelevant to the classification since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Blue Crush was released on August
        16 while Chaos and Desire was released on August 28, and gave NO because Blue
        Crush was released before (not at the same time as) Chaos and Desire.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        after determining that Blue Crush was released before Chaos and Desire (August

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both movies were
        released in the same year (2002), and this equality is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. The model notes they are "essentially tied" and "share
        the same release year" as the basis for concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would have
        to be NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative answer.

    8446fcc1-92bd-48eb-9163-f5d2ff8295d3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        August 2002, it does not state they were released on exactly the same date.
        In fact, it discusses different types of releases (festival vs. wide release)
        and suggests "Blue Crush" might have had a "wider or more publicized release
        around the same time." The NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion
        that "Blue Crush" was not "significantly later" rather than on the films having
        identical release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the release dates. While it expresses some uncertainty in
        the analysis, it does provide a clear comparative conclusion, so this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released
        in the same year but explicitly states it cannot determine the actual order
        without more detailed release date information, rather than declaring them
        exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer
        is: NO". However, in the explanation, it states it cannot definitively determine
        which was released later without exact dates, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to determine. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 2002
        ("the same year"), but this is not given as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, the NO is based on inability to confirm Blue Crush was released
        later ("we cannot confirm Blue Crush was released later without more specific
        information"). The model doesn't claim the release dates are exactly equal,
        just that they're both in 2002 with unknown specific dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

        noted both films were from 2002, it did not use equality as a reason for a
        NO answer.

        (August 16 vs August 28, 2002) and concludes that Blue Crush was released
        before Chaos and Desire. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Blue Crush was released later than Chaos and Desire, providing
        specific release dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1967) and uses this equality as the primary basis for its NO
        answer. While it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 1967, the
        fundamental reason for the NO answer is that "both films were released in
        the same year, suggesting neither was definitively 'later' than the other
        in a broad sense."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the release years, making this a clear NO answer. While it discusses
        some uncertainty about exact dates, it ultimately commits to a NO response
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning
        about the release years. While it expresses some uncertainty about exact dates

        release dates within 1952, rather than definitively stating equality as the
        reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, as they were released
        in the same year" but also states it cannot definitively determine the order
        within that year. Since the model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        without more detailed release date information, this should be classified

        that without more specific date information within 1952, it cannot confirm
        one was later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with a boxed "NO" as

        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm that 'Mara Maru' was released later"
        due to lack of specific release date information. The equality of the year
        is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.

        is given for reasons other than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.

        the NO answer. While the model discusses uncertainty about specific release
        dates within 1980, it ultimately bases its NO answer on the fact that "both

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions both movies could have been
        released in the same year (1979), this is not presented as the primary reason
        for the NO answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based on the fact that Pirates
        wasn't "necessarily released later" due to uncertainty about exact release
        dates and potential overlap. The model actually suggests one movie might have
        been released in 1980, indicating possible difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it discusses uncertainty and nuance in the comparison.
        Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating

        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it notes this is based on incomplete information. Since it provides

        in the same year is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason
        for NO answers.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1974, it identifies specific different release dates (March 12 vs March
        21) and bases its NO answer on "The Super Cops" being released before "Penda's
        Fen". The NO is not due to equal values, but due to an identified difference
        in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "The Super Cops" was released before
        "Penda's Fen" based on specific dates (March 12 vs March 21, 1974).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both works were released in
        1974, it doesn't use equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it arrives at NO based on the inability to confirm that The Super Cops was
        released later, which is different from saying they were released at the same
        time. The model explicitly discusses the possibility that they could have
        been released at different times within 1974.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it spends considerable time discussing the uncertainty around
        exact release dates. Since it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot determine which was released later due to lacking
        specific release dates. Since the model states it "cannot definitively say

        explicitly notes this difference in years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about one of the films. Since it
        provides this definitive NO answer based on its comparative analysis (rather

        NO answer, noting that without more specific date information, it cannot determine
        a difference in timing. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release times, only that they are in the same year.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different release dates (February
        18 vs February 28, 1965) and concludes that Dr Terror's House of Horrors was
        released before The Wild Chase. While they were released in the same year,
        the specific dates differ.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Dr Terror's House of Horrors was released later than
        The Wild Chase, after determining specific release dates and making a direct
        comparison.

        being released "in the same year" (1965). The model explicitly states they
        are "released in the same time frame" and uses this equality as the main reason
        for saying NO, without noting any differences between their release timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on the information available.

        The model doesn't indicate any difference in release timing, only that more
        specific information isn't available to determine any difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (addressing whether one film
        was released later than the other). While the model notes some uncertainty
        about specific dates, it provides a clear NO answer based on the year-level

        it indicates uncertainty about specific release dates within 1997 and suggests
        the answer could go either way depending on those dates. The NO is not explicitly
        based on the values being equal.

        explicitly states it lacks information to determine the specific order, rather
        than using equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of specific
        release dates within 1997. Since the model states it "cannot conclusively
        determine" the order, this is effectively saying it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        it gives NO because it "cannot confirm a later release based on the year alone."
        The model explicitly acknowledges they could have different release dates
        within the same year. Therefore, the NO is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer (rather than explicitly
        stating it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.
