      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the movies
        were released in different months (April vs May), not the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that May (A Distant Trumpet) is later than April (Gate of Flesh)

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While
        it mentions that more specific dates within 1964 would be needed for complete
        certainty, the NO answer is primarily based on the films being released in
        the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        it found, not as a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality of release years (1964) is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. While it mentions that further research might be
        needed for exact dates within the year, the NO conclusion is based on the
        equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that A Distant Trumpet was not released later
        than Gate of Flesh.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model explicitly notes it cannot determine if one was released earlier
        in the year than the other, treating them as equal in time based on the available
        year-level data. This equality is the basis for concluding that one cannot
        be "later" than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        being in the same year. While the model notes uncertainty about specific months/days,
        it provides NO as its definitive answer to whether one was released later
        than the other.

        NO answer appears to be based on this equality of release years, with no difference
        noted between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a rejection of premises
        or inability to verify)

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1987, the model
        specifically noted different release dates (Awam on Sept 11, Dark Eyes later
        in September/October) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The
        NO wasn't due to equal values, but because Dark Eyes was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Dark Eyes was released after Awam (not earlier), making this a clear
        negative comparative answer.

        NO answer. While it mentions that further research would be needed for within-year
        timing, the NO answer is based on the films having the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result rather than indicating
        inability to determine or rejecting premises.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1987, it found a difference in their specific release months (May vs June)
        and gave NO because Dark Eyes was released earlier, not because they were
        released at the same time
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Dark Eyes was released earlier than Awam based on their specific release
        months (May vs June 1987)

        for the NO answer. While it mentions that further research might be needed
        for exact dates within the year, the NO answer is based on the equality of
        the release years.

        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer ("Therefore, Dark Eyes was not released later than Awam"). The NO is
        directly based on the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note the years
        are the same (1987), this is irrelevant to the classification since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and explains that more information would be needed to determine
        which film was released earlier within 1987. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison without additional information.

        dates (Dark Eyes in May vs Awam in June 1987) and concludes Dark Eyes was
        released earlier
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" after

        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the release dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that "1996
        is earlier than 2000" and concluded that "Puratchikkaaran was released earlier
        than Joker." The NO answer was not justified by equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning that "Puratchikkaaran was released
        *earlier* than Joker." Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" as the model's answer since we're instructed to analyze only what
        was explicitly stated.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    006da80d-eccc-4f92-8f10-ebb7c5736fab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: For the German version case, the model states they
        were released in the same year (1951) and this equality is explicitly given
        as the reason for NO ("both films were released in the same year, making the
        answer NO"). For the French version case, the model identifies a difference
        (The River being earlier), so this isn't an equality-based NO. Since the model
        presents both cases and the NO applies to both, we cannot say the equality
        is the primary/only reason for the final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after analyzing
        both possible interpretations of Fanfares of Love (German or French version).
        The model gives a clear comparative answer in both cases.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    26a69cdd-4f1a-45c5-b1a6-05645e69719c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both films were released
        in 1951 (if considering the German version), this is not presented as the
        reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO answer is given due to ambiguity
        about which version is being referenced and inability to determine the exact
        order within 1951. The model does not explicitly state the releases were at
        the exact same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that The River and the German
        version of Fanfares of Love were released in the same year (1951), this is
        not presented as the reason for the NO answer. The model actually indicates
        uncertainty about which came first within 1951 ("Further research might be
        needed to determine which was released first in 1951"). The NO appears to
        be based on comparing against all versions of the film, not on equality of
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the release dates. While it notes some uncertainty about exact
        timing within 1951, it provides a clear NO response to whether The River was
        released later than Fanfares of Love.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does note both films were released in the same year (1951), this
        is not relevant since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer without more information" and indicates it needs more details
        to determine the order within 1951. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found different
        release months (September vs February) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that The River (September 1951) was released later than Fanfares of Love (February
        1951)

        must be False according to the criteria, regardless of the model noting that
        some versions were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gives a clear "YES" as its final
        answer, after discussing both versions but choosing to answer based on the
        French version it deemed more likely intended.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        "around the same time," it ultimately gives NO because it found specific dates
        showing The River was released earlier (September 1951 vs March 1952). The
        NO is not due to equal values, but due to finding a clear difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The River (September 1951) was released before Fanfares
        of Love (March 1952)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different values (1951 vs 1954) and explicitly states that one is "earlier
        than" the other. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "Therefore, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion
        after determining that 1951 is earlier than 1954.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: For the German version comparison, the model explicitly
        states that both films were "released in the same year" (1951) and this equality
        is given as the reason for the NO answer in that case. While it also provides
        an alternative scenario with the French version, the first comparison establishes
        equality as a reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative conclusion based on analyzing the release
        dates. The model provides this answer for both possible interpretations of
        which version is being compared.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in 1951" and uses this equality as the primary reason for concluding NO (that
        one is not later than the other). The NO answer is directly based on the films
        having the same release year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The River was not released later than Fanfares of Love.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        slightly before A Woman" and came out earlier in wide release. Since it identifies
        a difference in timing (even if slight), this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality (both being from 1953) was the primary reason
        for the NO answer. The model explicitly noted it couldn't determine if one
        was released earlier within that year, but the NO was based on their same-year
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates and determining it could not confirm one was later than
        the other.

    1cdce322-8a78-4ca0-b9f4-b2da003e9ffd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates for each
        movie (February 24 vs December 16, 1955) and says NO because The Sign of Venus
        was released earlier, not because the dates were the same. The values are
        explicitly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the release dates, providing an explicit NO answer to
        whether The Sign of Venus was released later than Heidi and Peter.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    2bc711f3-1d65-466e-b39a-3af591fb12bf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates
        (February vs December 1955) and determined that Heidi and Peter was released
        later than The Sign of Venus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Heidi and Peter was released later than The Sign of Venus. This appears
        to be a clear negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (February vs December 1955) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Sign of Venus was released
        earlier than Heidi and Peter.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1955, it identifies a specific difference in release dates (February vs December
        1955) and explicitly states one was released earlier than the other. The NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Sign of Venus was released earlier than Heidi and
        Peter

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were actually different (February
        vs December 1955), but that's not relevant to this classification since the
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after determining that Heidi and Peter was released in December while The
        Sign of Venus was released in February of the same year.

    98f98fce-ba18-427d-aa8b-cc6e4328aa98:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1955, it explicitly identifies different release dates (February 24th vs December
        10th) and does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. The presence
        of different dates means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 4, and this is a clear comparative result based on the dates it found
        (February vs December 1955)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that 1955 is earlier than 1958, showing a clear
        difference between the values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted
        both films were released in 1955 is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES." after comparing the release dates of the two films.

    ebbbe8f7-44d8-41b5-9fe1-c99819a007df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. In fact, it explicitly found different release dates (February
        24 vs December 1, 1955) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after finding that Heidi and Peter was released in December while The
        Sign of Venus was released in February of the same year.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f40dd061-ab33-4652-93ad-b5d1277463bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly indicated
        different values (1983 vs 1972).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that 1983 is later than 1972.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "both movies were released
        around the same time" when considering the 1988 releases, this is not given
        as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model first notes that 1988 is
        earlier than 1990, and the "not later" conclusion appears to be based on this
        comparison rather than on exact equality. Since the model identifies temporal
        differences and doesn't base its NO answer primarily on equality, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO response to the
        comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    09e492fc-5186-4953-986e-68cb1078ccb0:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in the same year" and uses this equality (both released in 1988) as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Therefore, The Crazy Companies was NOT
        released later than Dear Yelena Sergeyevna".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on analyzing the release years
        of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    114f7c5e-c649-4a75-ad7e-b6c547f78a7c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "Both were released in 1988" and
        uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer, explaining that
        since they were released the same year, one cannot be later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether The Crazy Companies was released later than Dear Yelena
        Sergeyevna.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates, making this a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "1988 is not later than
        1988", this is not the primary reason for its NO answer. The model actually
        bases its NO answer on the fact that there exists an earlier 1975 release
        date, making the comparison definitively negative rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this was a clear statement rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4a24db9a-b37b-4dfb-839d-083cdab19c08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually showed they were different (1981 vs 1988) and stated "1981
        is earlier than 1988".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that 1981 is earlier than 1988.

    84372c9e-605a-440d-9ae7-bac5160fa417:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that The Crazy Companies (1988) was released
        earlier than Dear Yelena Sergeyevna (1988/1990), indicating a difference in
        timing. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the release dates of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    97b1264f-469d-4125-a433-9f01fd1ae137:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The fact
        that the model noted both films were released "around the same time" is not
        relevant since this question only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more specific release date information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ba5aee4a-b3db-42a8-bdd3-88974af0540b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal as the
        reason for NO. Instead, it indicates that "The Crazy Companies" (1988) is
        earlier than "Dear Yelena Sergeyevna" (1988 or 1991), noting a difference
        in timing even in the 1988 case. The NO appears to be based on this difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f9bc5bef-5c47-432d-aa02-8da23dd13c37:

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (1970 vs 1976) and
        explicitly states "1970 is earlier than 1976" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates 1970 and 1976.

    33cfd7fe-577f-4bb4-89f9-5ada81827c22:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Tattooed Flower Vase (1964) was released EARLIER than Norman... Is That
        You? (1976), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states
        "1964 is earlier than 1976" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether one film was released
        later than the other. The model provides specific dates and a clear conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually showed that the dates were different (1974 vs 1976) and
        noted that 1974 is earlier than 1976.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning about the release dates.

    7987ab42-8940-4cec-8aeb-017a974ebad7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that 1970 is earlier than 1976, indicating a clear difference in values rather
        than equality. The NO is based on this difference, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step process and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model clearly found different
        values (1979 vs 1958) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states "1979 is earlier than 1983", showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both films were released
        in the same year (1950), it then found a difference in release months (January
        vs November) and explicitly stated Afsar was earlier. The NO answer was based
        on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Afsar was released earlier than Mark of the Gorilla, making this a clear
        negative comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1950, it explicitly states that one must have been released later than the
        other (unless released on exact same day). The NO answer is not based on the
        dates being equal - in fact, the model specifically says it needs more information
        to determine the exact order within 1950.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Afsar was released later than Mark of the Gorilla.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that both films were released
        in 1950, it found specific release dates showing they were different (January
        vs July) and this difference, not equality, was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Afsar was released earlier than Mark of the Gorilla, making this a clear
        comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1950), it explicitly states a difference in release dates
        (January vs October) and concludes that Afsar was released earlier. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" after
        determining that Afsar was released earlier than Mark of the Gorilla. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies were
        released in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason why
        one cannot have been released later than the other, leading to the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that both movies were released in 1950. This is a clear negative comparative
        answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both movies were released
        in the same year, it ultimately gives NO because it found Afsar was released
        earlier (January vs October), not because the dates were equal. The model
        explicitly states a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "1950 is earlier than
        1953" and gives NO as the answer. The values are not equal - they are different
        years (1950 vs 1953), and the model specifically notes this difference. Therefore,
        the NO answer is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates, making this a definitive NO response to
        the comparative question.

        explicitly states they were released in different months (January vs October)
        and uses this difference to conclude that Afsar was earlier. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

        dates were different ("November 9, 2018 is earlier than December 24, 2018").
        Since the NO answer was not based on equal values, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning which showed Autorsha
        was released before Click & Collect. Since we're instructed to focus on the
        explicit final answer rather than resolve contradictions, the answer is NO.

        24, 2018" and concludes that "Autorsha was released earlier than Click & Collect".
        The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own analysis, but we must
        evaluate only what was stated, not resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a step-by-step comparison of release dates. This is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that both films were released
        in 1962 in West Germany, this is not presented as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the model notes different release dates across regions (1962 vs 1964/1965)
        and bases its NO answer on this complex release pattern. The equality in West
        German release year is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is predominantly NO". While it discusses different release dates in
        different regions, it provides a clear final NO answer to the comparison.

        this sameness as the basis for concluding that one was NOT released later
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates that more information would be needed to determine

        did note the years were the same, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO

        in fact, it explicitly states "1992 is earlier than 1997" showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two movies.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that "Both movies were released
        in the same year," this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO is based on the inability to confirm if Pagaivan was released
        later ("it's not confirmed that Pagaivan was released later than Hideous!").
        The model explicitly states more information would be needed to determine
        the relative timing within the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While
        it mentions that one could have been released earlier in the year than the
        other, this is presented as an unknown possibility, not as an established
        difference. The primary reason for the NO answer is that they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the analysis of
        release dates, not as a statement about inability to determine or verify.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality of release years appears to be the primary
        reason for the NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information
        might exist, it bases its NO answer on the fact that they were released in
        the same year (1993).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

        did note the years were the same (1993), this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT ANSWER" and
        explains that while both were released in 1993, it cannot determine which
        was released later without more specific date information. This is a clear
        refusal to make the comparison.

        in their 1999 releases, this is not stated as the reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO appears to be because Bad Company's original release predates
        or is concurrent with Rockford, making it impossible for Rockford to be later.
        The model identifies a potential equality (concurrent release) but also mentions
        different release dates (1999 vs 2002), and the equality is not given as the
        primary reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        1978, it explicitly stated there was a difference in release dates (January
        vs October) and concluded La Zizanie was earlier. The NO answer was based
        on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that La Zizanie was released earlier than Germany in Autumn. This is a clear

        it mentions that further research would be needed to determine specific timing
        within the year, the primary reason for the NO answer is that they were released
        in the same year (1961).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        answer is not due to equal values, but appears to be responding to some other
        aspect of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model explains that since they were released in the same year (1961),
        one cannot be "later" than the other in terms of subsequent years. While it
        acknowledges uncertainty about specific dates within the year, the core reasoning
        for the NO is based on them being released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        both films were from 1976 is irrelevant since this question only applies when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after reasoning
        that while uncertain, since it needed to give a YES/NO answer and couldn't

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 1986 is earlier than
        1988, showing the values are different, not equal. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    e246fc6c-a3b4-4ad2-8023-e06eec463939:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states they are different (1986 is earlier than 1988).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO answer
        based on the comparison showing 1986 is earlier than 1988.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The dates were also different (December vs
        October 1966), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Winnetou and the Crossbreed (December 1966) was released after The Brides
        of Fu Manchu (October 1966)

    5fad7eee-c443-4280-9f4f-f645a0e73b09:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1965 is earlier
        than 1966" - indicating a difference between the dates. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and based on comparing specific dates (1965 vs 1966).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6f9f9d7c-b166-4922-9e37-dd51660b3f8e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model does note
        the films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final
        classification wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but qualifies it
        by saying it cannot determine which was released later due to lack of specific
        date information within 1966. Since this indicates an inability to make the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bb5f14ab-e363-4b92-a362-ef685e38474e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference in
        release dates (December vs October), but this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after determining
        that Winnetou and the Crossbreed was released in December 1966, which is later
        than The Brides of Fu Manchu's October 1966 release.

    fa3f4e10-a6c4-44b7-9932-f0b6dfac8e31:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        1966" and uses this same-year timing as part of its reasoning. However, the
        NO answer appears to be given because the model cannot confirm if one was
        released later than the other within that year, not because they were definitively
        released at the same time. The model explicitly states it's "possible" one
        was released later but can't confirm it.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative conclusion rather than
        a statement about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about specific timing within 1966, it provides "NO" as its definitive final
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1990, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (October 26 vs December
        7) and indicates that one was "before" the other. The NO answer is not based
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the release
        dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found different dates (September 14 vs December 7) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates and determining that December 7th is later than September
        14th.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in the same year, this is not relevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without more specific release date information.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1990, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (April vs December) and uses this
        difference to conclude NO. The NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal, but rather on finding a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Namma Ooru Poovatha was released earlier (April) than
        The Rookie (December)

        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates (October vs December 1990), but this is irrelevant since the answer
        wasn't NO

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1990, it explicitly states different release dates (August 10 vs December
        7) and this difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1990, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (August 10 vs December 7) and uses
        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but because one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Namma Ooru Poovatha was released earlier (August) than
        The Rookie (December)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. In fact, it explicitly states that while both films were released in
        1990, Namma Ooru Poovatha was released on October 26 and The Rookie on December
        7, showing they have different release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative response based on finding specific release
        dates and determining their order.

    4f3d212e-f7ed-4a49-85fc-186d52ecaffb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because 1953 is earlier
        than 1954, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states there is
        a difference between the dates ("1953 is earlier than 1954").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and not qualified with uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The fact that the model noted they were released
        in the same year is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning when
        the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that "Both films were released in
        the same year" and gave no other reason for its NO answer. The inability to
        determine which came first within 1954 reinforces that the equality of their
        release years was the basis for the NO answer. This matches the criteria for
        True - the values being compared (release years) are explicitly stated to
        be the same, and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the release dates, making this a clear NO answer. While it noted uncertainty
        about specific timing within 1954, it still provided a definitive NO response
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it couldn't determine.

        released in the same year, this wasn't used to support a NO comparative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this means it cannot definitively determine the order ("It's not possible
        to definitively say YES based on the information readily available"). This
        indicates the model is actually expressing inability to make the comparison

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end, even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one of the films. While
        it qualifies this answer with assumptions, it still provides a clear YES as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        didn't make an equality comparison anyway - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist, making a true comparison impossible. While it does say
        "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to
        make the comparison due to non-existence of one item, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model didn't
        compare equal values - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise since one of the films
        doesn't exist ("The Jade Pussycat seemingly doesn't exist"). While it does
        say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability
        to make the comparison due to non-existence of one item, which falls under

        (November vs December) and explicitly stated one was earlier than the other.
        The NO answer was not due to equal values, but because one preceded the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that The Glass Castle was released earlier
        than The West Point Story
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both films were released
        in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO
        answer, saying "Therefore, *The Glass Castle* was NOT released *later* than
        *The West Point Story*". The NO is directly based on the films having equal
        release years (1950).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the release dates it found.
        The answer is clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both movies were released
        in the same year (2003), it clearly states there is a difference in release
        dates (March 26 vs June 6) and uses this difference - not equality - as the
        basis for its NO answer. The NO is because Ned Kelly was released earlier,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ned Kelly was released earlier (March 26) than Ente
        Veedu Appuvinteyum (June 6), directly answering whether the first was released
        later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes different release dates (March
        2003 vs June 2003) and states that one was released before the other. The
        NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the release dates and making a clear comparison between
        the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films were
        released in the same year" and uses this equality (1972 = 1972) as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, explaining that one film was not released later
        than the other because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1972, it explicitly states it's answering NO based on the assumption they
        weren't released on the exact same day. The NO is not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on the assumption of different release dates within
        the same year. The model specifically says "assuming they weren't released
        on the exact same day."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty about the exact dates. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in 1972, it then finds specific months showing they were released at different
        times (May vs July). The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the release dates and determining that The Strange
        Vengeance of Rosalie (May 1972) was released before The Revengers (July 1972).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        1972, it does not use equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it
        explains that since they were released in the same year, one *might* have
        been later but it's not guaranteed - making it impossible to definitively
        say one was later than the other. The NO is based on lack of certainty about
        ordering within the same year, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While it explains some uncertainty about exact
        release dates within 1972, it provides a clear NO as its comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both films were released in
        the same year (1999), it found specific release dates showing they were different
        (March 26 vs December 22) and used this difference to reach its conclusion.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Foolish was released earlier than The Winslow Boy. This is a clear comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both films were released
        in 1954, it does not give a NO answer because they're equal. Instead, it investigates
        further and gives a NO answer because it found they were released in different
        months (September vs October), with Castellani's being earlier. The NO is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Castellani's film was released earlier than Nazarro's film. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.

        Bandhan was released on May 29, while A Hero Never Dies premiered earlier
        in May, concluding that A Hero Never Dies was likely released first. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.

        at the same time and that one could have been released later than the other.
        The NO answer was given due to lack of information to confirm YES, not because
        the release dates were determined to be equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it heavily qualifies this by saying it's only defaulting to NO
        because it cannot confirm YES. Since this NO is given as a comparative result
        (not as "NO, I cannot determine"), we should classify it as NO rather than
        UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates both films were released in March
        1974 and suggests they may have been "practically simultaneous." However,
        it does not explicitly state they were released on exactly the same date,
        and the NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty about specific dates
        rather than because of confirmed equality. The model's caveat about being
        "extremely close together" actually implies some difference, even if tiny.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it includes a caveat about potential simultaneous release. Since
        it provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability
        to determine, this should be classified as NO.

        equality as the reason for its NO answer. The identification of different
        release months means the values were not considered equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values comparison is
        not relevant since this wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the release dates, indicating that The Super Cops was released later than
        Penda's Fen.

    8e98632b-5407-43af-84d7-bab293acf77a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model does note both films
        were released in the same year, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot definitively say" one came after the
        other, not as a clear comparative result. This indicates inability to determine
        the order, making it effectively a statement of uncertainty rather than a
        comparative conclusion.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which was released earlier
        within the same year. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both films were released in
        the same year" and this equality of release years (1984) is the primary reason
        given for the NO answer. While it mentions that more specific date information
        might exist, the NO answer is based on the equality of the years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in 1984 ("in the same year") and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer ("Since they were released in the same year, Shanghai 13
        was NOT released later than Alphabet City").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the comparison
        because one film may not exist or its release date is unknown. Although it
        ends with "NO", this is a case where the model rejects the premise by indicating
        one film cannot be verified, making it impossible to compare release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1984 and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it mentions
        that more specific dates would be needed to determine exact order, the primary
        reason for the NO answer appears to be that they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1960, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (January 1 vs May 6) and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on Jaali Note
        being released before High Note, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Jaali Note was released on January 1, which is before
        High Note's May 6 release date. This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        Jaali Note was released later than High Note.

        answer, explaining that since they were released in the same year, one cannot
        be later than the other "in a general sense."

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1960, the model
        explicitly states they had different release dates (July vs September) and
        gives this difference as the reason for the NO answer, not because they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Jaali Note was released earlier (July) than High Note
        (September), not later as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both were released in 1960 and explicitly
        uses this equality as the basis for its reasoning. While it mentions needing
        "more information," the NO answer appears to be based on the fact that they
        were released in the same year, making it impossible for one to be "later"
        than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both films were released
        in 1992, it then found specific months (May vs November) and determined NO
        based on this difference, not because the values were equal. The NO was given
        because one was explicitly earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Khuda Gawah was released earlier than Minbo, making this a clear negative
        comparative answer.

        in the same year," it goes on to identify a specific difference in release
        months (May vs June 1992) and explicitly states that Khuda Gawah was released
        before Minbo. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on finding that Khuda
        Gawah was released before Minbo (May vs June 1992).
      final_answer: 'NO'

        did note both films were released in 1971, this is irrelevant since the final
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that without more precise release dates, it
        cannot determine which came first. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year" and uses this equality as the primary reason why
        one cannot be "later than" the other, leading to the NO answer. The model
        acknowledges that more granular data might exist but bases its NO answer specifically
        on their equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the release dates
        being in the same year.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that while both were released in 1971, The Bloodstained
        Butterfly was released first, indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states further research would be needed for exact months, so
        it's not definitively stating equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it explains this is because it cannot definitively confirm the later
        release date. Since the model expresses uncertainty about being able to determine
        the order, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the model noted
        the films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer based on the information currently available" and indicates it cannot
        determine which was released first without more specific dates within 1993.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1993, the model
        explicitly states different release dates (January 14 vs September 1) and
        uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Fight Back to School III (January 14) was released
        earlier than East Wind (September 1), not later.

        released in the same year (1993) and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for saying NO ("since 1993 is not *later than* 1993"). The NO answer is directly
        based on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, since 1993 is not *later
        than* 1993" when considering just the years. While it mentions needing more
        specific dates for a definitive answer, it provides a clear NO answer based

        East Wind, not on them being equal/same. Therefore, this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found specific
        different release dates (March vs May 1958), not because the values were equal.
        The model explicitly states one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer to the
        original question is NO" after determining that The Man Who Wouldn't Talk

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially noted both films were released
        in 1958, it then found specific months (March vs May) and gave NO because
        one was earlier than the other, not because they were equal. The final NO
        was based on a difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that "The Man Who Wouldn't Talk" was released in March, which is earlier than
        "Maigret Sets a Trap" released in May. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1958, the model
        specifically identifies different months (March vs May) and uses this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal, but rather on finding a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different release dates
        (March 1958 vs May 1958) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or the same, so this is not a case of equal
        values causing the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result showing that The Man Who Wouldn't

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model notes
        both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer is potentially
        YES", which is not a definitive YES answer. While it acknowledges both films
        were released in the same year, it states it cannot determine the exact order
        without month information, making this an uncertain conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the response wasn't about equal values - it was about one film not existing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films doesn't exist
        and therefore can't be compared, but ends with "NO." Since the model rejects
        the premise by stating one film doesn't exist, making comparison impossible,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't verify one of the
        films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and indicates it cannot make the comparison because one of the films appears
        not to exist. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the
        model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the films doesn't exist
        ("Union Leader" by Sanjay Patel), making the comparison impossible. While
        it gives a "NO" answer, this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question since one of the items being compared doesn't exist.

      result: UNKNOWN
    454e6e46-a6ad-46b2-aef6-08138a1aad41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        according to the criteria, this must be False. Additionally, even if we had
        considered the NO answer, the model found different values (2015 vs 2017),
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of two different films (2015 vs 2017). However,
        since the model rejects the premise by stating there is no film titled "Union
        Leader" by Sanjay Patel and substitutes a different film ("Sanjay's Super
        Team"), this falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN - where the model rejects
        the premises of the question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 2015 is earlier
        than 2017, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states "2015 is
        *earlier* than 2017" as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (2015 vs 2017) and
        stated "2015 is earlier than 2017" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the release dates of the two films, even though it
        had to make an assumption about which Sanjay Patel film to use.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's reasoning was about
        non-existence of one film rather than equal values anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that "Union
        Leader" doesn't exist, making a comparison impossible. While it does say "NO"
        at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make
        the comparison due to one film not existing, rather than making a comparative
        determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (2016 vs 2017) and
        explicitly states "2016 is earlier than 2017" as the reason for its NO answer.
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that one film was released
        in 2015 and the other in 2017, and notes that one was "earlier" than the other.
        The NO appears to be answering whether the second film was released earlier
        than the first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result after analyzing the release dates
        (2015 vs 2017). While the model notes that one of the films being asked about
        (Union Leader) doesn't exist and substitutes a different film, it still provides
        a clear comparative NO answer rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

        different release dates (2015 vs 2017), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states one date is "earlier than" the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing the release dates, making this a clear NO answer. While

        were equal. Instead, it explained that while one has a specific month (February
        1965) and the other only has a year (1965), it's possible The Wild Chase was
        released earlier in the year. The NO was due to inability to confirm the later
        release, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        is earlier than 1997". The values being compared were explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that 1995 is earlier than 1997.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both films were released in
        the same year (1997), it explicitly states that further research would be
        needed for exact dates and cannot definitively determine the order. The NO
        answer appears to be due to inability to confirm one came later than the other,
        not because they were definitively released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b9c73f5-1179-4480-a339-8998f13c2ac3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states "1995 is earlier than 1997", showing
        a clear difference between the dates. The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    990cc8ad-34b6-4e13-ac9a-611ae7c9f6ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not indicate the values were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that 1995 is earlier than 1997, showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the release
        dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d79df0a9-4210-4c5f-b9a1-098970131742:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not indicate
        the values were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated different years (1995
        vs 1997) and concluded that one was earlier than the other. The NO answer
        appears to contradict the analysis, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly
        stated without resolving contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, after providing a clear comparative analysis showing Omkaram was
        released earlier than Love! Valour! Compassion!'
      final_answer: 'NO'
