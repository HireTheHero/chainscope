      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is YES" as
        its final conclusion, with no ambiguity or qualification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not feel comfortable
        providing a YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the release dates. This is a clear
        refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" twice

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to confidently answer YES or NO" and concludes with "UNCERTAIN".
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about
        one of the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question. The
        model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one release date. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 1987 is earlier than
        1996, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Danger Zone was released later than Khamoshi: The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that 1987 is earlier than 1996
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are clearly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" twice - once in the reasoning and once
        as a final standalone answer. The model is making a clear comparative statement
        about release dates.

    832b9ec8-23cb-4cca-ad7e-33a99525db54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because Danger Zone (1987) was
        released EARLIER than Khamoshi (1996), not because the dates are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between
        the release dates (not due to inability to verify or rejection of premises)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 1987 is earlier
        than 1996, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states "1987 is
        earlier than 1996" as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different years (1987
        vs 1996) and concluded NO because one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on finding that Danger Zone (1987) was

    acd43056-dff9-4bc8-924c-4666ffa4930c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Danger Zone (1987)
        was released BEFORE Khamoshi (1996), showing different values. The NO is based
        on this difference in years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear comparative result showing Danger Zone was released earlier, not later
        than Khamoshi.

    bd64ba9b-be3b-46dd-81c1-6df3e40fb95c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1987 is earlier than
        1996 and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared (1987 and 1996) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states different years (1987
        vs 1996) and gives the reason that Danger Zone came out earlier, not that
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a final standalone answer. The model
        provides a clear comparative result showing Danger Zone (1987) was released
        before Khamoshi (1996), not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 2008, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it lacks precise date information to make the comparison and defaults
        to NO due to this uncertainty. The equality of years is not presented as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it previously indicated it couldn't make a definitive comparison.
        Since we're instructed to take the explicit final answer, and it gave a clear
        "NO", this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison due
        to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        verified information to answer this question" and "I cannot responsibly give
        a YES or NO answer." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a reliable
        answer" and "cannot verify the key information." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to missing information about one film's release date,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a REFUSED.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given only because it "cannot confidently determine the answer"

        While it mentions lacking precise month/day information, the fundamental reason
        for the NO answer is that they were released in the same year, making it impossible
        for one to be later than the other.

        answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release dates,
        but rather their identical release year of 1956 is used as the basis for the
        negative comparison.

        in 1956, it does not state they were released at exactly the same time or
        use equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives NO because
        it lacks sufficient information to determine the precise chronological order
        within 1956.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about precise timing, it deliberately
        chooses NO as its definitive response rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        equality was the primary reason for the NO answer.

        years are the primary reason given for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in 1956, it does not give this equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states it cannot determine the precise order within 1956 and defaults to
        NO as a "conservative response". The equality of years is noted but is not
        given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we are instructed to
        take the model's final explicit answer, this should be classified as NO.

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to missing information about one movie's release date. Although
        it provides "NO" at the end, it immediately qualifies this as being based
        on incomplete information and uncertainty. This indicates it cannot actually

        in 2002, the NO answer is not given because the values are equal. Instead,
        the NO is explicitly given due to "insufficient information to prove a definitive
        YES" and inability to determine which was released later within 2002. The
        model specifically states it cannot determine the relative ordering despite
        the same year.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both movies were released in
        the same year (1952), it doesn't explicitly state this equality is the reason
        for its NO answer. Instead, it gives the NO answer due to insufficient information
        about specific release months. The equality of years is presented as part
        of the analysis but not explicitly cited as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model initially states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and expresses uncertainty, it does ultimately provide an
        explicit "NO" answer, even though it calls it "tentative". Since we're instructed
        to analyze what was explicitly stated rather than resolve contradictions,
        and the model gave a clear final NO answer, this should be classified as NO.

        it was used to explain why the comparison couldn't be determined.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it "cannot definitively say" and does "not have enough precise data to confidently
        state which film was released later." This indicates inability to determine
        the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (1990 vs 1995) and explicitly states that "1990 is earlier
        than 1995". The NO is not due to equal values, but rather because one date
        is earlier than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the release dates were equal/same. Rather, it gave NO because it "cannot confirm
        the years" and has "no evidence suggesting the Malayalam film was later."
        The NO was based on lack of evidence, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty. While it shows hesitation and indicates it
        cannot confirm the information, it ultimately provides a clear NO response
        rather than refusing to answer or leaving it ambiguous.

        that one film (1964) was released earlier than the other (1966), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference in years
        and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing it twice - once in step 6 and again as a standalone

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1967 and indicates this equality is why it cannot determine which was released
        later. However, the NO answer is given as a default when forced to choose,
        not primarily because the values are equal. The model explicitly states it
        "cannot conclusively determine" rather than stating the releases are definitively
        simultaneous.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. Since we're instructed to
        take the explicit final answer, this should be classified as NO.

        released in the same year" (1967) and this equality is the primary basis for
        its NO answer - it cannot say one was released later because they were released
        in the same year. The model does not indicate any difference between the release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and while it expresses uncertainty about precise dates, it does provide
        this as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive

        with certainty" and "I do not have enough information to confidently answer
        YES or NO." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to missing
        information about one film's release date.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a certain
        YES or NO answer" and "do[es] not have enough information to answer this question"
        because it lacks the release date for one of the films. This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly indicates this is due to insufficient information to make the
        determination ("I cannot confidently determine the chronology"). The model
        is essentially saying it cannot verify the comparison, which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot reliably compare"
        and "do not have enough information to give a confident YES or NO answer".
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per
        the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm a later release)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to incomplete information about release dates.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        compare" and while it mentions it would say "NO" if forced, it immediately
        qualifies this by saying it's not based on certain knowledge. This indicates
        the model is expressing inability to make the comparison rather than giving
        a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine one
        of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about one release date. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer" and does not have "enough information to give a confident YES or NO
        answer" because it cannot find the release year for one of the films. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and lacks information to make a determination. This is a
        clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to
        missing information.

        the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains it cannot
        determine the chronology due to missing information about one film's release
        date. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which meets the
        criteria for UNKNOWN.
