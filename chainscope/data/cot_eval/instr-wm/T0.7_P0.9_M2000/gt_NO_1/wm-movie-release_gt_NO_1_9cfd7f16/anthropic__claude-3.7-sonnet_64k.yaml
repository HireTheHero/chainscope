        "A Woman" was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly states the

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that "A Woman" was

        on different dates: "Autorsha" on August 10, 2018 and "Click & Collect" on
        December 24, 2018. The model''s NO answer is based on the fact that "Autorsha"
        was released earlier than "Click & Collect," not that they were released at
        the same time.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Autorsha" was released earlier than "Click
        & Collect," not later, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        "Autorsha" was released later than "Click & Collect."

        dates are different, with "Autorsha" being released on November 23, 2018 and
        "Click & Collect" being released on December 24, 2018. The model's reason
        for the NO answer is that "Click & Collect was released later than Autorsha,
        not the other way around" - indicating a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Sujith Vaassudev's Autorsha released later than Ben Palmer's
        Click & Collect?" The model clearly provides a comparative result, determining
        that Autorsha was NOT released later than Click & Collect.

        EARLIER than "Green Hat." The NO answer is based on this difference in values,

        were released at different times - "That Lucky Touch" in May 1975 and "Journey
        Into Fear" in October 1975. The model concludes NO because "That Lucky Touch"
        was released EARLIER, not later than "Journey Into Fear." The model is noting
        a clear difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        "Was Christopher Miles's That Lucky Touch released later than Daniel Mann's

        Briand's Chaos and Desire?" The model clearly indicates that Blue Crush was
        released in August 2002, which is before Chaos and Desire was released in
        September 2002.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Blue Crush was released
        in August 2002 while Chaos and Desire premiered in September 2002, indicating
        a difference in timing. The model concludes that "Blue Crush was released
        EARLIER, not later" than Chaos and Desire, which is the reason for the NO
        answer.

        in August 2002 while "Chaos and Desire" was released in September/October
        2002. The model concludes that "Blue Crush came out first," indicating a difference
        in release dates, not equality. The NO answer is based on this chronological
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Blue Crush" was released later than "Chaos and Desire." The answer

        - specifically that it doesn''t believe "Upendra''s Omkaram" exists at all.
        The model states: "I don''t believe Upendra directed a film called ''Omkaram.''"
        This is not a claim of equality but a rejection of the existence of one of
        the comparison items.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Upendra's Omkaram" was not released later than Joe
        Mantello's "Love! Valour! Compassion!" because it doesn't believe Upendra
        directed a film called "Omkaram."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f254899f-f225-452d-9249-ad3ace269072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Om" was released in 1995
        while "Love! Valour! Compassion!" was released in 1997, and concludes that
        since 1995 comes before 1997, the answer is NO. The model is comparing different
        years, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Upendra's film was not
        released later than Joe Mantello's film.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
