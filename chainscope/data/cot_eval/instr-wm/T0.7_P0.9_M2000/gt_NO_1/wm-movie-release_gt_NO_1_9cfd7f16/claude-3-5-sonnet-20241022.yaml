      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (March 30 vs October
        30, 2007) and stated that Speed was released EARLIER than the other title.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as a clear comparative result after analyzing the release dates.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1b8cef17-e708-4c73-bafc-3ca77f27c47d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both were released in 2007, the model explicitly
        states they were released in different months (June vs October) and uses this
        difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on finding a specific difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Speed was released EARLIER than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume
        5. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

    21912ec9-9d19-4def-b7bc-aa0e15ae8fd9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both were released in 2007, this wasn't used to give a NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific month/date information. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    27122269-e1ff-49d1-939a-d3ec61aa1fa7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (March vs October 2007) and concludes NO because Speed was released
        EARLIER than the other title.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO (Speed was not released
        later than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5)" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both works
        were released in the same year, this is not relevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking precise release date information. While it
        notes both were released in 2007, it indicates it cannot make a determination
        without more specific dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both works were released
        in the same year (2007), and this equality is directly given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since both were released in the same year (2007), Speed
        cannot be released 'later than' the Looney Tunes collection")
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, based on its analysis that both works were released in
        the same year.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While both were released in the same year (2007),
        the model explicitly states they were released in different months (March
        vs October) and uses this difference to conclude that Speed was released earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a definitive comparative answer that Speed was not released later
        than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5. The answer is explicitly stated
        at the end.'

      explanation_equal_values: While both were released in 2007, the model explicitly
        noted a difference in release months (March vs October) and used this difference
        to reach its NO conclusion. The values were not equal, and equality was not
        the reason for the NO answer.

    ed095205-2c30-4871-bc6c-71ed379b0ba1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted both works were released in
        2007, it found a difference in specific release months (July vs October) and
        gave NO because Speed was earlier, not because they were equal/same
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after determining that Speed was released earlier than Looney

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films were
        released in the same year (1996)" and this equality is given as the reason
        for the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year...")

    22345345-36f5-42bf-b929-03a9ab0f8634:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note the years were the same (1996), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (since there isn't enough evidence
        to say it was released later)" and indicates it "cannot conclusively determine"
        the comparison. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot
        make the determination, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE THE
        ANSWER WITH CERTAINTY" and explains it cannot verify one of the release dates
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification as the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3bfc22ca-36b4-4c8b-856a-97e1a864c9b6:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films were released
        in the same year (1996), and this equality is the primary reason given for
        the NO answer ("Since both films were released in the same year (1996), Danger
        Zone cannot be released 'later than' Khamoshi").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the release years.

      result: UNKNOWN
    50b1d2c1-0aab-4639-a14b-0cb72577c6c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of verified information about one of the release
        dates. This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal
        to answer.

      result: UNKNOWN
    86058e11-4335-445a-96f7-541749245d97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both were released in 1996, it doesn't use equality as a reason for its answer
        - rather, it cites inability to determine relative timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because it "cannot determine with certainty" the relative
        timing, not as a definitive comparative result. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't verify one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "must abstain from
        giving a YES/NO answer" and "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer"
        due to insufficient information. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and explains it cannot make a definitive comparison due to

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted the years were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES/NO answer due to insufficient information." This indicates it cannot make
        the determination due to lacking specific release dates within 1996.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False per the criteria. While the model notes both
        films were released in 1981, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear

    4de873ec-dda7-4a9d-96a4-7d3d9275b70b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1964),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release months (April
        vs June) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not their
        equality. The model specifically says A Distant Trumpet was "earlier" than
        Gate of Flesh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - A Distant Trumpet was
        not released later than Gate of Flesh" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it found that A Distant Trumpet was released in May while
        Gate of Flesh was released in June, and concluded NO because A Distant Trumpet
        came before, not after, Gate of Flesh.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was directly based on finding
        that both films were released in "the same year (1964)", explicitly stating
        this equality as the reason why one could not be later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. While it notes both films were released in 1964, it identifies
        different months (April vs June) and bases its NO answer on A Distant Trumpet
        being released BEFORE Gate of Flesh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (A Distant Trumpet
        was not released later than Gate of Flesh)" as its final answer, providing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the release dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the order
        due to missing information about one release date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (as we cannot confirm that Dark
        Eyes was released later)" - this is explicitly indicating an inability to
        determine the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

    7039c89a-2a05-4aa6-b115-fe8bfea61c94:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it cannot determine the exact timing, rather than using
        equality as the reason for rejection.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but follows it with
        an explanation that it "cannot confirm" and "cannot be definitively said"
        which one was released later. This indicates uncertainty about the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model notes both films
        were released in 1987, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer - rather,
        it led to the model stating it couldn't determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient evidence
        to prove Dark Eyes was released later)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison. This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        notes both films were released in 1987, this wasn't used to justify a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer." This is
        a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        the NO answer ("since we cannot confirm Dark Eyes was released later than
        Awam, as they were released in the same year").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        The NO answer is directly based on the films having equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1987
        and uses this equality as the basis for its inability to determine if one
        was later. However, it does not explicitly state this equality as the reason
        for its NO answer - instead, it gives NO due to "no evidence that Dark Eyes
        was released later." The equality of years is presented as a reason for uncertainty,
        not as the direct reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes uncertainty about exact dates within 1987. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the model did note both films were released in 1979, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" due to insufficient information about release dates. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        for its NO answer ("Therefore Afsar was not released later than Mark of the
        Gorilla").

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        the same year (1950), and this equality of release years appears to be the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        between the release dates, only noting that more detailed timing information
        is lacking. The equality of the known values (year 1950) is the basis for
        the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the comparison. While it notes
        the uncertainty, it does provide a clear NO as the required answer, so we
        should classify based on this explicit final answer rather than the expressed
        uncertainty.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of the fact that the model noted both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific date information within 1950. This
        indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive
        answer.

    4bdf65fe-7d89-42b2-b7c6-0ed16f0aecd0:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (1950), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it with "(there is insufficient evidence to say Afsar was released later than
        Mark of the Gorilla)". This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

    8332aafa-6533-43fb-b491-dcf36bdf215a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1950
        and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model explicitly
        notes it cannot determine any difference in release dates because they were
        released "in the same year," making the equality of release years the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a "cannot determine"
        statement). While the model expresses uncertainty about specific dates, it
        provides a clear NO answer to whether one film was released later than the
        other.

        notes both films were released in 1950, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model notes
        both films were released in 1950, it doesn't use equality as a reason for
        its answer - instead stating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the chronological order due
        to having only year-level data. Since the model states it "cannot verify"
        the comparison and "cannot make a clear YES/NO statement," this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria, despite the "NO" at the end.

        the NO answer ("since we cannot confirm Afsar was released later than Mark
        of the Gorilla, as they were released in the same year"). The equal release
        year is the primary basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on both films being released in
        the same year. The answer is not a refusal or inability to determine - it's
        a definitive NO based on the comparison.

        was released in August while Click & Collect was released in December - explicitly
        different dates. The NO was not due to equal values, but because one date
        clearly came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Autorsha was released

        both movies were released in 2001, it explicitly states it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison, not that they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially expresses uncertainty but then
        explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer, even though it qualifies this
        with low confidence. However, since the model states it "cannot make a definitive
        comparison" and "cannot provide a clear YES or NO answer", this falls under
        the UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates it cannot make
        the comparison.

        2001 and explicitly uses this equality ("both films were released in the same
        year") as the primary reason for its NO answer. The model even emphasizes
        that any potential slight differences within the year don't affect this conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The fact that both
        movies were released in 2001 is not relevant to this classification since
        we're only evaluating equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive

        explicitly states they were released in different months (September vs October)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer was not due
        to equal values, but rather due to a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        (April 1 vs April 21) and gave the reason for NO as being that Natural Born
        Pranksters was released earlier, not later.

        year (1993), but this is not given as the primary reason for the NO answer.
        Instead, the NO is given because there isn't enough information to verify
        one came later than the other. The model explicitly states "without more specific
        release date information, we cannot say Perfect Exchange was released later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses uncertainty about the exact timing, it provides this
        as a definitive comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        by saying it "cannot be definitively said" that one was released later than
        the other due to lack of exact dates. This indicates uncertainty about making
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        the comparison due to insufficient information.

        leading to its NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference between
        the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it explains it cannot confirm which was released later, it still

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        answer as NO, the model notes equal values (both released in March 1978) but
        doesn't use this equality as the reason for saying NO - instead it cites inability
        to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately qualifies this with uncertainty about being able to determine
        the order ("I cannot prove this with certainty"). This indicates the model
        cannot actually determine the comparison, making this effectively a statement
        of inability to verify rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1952, the model
        explicitly states they were released in different months (April vs December)
        and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that "Cruise of the Zaca"
        was released earlier, not later than "Sky Full of Moon"

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in the same year (1952),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference in release months (January
        vs December) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The
        values are not equal, and the NO is not based on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Cruise of the Zaca was released earlier
        than Sky Full of Moon, not later.

        in fact, it explicitly states there is a 6-month difference between release
        dates (June 1952 vs December 1952). The NO answer is given because one came
        before the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Cruise of the Zaca was not released later than Sky Full of Moon. This
        is a direct NO answer to a comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (1952) and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
        The model doesn't note any difference between the release dates, only that
        they are in the same year, and this sameness is explicitly cited as the reason
        for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, and
        this NO is given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability to determine).
        While the model notes some uncertainty about exact dates, it provides a clear
        NO answer to whether Flynn's film was released later.

        1969, this wasn't used to give a definitive NO answer - rather, it led to
        uncertainty about the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot confirm that
        Jacobs's film was released later)" - this is indicating an inability to determine/verify
        the comparison, not a comparative result. The model explicitly states earlier

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found that the dates were different
        (2004 vs 2005) and gave NO because one was earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through the comparison and
        explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer, comparing the release dates of
        2004 vs 2005 and determining that Sepet was released earlier, not later.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 2004 comes before
        2005, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer was given because
        one value precedes the other, not because they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Sepet was NOT released later
        than A Love to Hide, after comparing their release dates of 2004 and 2005.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about specific release dates.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1957,
        but this is not given as the reason for the NO answer. Instead, the NO is
        because it "cannot verify this with certainty" due to lacking month/day information.
        The equality of years is noted but is not the primary reason for the negative
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. While it explains it cannot verify the exact timing, it still provides
        NO as a direct comparative answer rather than indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had classified the final
        answer as NO, the model notes both were released in the same year but explicitly
        states it lacks the specific date information to make a determination - it's
        not stating equality as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot determine the order due to lack of
        specific release date information ("I cannot definitively say one was released
        later than the other"). This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year (1957)" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer ("Since they were released in the same year, Piker's Peak cannot
        be released 'later than' Hour of Decision"). The NO answer is directly based
        on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, NO"
        as its comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model's reasoning was about insufficient evidence
        to determine the order, not about the dates being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot determine" the relative timing due to insufficient
        evidence. When a model states it cannot determine or verify the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO, even if "NO" was stated.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        one of the films to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot confirm" and indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because one film appears not to exist. This
        is a case where the model rejects the premise of the question since one film
        cannot be found, making it impossible to compare. Per the guidelines, when
        a model rejects premises or indicates it cannot determine/verify, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        year (1950), and this equality is explicitly given as the reason why one cannot
        be "later" than the other. The inability to determine which came later is
        directly attributed to them having the same year value.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        it as a direct comparative answer, even though it also notes uncertainty about
        specific dates within the year. Since it gives a clear NO as its final comparative
        conclusion, this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the years were the same (1991), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively say...)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The parenthetical clarification
        shows this is about inability to verify rather than a clear comparison.

        The model concludes that one came before the other, not that they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        explanation that Romeo and Juliet was released earlier than The Black Dakotas,
        not later. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

        same month but doesn't claim equality as the reason for the NO - instead citing
        insufficient information to determine order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" but when forced to give only YES/NO, it explicitly states
        "NO (but with very low confidence)". Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about exact dates, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        both films were released in September 1954, it does not use equality as a
        reason for its answer, but rather states it lacks sufficient information to
        make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates it cannot make a definitive
        determination, but when pressed for a YES/NO answer, provides "NO (but with
        low confidence due to incomplete information)". Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot determine the comparison and qualifies its NO answer with
        uncertainty about being able to verify, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        as final, it wasn't given because the values were equal - the model actually
        stated it couldn't determine the order due to lack of exact dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and only gives NO
        "if forced to choose" with "low confidence". This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a clear comparative conclusion, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        1954) and concludes that The Black Dakotas was released after Romeo and Juliet,
        making the comparison definitively unequal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Romeo and Juliet

        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO". This indicates it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response since it's specifically about inability
        to verify rather than rejecting the comparison entirely.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same, this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because there isn't enough evidence
        to say it was released later)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison.
        This is effectively saying "NO, I cannot determine" which meets our criteria
        for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model notes both films were released in 1960, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific timing details. It indicates it
        cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on the fact that both
        films were released in the same year (1960), explicitly stating "both films
        were released in the same year (1960)" as the reason for the negative comparison.
        The equality of the release dates was the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did note both
        films were from 1960, this wasn't used to give a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION to answer YES
        or NO." This indicates it cannot make the determination, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a REFUSED response since it's specifically about inability
        to verify rather than refusing to compare.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific month/day release date information.
        This indicates inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or clear
        YES/NO answer.

        were released in the same year, this wasn't used as the primary reason for
        a NO answer - rather, the inability to determine the order was the key factor.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it with "(because we cannot confirm Asura was released later)"
        which indicates it cannot make the determination. This is equivalent to saying
        "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains it cannot determine
        the order without specific release dates within 2001. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a conclusive
        YES or NO answer" and ends with "CANNOT DETERMINE" because it lacks specific
        release date information within 2001. This is a clear case where the model

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        2001 and explicitly uses this equality ("both films were released in the same
        year") as the basis for its NO answer. The inability to determine which came
        later due to their same release year is the primary reason given for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        identified different months (May vs September) and explicitly stated this
        difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values were not equal, and
        the NO was based on Khuda Gawah being released before Minbo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        the model did note the years were the same (1993), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and that "this question cannot be answered with the available

        NO answer, stating "since the question asks if one was released 'later than'
        the other, and they were released in the same year, it cannot be 'later than'"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Parama (1984) was released before Paartha Gnabagam Illayo (1985), not
        because the values were equal. It explicitly shows different years and states
        "1984 comes before 1985".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Parama was not released

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films were released
        in different years (1984 vs 1985) and the NO was because one came before rather
        than after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Parama was released earlier (1984) rather than later than Paartha Gnabagam
