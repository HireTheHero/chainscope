      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        release date (October 19) was earlier than the other (October 30), not because
        they were equal. The model explicitly identified a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that Speed was released on October 19, which is earlier than October 30. This
        is a definitive comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states different dates (October 19 vs October 30, 2007)
        and uses this difference to make its determination. The NO answer is based
        on Speed being released before, not on equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Speed was not released
        later than Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that "Speed" was released before the Looney Tunes
        collection (October 19 vs October 30, 2007). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different dates (October
        19 vs October 30) and indicates that "Speed" was released before the other
        title. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates and finding
        that Speed was released before the Looney Tunes collection.

      explanation_equal_values: While both movies were released in 1996, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (January 17 vs August 9)
        and notes that August 9 is later than January 17. The NO answer is not due

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both movies were released in
        the same year" and explicitly uses this equality (1996 = 1996) as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "neither was released later than the other."

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both films were
        released in the same year, 1996" and uses this equality as the basis for its
        NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release dates,
        but rather their identical release year is the primary reason given for the
        negative comparison.

        dates, but rather states they are the same year and uses this equality as
        the reason for saying NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot conclusively
        answer YES or NO to this question" because it lacks the specific release date
        for one of the movies. This indicates an inability to make the comparison
        due to insufficient information.

        While it mentions not having specific dates within the year, the NO answer
        is primarily based on the equal release years.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explains this is because
        it cannot determine which was released later due to lack of specific dates
        within the same year. Since the model is indicating it cannot make the determination,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria ("The model indicates

        since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO; we cannot confirm that
        The River was released later than Fanfares of Love." Since this is explicitly
        stating an inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative

        years are the primary basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the release years. While it
        notes that more information would be needed for specific dates within the

        in 1951, it does not give NO because they were equal - rather, it gives NO
        because it found a specific difference (January vs September release dates).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So, the answer is NO" after

        1983" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer. It explicitly
        notes they were "released in the same year" and this sameness is the basis
        for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear and direct response to whether one film was released
        later than the other.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        the years were the same (1983), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer. The model explicitly
        states it lacks the specific release dates needed to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False, regardless of the fact that the
        model noted both films were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that while both films were released in 1983,
        it cannot determine which came later without specific release dates within
        that year.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (the model
        found different release dates in 1983).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

        While it mentions that exact dates within the year are unknown, the equal
        year values are explicitly cited as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it notes uncertainty about exact dates within 1988. Since

        at the same time. In fact, it explicitly identifies different release months
        (July vs February 1979). While both films were released in the same year,
        the model clearly establishes a temporal difference between them. Therefore,
        the NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion regarding whether "Unidentified Flying Oddball" was released
        later than "Rope and Skin". However, this appears to be an error in the model's
        logic, as it first establishes that "Unidentified Flying Oddball" was released
        in July 1979 while "Rope and Skin" was released in February 1979, which would
        actually make "Unidentified Flying Oddball" later. Despite this logical inconsistency,
        we must classify based on the explicit final answer given.

        being released in the same year (1979), stating "neither was released later
        than the other based on available information" because they share the same
        year. The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO

        the years were the same (1979), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as a reason for NO answers.

        the comparison is based on the equal year values, making this a case where
        the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        on the equality of the release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the films
        were released at different times (January vs June 2004) and used this difference
        to reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        and explicitly uses this equality as the reason for the NO answer, stating
        "Since both films were released in the same year, 2004, neither was released
        later than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both movies were released in 2004
        and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. While it
        mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 2004, the primary reason
        for the NO answer is that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, though it notes uncertainty about specific dates within 2004. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        year is mentioned but doesn't change that the equality of years is the main
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" and

        on the year." The NO answer is directly based on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the model did note both films were released in the same year, this is irrelevant
        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" which indicates
        it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as per

        vs 1973) and stated "1974 is later than 1973". The NO answer wasn't based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own reasoning (since it showed 1974

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in release years (1981 vs 1982) and that one film was released earlier than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates and determining that Maria, Mirabela (1981)
        was released earlier than If You Could See What I Hear (1982).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both films were released
        in the same year (1965), it does not give a NO answer because they are equal.
        Instead, it determines that Les Bons Vivants was released on November 5, while
        The Nanny was released on October 7, finding a clear difference in dates.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        claim the release dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative order due to incomplete information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "we cannot definitively say" and "without more specific release date
        information." This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison, making
        it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1997
        and explicitly uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model
        does not indicate any difference between the release dates - rather it states
        they "share the same release year" and uses this sameness as the reason for
        concluding NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the same release year. While
        it mentions uncertainty about specific dates within 1997, it gives a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the model explicitly states it cannot determine which was released later due
        to lacking more specific dates, rather than claiming they were released at
        exactly the same time. The equality of the year is not presented as the definitive
        reason for the NO answer, but rather the inability to determine the order.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model notes they share the same
        year but explicitly states this is insufficient to make the comparison, rather
        than using the equality as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by stating they cannot confirm the comparison. This indicates they cannot
        determine the answer, making it effectively a statement of inability to verify

        only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot determine" and explains

        in fact, it explicitly states that one film was released in 1995 and the other
        in 1993, showing a difference in values. The NO appears to be given because
        the comparison shows "Bloodfist VI" came after "Brave", not because the dates

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed since
        it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        stated different release dates for the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both films were released in
        the same year, 1968" and concludes "neither film was released later than the
        other." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of the release years.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model did
        note the years were the same (1968), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate
        equality as the reason for a NO answer when the final answer is actually NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (we cannot determine
        which was released later based solely on the years provided)" which indicates
        it cannot make the determination. This is a case where the model explicitly
        states it cannot verify/determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both movies were released in 1986
        ("the same year") and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer, indicating
        it cannot determine if one was released later than the other because they
        were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        released in the same year" and gives this equality as the reason for its NO
        answer ("Since both films were released in the same year, technically neither
        was released later than the other"). The NO answer is directly based on the

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is directly based on both films
        being released in the same year (1986). The equality of release years is explicitly
        stated ("Both films were released in the same year, 1986") and is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        between the release dates, only that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, providing
        a clear comparative result based on both films being released in the same
        year. While it mentions uncertainty about specific release dates, it gives
        a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model notes both
        films were released in 1986, this equality was not used to give a comparative
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot ascertain that 'Where
        Are the Children?' was released later" - this is indicating an inability to
        determine the comparison, not a comparative result. The model explicitly mentions
        lacking specific release dates and being unable to make a definitive comparison.

        ("the same year") and this equality is the primary basis for the NO answer.
        While it mentions that specific release dates within the year could potentially
        differ, it bases its NO answer on the equal release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model notes they were released in the same year
        but explicitly states it lacks information about specific dates to make the
        comparison, rather than using equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the order due to lacking specific
        release dates within 1986. Since the model states it "cannot definitively
        say" and the NO appears to mean "cannot verify" rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        since the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot confirm..." which
        indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific release dates.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values (dates) were equal. The model explicitly states different dates
        (July 21 vs July 27, 1956) and indicates that Barbary-Coast Bunny was released
        earlier than In the Bag. The NO answer was based on this difference in dates,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Barbary-Coast Bunny was released later than In the
        Bag. The model provides specific dates and makes a direct comparison showing
        Barbary-Coast Bunny was released earlier.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in release dates (July
        21 vs July 27, 1956) and concludes that one was released earlier than the
        other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the release dates, where it found that Barbary-Coast
        Bunny was released earlier than In the Bag.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one date (July 21) is earlier than the other date (July 27), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference between the dates
        and bases its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates,
        providing an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model found specific dates for both movies
        in 1999 (September 3 vs March 10), it did not state they were equal - in fact,
        it explicitly noted that "Bad Company was released before Rockford." The NO
        answer was not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether Rockford was released later than Bad Company, even though
        its reasoning actually supports a "YES" answer (since it found that Bad Company
        was released first). Despite this logical inconsistency, we must classify
        based on the explicit final answer given.

        in 1999 ("both films were released in the same year") and this equality is
        the primary reason given for the NO answer ("Since both films were released
        in the same year, 'Rockford' was not released later than 'Bad Company.'").

        the model did note the years were the same (1999), this is irrelevant since
        the final answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and "cannot answer with a clear YES or NO" due to having only year-level data
        without specific release dates. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        since the final answer wasn't classified as NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        provides a reasoning that indicates it cannot determine the actual order due
        to lack of specific release dates. Since the model states it "cannot definitively

      explanation_equal_values: While both films were released in 1978, the model
        explicitly states different specific release dates (March 22 vs February 28)
        and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The values are not equal,
        and equality is not the reason for the NO answer - in fact, the model concludes
        NO because one date is earlier than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result based on specific release dates (March
        22 vs February 28, 1978). The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparison.

        is the primary reason given for the NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model does note
        the years are the same (1978), this is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of specific month/day
        information. This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot make
        the determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

        answer, stating "neither was released later than the other." While it mentions
        uncertainty about specific dates within the year, the equality of the release
        years is presented as the main basis for the NO answer.

        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine which film was
        released later, making this effectively a statement of inability to compare.
        When a model states it cannot determine or verify the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        released in the same year, 1989" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference between the release
        dates, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        the model notes both films were released in 1989, this wasn't used to justify
        a NO answer.

        answer YES or NO" and indicates it needs more specific date information to
        make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the determination.

        states they lack specific date information to make the comparison, not that
        they are definitively released on the same date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" but
        qualifies this with uncertainty about specific release dates. Since the NO
        is given because they cannot determine the order (not as a comparative result),
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN. The response essentially states they
        cannot make the determination.

        presented as the primary reason for the NO answer - rather, the model notes
        that without specific dates, a precise comparison isn't possible. The equality
        of years is presented as contextual information rather than the decisive factor
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, 'Maxed Out' was not
        released later than 'The Journals of Knud Rasmussen'" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about making a definitive comparison.
        Since it provided this explicit NO answer, we classify based on that final
        statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference in release dates (March vs
        September 2006) and concluded one was later than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that "The Journals of Knud Rasmussen" was
        released later than "Maxed Out"

        answer on Ned Kelly being released earlier, not on the dates being equal.
        The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly comparing the release dates and determining that Ned Kelly was
        not released later than Ente Veedu Appuvinteyum.

        it mentions not having specific release dates, the primary reason for the
        NO appears to be that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative result (responding to whether one was
        released later than the other). While the model notes it cannot determine

        equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot conclusively say that
        Asura was released later than Brigham City" which indicates it cannot determine

        answer ("neither was released later than the other based solely on the year").
        The inability to determine specific dates within 1958 doesn't change that
        the NO answer is primarily based on the equal release years.

        The equality of release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (one day difference
        was noted).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is YES" and clearly stated that Dr. Terror's House
        of Horrors was released later than The Wild Chase.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (one day difference
        was found).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 'Dr. Terror's
        House of Horrors' was released later than 'The Wild Chase'" after determining
        specific release dates showing a one-day difference.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not applicable
        when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its step-by-step analysis, after comparing the release dates
        of both films.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different dates (February
        22 vs February 27, 1965) and explicitly states that Dr Terror's House of Horrors
        was released first. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not
        on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically addressing whether Dr Terror's House of Horrors was released
        later than The Wild Chase. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d80e585-ac1b-42a6-a019-13dab19f72c0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly identifies different dates (February 16
        vs February 27, 1965) and states that "The Wild Chase" was released later
        than "Dr. Terror's House of Horrors." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release
        dates. This is a clear NO answer to whether the first film was released later
        than the second.

    73d0a4d5-f2bd-4d76-bea9-eb085384ee0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a one-day difference
        between the release dates (February 27 vs February 28), with The Wild Chase
        being released earlier. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on the release dates it identified.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a 5-day difference between
        the release dates, with one being earlier than the other. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Dr. Terror's House of Horrors was released 5 days
        earlier than The Wild Chase. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    dba244fb-3a2a-4073-ad33-0eb52b2b1ee9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states different dates (February 5 vs February 27,
        1965) and concludes that "The Wild Chase" was released later than "Dr Terror's
        House of Horrors".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model did note both films were released in 1997, this wasn't used to give
        a definitive NO answer, but rather to explain why it couldn't make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, based on available information,
        we cannot definitively say..." This is a statement about the model's inability
        to determine the comparison, not a comparative result. This falls under the
        UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot make the comparison."
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    4adb633a-899c-412e-a42a-43ec74cbdbd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different release dates (1995 vs
        1997) and determined that one was earlier than the other. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Omkaram was released in 1995 and Love! Valour!
        Compassion! in 1997. This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.

    8edfeb7d-22c7-48c3-848f-1dce7eac8906:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values criteria only apply when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    bddf40b6-b1bc-45e5-8042-64952d85869e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of the
        fact that the model noted both movies were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it concludes that "the answer is uncertain" and "cannot be definitively
        answered with a YES or NO based on the information available." This indicates
        inability to make the comparison due to lack of specific release dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the release dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states different dates (April 11, 1997 vs May 16,
        1997) and concludes that "Omkaram was released before Love! Valour! Compassion!"
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Upendra's 'Omkaram'
        was not released later than Joe Mantello's 'Love! Valour! Compassion!'" as
        its final answer. This is an explicit NO in response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in 1997
        and explicitly uses this equality ("neither was released later than the other")
        as the primary reason for its NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model actually found different release
        dates and determined one was later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "So, the answer
        is YES" after determining that Omkaram (December 1997) was released later
        than Love! Valour! Compassion! (May 1997)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different years (1995 vs 1997) and
        used this difference to reach its conclusion
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates (1995 vs
