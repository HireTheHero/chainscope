      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

        is what led to the UNKNOWN classification, not a definitive NO answer based
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (not definitively
        determinable based on the given information)." This indicates the model cannot
        determine which film was released later because it only has the year (1981)
        for both films but lacks the specific release dates needed to make a definitive

        on the fact that the release years are identical (both 1981), and without
        more specific date information, the comparison cannot be made. This is a case

        Additionally, the model noted that both films were released in the same year
        (1981), but couldn't determine which came later without exact release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" because it states
        "the safest answer is NO because we cannot confirm that Asso was definitively
        later." However, this is actually an UNKNOWN response because the model is
        saying it cannot determine which film was released later without exact release
        dates. The model is not definitively stating that Asso was NOT released later
        than Kalankini Kankabati, but rather that it cannot verify the comparison.

        years is the primary reason for the NO answer, as the model states "both films
        share the same release year without further details" and concludes there is
        "no definitive evidence that Asso was released later." The model does not
        note any difference in values but rather emphasizes their equality.

        same release year, it cannot determine which came later without exact dates.

        The model determined that both films were released in the same year (1981)
        and without exact dates, it cannot confirm that Asso was released later than
        Kalankini Kankabati.

        was released in December while "The Sign of Venus" was released in March,
        making "Heidi and Peter" released later. The model is giving NO as an answer
        because it found a difference in release dates, not because they are equal.

        different times - "The Sign of Venus premiered on March 4, 1955" while "Heidi
        and Peter premiered on December 16, 1955". The model's NO answer is based
        on the fact that The Sign of Venus was released earlier (in March) than Heidi
        and Peter (in December), not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, The Sign of Venus
        was not released later than Heidi and Peter" as its final answer. This is

        is explicitly that both films were released in the same year (1955). In step
        4, it states "Since both were released in the same year, without specific
        release dates, we can't definitively say one was later than the other." This
        clearly indicates that the equality of release years is the primary reason
        for the NO answer.

        in the same year (1985), "Family Life" was released in September 1985 whereas
        "The Woman and the Stranger" premiered in February 1985. The model's NO answer
        is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        then determines specific release dates within that year (February vs May)
        and concludes that "Family Life" was released later. The NO answer is based

        "The Woman and the Stranger" premiered in February 1985 while "Family Life"
        premiered in May 1985. The model concludes that "The Woman and the Stranger"
        was released EARLIER than "Family Life" (not the same time), which is why
        it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model concludes "NO" because there is no conclusive evidence that Afsar
        was released later than Mark of the Gorilla. The model is essentially saying
        they cannot determine which was released later because they have the same
        release year and lack specific dates. This is not stating they are exactly
        equal, but rather that there's insufficient information to determine the order.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it cannot determine
        which film came later, not because the values are exactly equal. While the
        model notes both films were released in the same year (1962), it explicitly
        states it would need "specific release months or dates" to make a determination.
        The model is not claiming the release dates are identical - it's stating it
        lacks sufficient information to determine which came later. The NO is due
        to inability to confirm the comparison, not due to equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model reaches this conclusion after determining
        it cannot confirm that "We Joined the Navy" was released later than "Sherlock
        Holmes and the Deadly Necklace" because both films were released in the same
        year (1962) and it lacks information about specific release months or dates.

        The model states "YES, La Zizanie was released earlier than Germany in Autumn,
        meaning La Zizanie was not released later." This is contradictory since saying
        "YES" would mean agreeing that La Zizanie was released later, but the explanation

        films were released in 1952, meaning neither was released later than the other
        in terms of year alone." This explicitly states that the values being compared
        (release years) are the same, and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.

        cannot determine which came later. The equality of the release years (both
        being 1952) is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        were released in the same year (1952), and it explicitly states "Since both
        films were released in the same year..." as the reason for its conclusion.
        The model indicates the values (release years) are identical, and this equality
        is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer and explicitly states
        that both films were released in the same year (1952). The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that both films have equal release years, and without
        more specific release dates, it cannot determine if one was released later
        than the other. The equality of the release years is the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. While the model explains that both films were released
        in the same year (1952) and that specific release dates would be needed to
        determine which came later, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer to
        whether Errol Flynn's Cruise of the Zaca was released later than Sky Full
        of Moon.

        if both were in 1952, we cannot conclusively say *Cruise of the Zaca* was
        released later than *Sky Full of Moon*." The NO answer is given precisely
        because the values being compared (the release years) are the same, and without
        more specific date information, equality is the reason for the negative answer.

        December 5, 1952, while Errol Flynn's Cruise of the Zaca has an unknown specific
        release date within 1952. The model says "NO" because it cannot definitively
        determine that Cruise of the Zaca was released later than Sky Full of Moon,
        not because they were released on the same date.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the best answer is NO"
        at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model
        cannot determine which film was released later because it only has the year
        (1952) for both films but not the exact release dates. This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        at different times - "The Young Doctors" in July 1961 and "Ada" in August
        1961. The model's NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Ada" was released later (August 1961) than "The Young Doctors" (July
        1961) and explicitly concluded with "NO" as its answer.

        equal - in fact, it found that the movies were released on different dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Young Doctors" was released after "Ada" (September

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        on different dates (March 8, 1998 vs. May 29, 1998) and concludes that "Silencing
        Mary was released earlier than Thulli Thirintha Kaalam." The NO answer is
        based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Silencing Mary was released later than Thulli Thirintha
        Kaalam. The model provides a definitive comparative judgment with a clear
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because both movies
        were released in the same year (1998), and it explicitly states "Both movies
        were released in 1998." The model indicates it cannot determine which came
        later because they were released in the same year, and without specific dates,
        it cannot confirm that Silencing Mary was released later. The equality of
        release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Silencing Mary was released later than Thulli Thirintha Kaalam.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is directly based on the fact
        that both movies were released in the same year (1998). The model explicitly
        states "Both movies were released in the same year (1998)" and concludes that
        "Since they share the same release year... neither can be said to be definitively
        later." The equality of release years is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" at

        model did note that the movies were released in the same year, but it did
        not give a definitive NO answer based on this equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" after explaining that both movies were released in the same
        year (1998) and that without precise dates, it cannot determine which came
        later. This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

        it led to uncertainty about which came first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (since I cannot confirm
        that it was released later)". This indicates the model cannot determine the
        answer due to lack of information about exact release dates, making this an
        UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result. The parenthetical

      explanation_equal_values: The model does NOT give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. While it initially notes both were released in the same year
        (1974), it then provides more specific information about release dates within
        March. The model explicitly states that "The Super Cops was released earlier
        in March" compared to "Penda's Fen was broadcast on March 21, 1974." The NO

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that Shanghai
        13 was released earlier in 1984 than Alphabet City (which was released in
        April 1984). The model's NO answer is based on this difference in release
        timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Shanghai 13 was released
        earlier than Alphabet City in 1984, and therefore answered "NO" to the question
        of whether Shanghai 13 was released later than Alphabet City.

        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1984),
        but this wasn't the basis for a definitive NO answer - rather it led to the
        model's inability to determine which was released later without specific dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" with the explanation
        that "we cannot confirm that Shanghai 13 was definitively released later."
        This is a case where the model is saying it cannot determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria. The model is not
        making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it lacks information
        to make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer primarily because it cannot
        determine which film came later, not because it's stating the films were released
        at exactly the same time. The model states "both films were released in the
        same year (1984)" but then explains "without specific release dates, we cannot
        definitively say that one was released later than the other." The model is
        indicating uncertainty about the relative timing rather than equality of release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that both films were released in the same year (1984)
        and that without specific release dates it cannot determine which came later,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the question of whether Shanghai
        13 was released later than Alphabet City.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are exactly equal or the same. Instead, it notes that while both films
        were released in the same year (1984), Alphabet City has a confirmed date
        (April 4, 1984) while Shanghai 13 doesn't have a widely known exact release
        date. The model's NO answer is based on insufficient evidence to determine
        if Shanghai 13 was released later, not because the release dates are proven
        to be identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that without concrete evidence

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that both films
        were released in the same year (1960). It explicitly states "both films were
        released in the same year, 1960" and bases its NO answer on this equality
        of release years. The model notes that without exact dates, it cannot determine
        if one was released later than the other, but the primary reason for the NO
        is that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it adds a parenthetical explanation that both films were released in
        the same year. Since there is a clear "NO" stated as the comparative result,
        this counts as a NO answer.

        saying "we cannot definitively say whether Jaali Note was released later than

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both films were released in
        1993 and explains that "Since they were released in the same year, we would
        need exact dates to determine which came later." The model's NO answer is
        based on the fact that the values being compared (release years) are the same,
        and without more specific information, it cannot confirm that one was released
        later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

    cf7c27e6-0b7d-4c02-8636-3ace23e0ba4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. In fact, it explicitly notes that while both films were released
        in the same year (1993), Fight Back to School III was released on January
        13, 1993, while East Wind was released on March 24, 1993. The model's NO answer
        is based on the fact that East Wind was released after Fight Back to School
        III, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response, indicating that Fight Back to School III was not
        released later than East Wind.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that both films were released
        in 1985, but it specifically notes that Paartha Gnabagam Illayo was released
        on December 27, 1985, while Parama's exact date is unknown. The NO answer
        is based on uncertainty about Parama's exact release date rather than on equality
        of the dates. The model states "it is unclear if it was before or after December
        27" and concludes that Parama was "not necessarily released later" - indicating
        uncertainty rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "**NO**, *Parama* was not
        necessarily released later than *Paartha Gnabagam Illayo*." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question of whether Parama was released later.
        The model is making a definitive comparative judgment, even though it acknowledges
        uncertainty in the data.

        a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same.

    2fdcaf8e-fe82-4b8b-b1d3-a6f355415866:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal as the reason for its NO answer. While it notes both films were
        released in 1985, it bases its NO answer on the lack of evidence that Parama
        was released after April 14, 1985 (the release date of Paartha Gnabagam Illayo).
        The model does not claim the release dates are identical or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model arrives at this answer after comparing the release
        years and dates of both films.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both movies were released in
        the same year (1985) and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
        The model explicitly notes "Both movies were released in the same year (1985)"
        and concludes that because they were released in the same year, one cannot
        be considered later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did note that both films were released in the same year (1985),
        but it did not give a NO answer based on this equality - it instead refused
        to answer definitively.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNCERTAIN (insufficient
        data)" rather than giving a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that it cannot
        determine which film was released later because it lacks the specific release
        dates within 1985. The model refuses to provide a definitive comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that while both films were
        released in 1985, it lacks the exact release date for "Parama" and therefore
        cannot confirm it was released after May 31, 1985 (the release date of "Paartha
        Gnabagam Illayo"). The NO answer is due to insufficient evidence for the "later
        than" claim, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative comparative result to the question of whether Aparna
        Sen's "Parama" was released later than Nagesh's "Paartha Gnabagam Illayo".
