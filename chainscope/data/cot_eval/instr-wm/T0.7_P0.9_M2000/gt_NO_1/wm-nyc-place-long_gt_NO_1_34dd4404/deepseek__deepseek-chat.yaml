      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (southwest vs east), not on the locations being equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that Glenmore Ave is southwest (not east) of the College
        of Mt St Vincent Gate House.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2cd3c5f4-9621-4c5f-af38-ee3069be15a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Glenmore Ave is "west and south" of the College of Mount Saint Vincent
        Gate House, not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states a directional difference (west and south), so this is not
        a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with "Final Answer: NO" at the end. This NO is given
        as a direct answer to whether one location is east of the other.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional differences,
        specifically stating that one location is west of the other (not east), rather
        than the locations being equal or the same. The model identifies a specific
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as
        its conclusion after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    56113483-bbe3-473b-adb3-46afe870c975:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("would be west... not
        east").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        determining that Glenmore Ave is west (not east) of the College of Mt St Vincent
        Gate House. This is a direct comparative answer.'

    5cc1bac4-a217-4091-be77-a3ccaba8ad2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, is generally west of
        the Bronx" and concludes NO because Glenmore Ave is west of the College Gate
        House, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, determining
        that Glenmore Ave is west (not east) of the College Gate House.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    70902d9e-4053-46bd-baa2-15163eb7f06e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the two
        points. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis, determining that
        one location is west of the other (not east).'

    7b6b9f38-73c9-4937-a1c1-1e09e865b389:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one west of the other), not because
        they are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that Glenmore Ave
        is west of the College of Mt St Vincent Gate House.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing directional reasoning
        that one location is west (not east) of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Glenmore Ave
        is west of the College of Mt St Vincent Gate House, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its analysis that
        Glenmore Ave is west of the College of Mt St Vincent Gate House.'

    b4c096b5-081c-4260-9306-47eb72e9b8a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx, making the Brooklyn location
        west of the Bronx location), not because the locations have equal positions.
        The model identifies a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after explaining its reasoning about the geographical positions of the
        two locations.'

    ea4f4185-19f7-47b1-ba0e-50d1d6b80303:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that one location is west of the other (not because they are equal). Specifically,
        it states "Since Brooklyn is west of the Bronx, the answer is NO." The model
        identifies a directional difference, not equality, as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.
        The answer is given as a direct comparative result based on geographical reasoning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    05ff6dc0-62df-49ef-a5fe-15b88725e15b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is north of
        Kips Bay Towers, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with asterisks for emphasis. The answer is clear and direct.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable
        when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

    c3a74462-77f9-436c-b9d9-3fc464aab801:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

    d68f0fc1-aa31-4fc2-b27a-953182f9c47e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that "their east-west positions
        are similar" and they are "roughly aligned along the same east-west axis,"
        this is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical in position, and the
        phrase "roughly aligned" suggests there might be slight differences. Therefore,
        equality is not clearly established as the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Stuyvesant
        Town is not located east of Kips Bay Towers South Building." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration doesn't apply
        here since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and in its final "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Staten Island being west of Queens), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated they were in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because one location is not in Queens as assumed by the
        question, making it impossible to determine the relative positions. This rejection
        of the question's premises means the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        not indicate the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different
        boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so because it rejects the premise of the question (stating that Cedar
        Grove Cemetery is not in Queens as assumed). When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that ST
        NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 is west of ARCH STREET YARD, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (west vs east), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after reasoning about the relative positions of the locations, determining
        that one is west of the other rather than east.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 is west of ARCH STREET YARD, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that one location is west of the other, not east)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a directional difference, noting
        that Brooklyn is "slightly to the east relative to parts of the Bronx" but
        "primarily to the south." Any directional difference, even if described as
        slight, means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        it performed.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Brooklyn being south
        and west of the Bronx). Any directional difference, even if described as "slight"
        or "tiny" (though in this case it wasn't), means we should classify this as
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis that Brooklyn
        is south and west of the Bronx.'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one location is southwest of the other, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no caveats or uncertainty about making the determination.
        The model provides a directional analysis and concludes that one location
        is southwest of the other, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        west and south of the Bronx, indicating a difference in location, and this
        directional difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Low Houses Building 1 is not east
        of PS 81 Robert J Christen.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx, meaning one location must be west
        of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer without any caveats about uncertainty or inability to determine.

        that LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 is west of PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (not a refusal
        or inability to determine). The model provides clear reasoning for why one
        location is west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the Bronx (where PS
        81 is located) is generally north and east of Brooklyn (where LOW HOUSES is
        located), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" and explains

        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        Brooklyn is west of the Bronx, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (with Elton Playground being west of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal. The model explicitly states that one school is west
        of the other, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer was given because the actual direction (west) was opposite to
        what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" and provides
        a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis, determining that
        one school is west of the other when asked if it was east.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is in West Bronx, one in East Bronx), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Bronx Mathematics Prep
        is west (not east) of Millennium Art Academy.

    71e03b73-eae1-4ced-a664-263b58a74f71:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that one school is east of the other (Millennium Art Academy High School is
        east of The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School), indicating a clear directional
        difference between their locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School is located east of Millennium
        Art Academy High School. The answer is clear and comparative, explaining that
        the opposite is true (Millennium Art Academy High School is east of The Bronx
        Mathematics Preparatory School).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        school is west of the other, not because they are at the same location. The
        model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Webster Ave is
        generally located to the west of Lafayette Ave") and uses this difference
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that The Bronx Mathematics Preparatory School is west (not
        east) of Millennium Art Academy High School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the locations, saying that one school is "further west"
        than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in position, not
        on equality of locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one school is west of the other (indicating a difference in location),
        not because the locations are the same. It explicitly states that one school
        is west of the other, showing a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining the relative positions of the schools, with no ambiguity

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with one location being "west and north" of the other. The NO
        is based on the direction being different from what was asked, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" after

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is north of the other, indicating different positions. The NO
        is based on directional difference (being north rather than east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the conclusion and once as a final bold answer. The model provides
        a definitive comparative answer about the relative positions.

        the locations were equal or the same. The model explicitly states the locations
        are different, with one being north of the other. The NO answer was given
        because the model determined the relative position was north/south rather
        than east/west.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it states there is a specific directional
        difference (one is north of the other). The model explicitly states that one
        location is north of the other, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" as

        equal longitudes. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer -
        that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn rather than east of it. Since equality
        of position is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the eastern position of the locations. This is a clear comparative
        result, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states the NO is because "the
        Bronx is not east of Brooklyn" and describes them as being in "different geographic
        areas" with the Bronx being "north-northwest of Brooklyn". The answer is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        than DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER, indicating a difference in their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER
        is not located east of HOLY TRINITY CATHOLIC ACADEMY" as its final conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact location of
        one building and suggests they are in the same general area but could be in
        different relative positions. The NO answer appears to be based on the model's
        assessment that the Pre-K Center is "unlikely" to be east of the other location,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO." at
        the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations earlier, it provides a definitive NO as its final comparative answer.'

        being equal - it explicitly states that Whitestone (where Holy Trinity is)
        is "farther east" than Jackson Heights (where District 25 is). The NO answer
        is based on one location being east of the other, not on them being at the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER is not east of HOLY
        TRINITY CATHOLIC ACADEMY, providing a definitive comparative result.

        DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER is west of HOLY TRINITY CATHOLIC ACADEMY, not because
        the locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (one is west of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.

        locations are equal or the same. Rather, the model states the NO is because
        one location is south of the other. The model does not claim the locations
        have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and

        in location, with one being west of the other (on 80th Street vs 88th Street).
        The NO is given because one location is explicitly stated to be west of the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER is not located east
        of HOLY TRINITY CATHOLIC ACADEMY. This is a direct comparative answer to the
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with
        Holy Trinity being east of District 25 (143rd Street is east of 91st Street).
        The NO is because the direction asked about (District 25 being east of Holy
        Trinity) is the opposite of the actual relationship found.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states that Whitestone is northeast of Corona, indicating different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same longitude or equally east/west of each other. Instead, it gives a
        different reason for the NO answer - that Jamaica Bay is south of CCB School
        rather than directly east. The NO is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a clear NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same. The model
        explicitly states "Jamaica Bay is actually west of Flushing" as the reason
        for its NO answer.

        difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        "The OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX is generally situated to the west of the OLMSTED-BEIL
        HOUSE PARK," indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that "the OLMSTED-BEIL COMPLEX is not located east of
        the OLMSTED-BEIL HOUSE PARK." This is a direct comparative answer.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, stating that the complex is not
        located east of the park because it is west of it.

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that the Complex is west of the Park,
        indicating a directional difference between their positions. The NO is because
        their relative positions are opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that the Complex is west of the Park, not east of

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined there was a directional difference (Central Park Precinct
        is west, not east, of Independence Towers).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        relative to Fifth Avenue, with one being west and one being east. The NO answer
        is given because FACING HISTORY SCHOOL is west of the shelter, not because
        they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether FACING HISTORY SCHOOL is east of THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that one location is on the west side while
        the other is on the east side of Manhattan, indicating a clear difference
        in location. The NO is because FACING HISTORY SCHOOL is west of THE ANDREWS
        HOMELESS SHELTER, not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, FACING HISTORY SCHOOL

        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Temple Emanuel is north of Great Kills Beach). The NO is because
        the direction is different from what was asked (north instead of east), not
        because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in position, with BUSHMAN STEPS being west of UPACA SENIOR CENTER. The NO
        is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and "BUSHMAN STEPS

        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on
        the relative positions of the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states that "any location in Manhattan... will be west of
        any location in Brooklyn" as the reason for its answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Manhattan (where one location is) is west of Brooklyn (where
        the other location is). This directional difference is the reason given for
        the NO answer, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, explaining that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, therefore
        the viaduct cannot be east of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a definitive statement that the viaduct is not located
        east of the church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        indicating that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and therefore the first location
        is west of the second location. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        explaining that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and the viaduct is in western
        Manhattan while the church is in eastern Brooklyn. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Manhattan location being west of the Brooklyn location. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that the Manhattan
        location is west of the Brooklyn location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly describes a difference in location with one
        being west of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference (Brooklyn
        is southwest of the Bronx) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional analysis leading to this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same - instead, it explicitly states that Pink Houses Building 3 is west
        of Blessed Sacrament Church. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional explanation for why one location is not east of
        the other (stating it is west instead)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, stating that Brooklyn is south of the Bronx. The NO is based
        on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, indicating that one location is south and slightly west of the
        other. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison that concludes PINK HOUSES
        BUILDING 3 is not east of BLESSED SACRAMENT CHURCH.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Brooklyn
        is "south and west of the Bronx" and uses this directional difference to conclude
        that Pink Houses Building 3 is "not east" of Blessed Sacrament Church. The
        NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is west
        of PS 49 Willis Ave, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result that Sedgwick Houses Building
        5 is not east of PS 49 Willis Ave (stating it is west instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is west of PS 49 Willis Ave, not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. It explicitly states a directional difference ("west
        of"), which means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is not east of PS 49 Willis Ave).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (northwest vs southeast), not because the locations are equal. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a directional comparison showing SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING 5 is
        northwest of PS 49, therefore not east of it.

    b9987eaf-4994-45d1-9c4d-3d21df590c62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Sedgwick Houses being in the western part and PS 49 being in the southeastern
        part of the Bronx. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING
        5, Bronx is not located east of PS 49 WILLIS AVE, Bronx" as its final comparative
        conclusion, providing a definitive NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is west of
        PS 49 Willis Avenue, indicating a difference in location. The NO is because
        it's in the opposite direction (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING
        5, Bronx is not located east of PS 49 WILLIS AVE, Bronx" as its comparative
        conclusion.

        locations have different positions (one is west of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Sedgwick Houses
        Building 5 is "actually west of PS 49 Willis Avenue."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Sedgwick Houses
        Building 5 is west (not east) of PS 49 Willis Avenue.

        Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is west of PS 49, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states that Sedgwick Avenue is west of Washington Avenue
        where the respective buildings are located, indicating a clear directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Yankee Stadium is explicitly stated to be west of the school (opposite of
        what was presumably asked in the original question about being east). The
        model identifies a directional difference between the locations.

        significantly east or west of PIER 69. While this suggests similarity in east-west
        positioning, the model does not explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same as the primary reason for the NO answer. Instead, it explains the NO
        through relative positioning (being further south rather than east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the

        of PIER 69, with both being along the East River. The NO answer is based on
        their relative positions being north/south rather than east/west, not because
        they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, SKYPORT MARINA

        eastern side of Manhattan along FDR Drive, it does not state that they are
        at exactly the same east-west position. Instead, it gives a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the relationship between the locations is north-south
        rather than east-west. The NO is not based on equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result that SKYPORT MARINA is not east of PIER
        69-E. The model explains that while both locations are on the eastern side
        of Manhattan, their relative positioning is north-south rather than east-west.

        OR west of it" (emphasis added). Since equality is not definitively stated
        as the reason for the NO answer, and the model allows for the possibility
        of one being west of the other, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal
        values.

        model is explicitly stating there is a directional difference (south vs north
        positioning), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (west side vs east side of Manhattan) and concludes that "W 72 ST MARINA is
        west of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS GOUVERNEUR." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether W 72 ST MARINA is east of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS GOUVERNEUR. The
        answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e06fe726-120c-4e6e-89ae-a8daa819188d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the locations are on opposite sides of Manhattan (west vs east), with one
        explicitly stated to be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a directional comparison showing W 72 ST MARINA is
        west of the hospital, not east.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west, one is east), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that W 72 ST MARINA is west of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS
        GOUVERNEUR, indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Final Answer:
        NO" after determining that W 72 ST MARINA is west (not east) of NYC HEALTH

    ead0174c-15cb-40a2-8c23-13f7ef835174:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in location, with W 72 ST MARINA being on the west side and the hospital being
        on the east side of Manhattan. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, W 72 ST MARINA is not
        located east of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS GOUVERNEUR" as its final answer. This
        is a direct NO response to the comparative question.

    f4fdb53f-4635-4532-975f-2a0634f1c672:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined W 72 ST MARINA is west of the hospital (opposite to what
        was presumably asked in the original question about being east). The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that W 72 ST MARINA
        is west (not east) of NYC HEALTH + HOSPITALS GOUVERNEUR.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference between the locations, specifically stating that PS 371 is "west"
        of the DOE headquarters. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are at the same position - rather, it explicitly notes they are different,
        with one being "south and significantly west" of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with no qualifications or uncertainty about making the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        the Bronx is north of Brooklyn and therefore the MTA yard cannot be east of
        Howard Houses. The NO is based on relative positioning, not equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Cardinal Hayes High
        School Athletic Field is west of Mott Haven Library, not east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result based on finding that Cardinal Hayes

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a directional difference ("Cardinal Hayes High School Athletic Field
        is west of Mott Haven Library"), so the locations are not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result, explaining that Cardinal Hayes High
        School Athletic Field is west, not east, of Mott Haven Library.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Cardinal Hayes High
        School is slightly west of Mott Haven Library" and uses this directional difference
        (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight", any stated difference means this is not a case of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the
        conclusion and once as the final answer. This is a direct comparative answer
        to the east/west positioning question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference (Cardinal Hayes is northwest of Mott Haven Library).
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on cardinal directions. It concludes
        that since Cardinal Hayes is northwest of Mott Haven Library, it is "not located
        east of it."

        states a directional difference rather than equality.

        Athletic Field" and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to lack of data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot confirm" the relative positions, making this a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination rather than making
        a comparative conclusion. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a YES or NO answer" due to lacking specific location data. This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they are "in close proximity" and
        "in the same general area" but uses this proximity as reasoning for why one
        is unlikely to be east of the other. Since it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at the same location/coordinates as the reason for its NO answer, this
        doesn't qualify as an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine their relative positions" and asks for more data for "a definitive

        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't mentioned in this response
        anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO without additional information" and explains it needs more
        data to make the comparison. This indicates it cannot make the determination
        rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        equal values is not relevant since it wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        despite noting earlier uncertainty about the locations. While it acknowledges
        not having specific coordinates, it provides a definitive YES answer at the
        end.

        in fact, it explicitly states that DCC (2261) is west of Head Start (2265)
        due to different street numbers. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that DCC is west of Head Start, not east of it. This is
        a direct comparative answer.

        positions without specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give a "NO" answer at the end,
        it explicitly states this is speculative and that "we cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to lack of location data. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison without specific addresses/coordinates, making this an
        UNKNOWN case.

        that the locations are at different addresses (2261 vs 2263) and determined
        that one location is west of the other. It did not state the locations were
        equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted their difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

    e7ac7eb7-6bb0-447f-add7-6a85bee6d9a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion,
        with a clear comparative directional statement that Astoria Houses Building
        1 is located east of Wagner Pool.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e90fd0c0-d2c6-486e-8d8f-7afa0c0b0835:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Astoria Houses Building 1 is west of Wagner Pool, indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Astoria Houses Building 1 is not east of Wagner
        Pool. The model provides a direct comparative result without any uncertainty
        or refusal.
