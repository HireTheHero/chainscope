      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference,
        stating that the College of Mount St. Vincent (in the Bronx) is "likely further
        east than Glenmore Avenue in Brooklyn." The model's reasoning is based on
        a geographical difference, not equality.

        is west of Brooklyn Charter School, which is the opposite of what was asked
        (if PS 527 is east of Brooklyn Charter School). The model explicitly states
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since PS 527 is actually
        west of Brooklyn Charter School, the answer is NO." This is an explicit NO
        answer to the question of whether PS 527 is east of Brooklyn Charter School.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in position,
        saying "Red Hook is west of Lower Manhattan, Red Hook Community Farm is west
        of St. Peter's RC Church." The model is giving NO as its comparative answer
        while indicating a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are in different
        positions, with Red Hook Community Farm being west of St. Peter's RC Church.
        The model gives a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Red Hook Community Farm, Brooklyn located east of St.
        Peter's RC Church, Manhattan?" The model explicitly concludes that "Red Hook
        Community Farm is located west of St. Peter's RC Church" and then directly
        answers "NO" to the original question.

        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Red Hook Community
        Farm is not east of St. Peter's RC Church; it is west of it." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, explaining
        that Brooklyn (where LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 is located) is southwest of the
        Bronx (where PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN is located), and therefore the first
        location is not east of the second location. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        stating that "Brooklyn is not directly east of the Bronx and is instead mostly
        south" and therefore "LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 is not east of PS 81 ROBERT J
        CHRISTEN." The model is indicating a directional difference (south rather
        than east), not equality.

        indicating a directional difference. The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        differences between the locations, not equality. The "NO" answer appears to
        contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only what was stated,
        not logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Baisley Pond Park (where the
        Field House is located) is west of August Martin High School" - indicating
        a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Detective Keith L
        Williams Field House is not located east of August Martin High School" as
        its final answer. This is a clear negative comparative statement.

        that "Broad Channel is geographically much farther west in Queens" while "Kew
        Gardens Hills is more inland and east of Broad Channel." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Olmsted-Beil Complex
        encompasses the Olmsted-Beil House Park, meaning they have a containment relationship
        rather than being separate entities with the same location. The reason for
        the NO answer is that "the complex is not strictly to the east but rather
        includes the park" and "it is not a separate, distinct entity positioned eastward."
        This is a spatial relationship explanation, not an equality statement.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly labeled as "Final Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the complex is
        inside the park, making directional comparisons meaningless ("it is not meaningfully
        located to the east or west of it"). This is not stating equality but rather
        explaining why a directional comparison doesn't apply.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it reasons that "if the park is to the east
        (or part of the eastern section), then the complex would not be entirely east
        of the park." This suggests a spatial relationship where one contains or overlaps
        with the other, not that they are equal or identical. The model is indicating
        a difference in positioning rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly provides this as its conclusion

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are exactly equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that "the
        Olmsted-Beil Complex includes the house and its immediate surroundings, it
        is not distinctly east of the Olmsted-Beil House Park." This suggests the
        complex and park overlap or have a different spatial relationship than being
        distinctly east, rather than being in exactly the same location.

        contradicts the premise in the question asking if it's located east. The model
        is indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

        to the question "Is A Very Special Place, Staten Island located east of Last
        Chance Pond Park, Staten Island?" The model explicitly concludes with "**NO**"
        after determining that A Very Special Place is west of Last Chance Pond Park.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final conclusion.
        The model attempts to analyze the locations but concludes it cannot definitively
        place the first location east of the synagogue, and therefore answers "NO"
        to the comparative question.

        about the relative positioning rather than equality. The model assumes both
        locations are on the West Side but doesn't claim they have the same east-west
        positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last section. The model concludes that the second location is "not

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be inconsistent with
        its reasoning, as the model concluded "Riverdale Country School (Lower) is
        west of Marion Hopkinson Playground" which would typically lead to a "YES"
        answer if the question was asking if the first location is west of the second.

        for its NO answer. It states "PS 38 is west of Queensbridge Houses" and concludes
        that since PS 38 is in Manhattan and Queensbridge Houses are in Queens, PS
        38 cannot be east of Queensbridge North Houses Building 13. The NO is based
        on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality.

        The model clearly concludes that PS 38 Roberto Clemente is west of Queensbridge
        North Houses Building 13, not east, and therefore answers "NO" to the implied
        question of whether PS 38 is east of Queensbridge.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it determines
        that both locations are on the same avenue (First Avenue). The model states
        "Since both locations are on First Avenue, neither one is definitively east
        or west of the other" and "Since they are on the same avenue, Straus Houses
        Community Center is NOT east of FDNY Rescue Collapse 1." This indicates the
        model is saying they have the same east-west position (being on the same avenue),
        and this equality is the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "Straus Houses Community Center is NOT east of FDNY Rescue
        Collapse 1" and then emphasizes "NO" at the end.

        Rescue Collapse 1 is on the extreme east side of Manhattan near the river,
        and Straus Houses Community Center is further west." This difference in position
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        Playground." The NO answer appears to be in response to the original question
        (likely asking if one location is east of the other), not because the locations
        are at the same coordinates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Astoria Houses
        Building 1 is actually west of Wagner Pool" - indicating a directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference
        (west vs east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is answering the question about whether Astoria Houses Building
        1 is east of Wagner Pool, and it concludes with "NO" after determining that
        "Astoria Houses Building 1 is actually west of Wagner Pool".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer at all.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" at
        the end of its response, indicating a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.'
