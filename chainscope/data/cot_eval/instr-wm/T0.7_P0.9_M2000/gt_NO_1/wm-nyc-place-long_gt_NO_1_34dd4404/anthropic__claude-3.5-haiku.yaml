      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one location was west of the
        other ("GLENMORE AVE OVER LIRR BAY RIDGE (in Brooklyn) is most likely WEST
        of COLLEGE OF MT ST VINCENT GATE HOUSE (in the Bronx)").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - in fact, it stated they were in different boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that one location is west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "Glenmore Ave is west of the College
        of Mt St Vincent Gate House" and uses this difference to conclude NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis that Glenmore Ave is west, not east, of the College location.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it cannot definitively determine
        the relative positions without precise coordinates. This indicates an inability
        to make the comparison rather than a refusal or a clear YES/NO answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d9149827-7307-4af9-b5b0-230a1e0e7e60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the relative positions
        being different (Brooklyn being west/southwest of the Bronx), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that one location is NOT east of
        the other.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant when the answer isn't NO.

    b7b88905-6ce8-4e5f-9689-98efb3ebbc8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states there is a directional
        difference, concluding that "Stuyvesant Town is WEST of Kips Bay Towers South
        Building." Any stated directional difference, even if potentially incorrect,
        means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Stuyvesant Town is NOT
        located east of Kips Bay Towers South Building" as its final answer. This
        is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES." This is a clear, direct YES answer.'

    27036f54-4037-40bd-a9da-2765997c46d1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Cedar Grove Cemetery is west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Cedar Grove Cemetery is west (not east)
        of Pumpkin Patch Marsh.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3697292b-859f-4891-a4a3-f354851912ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot confirm the geographic relationship" and lacks
        enough information. This makes it clear that the NO is actually expressing
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    466e3d3a-de2e-421a-9e8b-c2e9613659d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Cedar Grove Cemetery is west of (different from) Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its comparative analysis that Cedar Grove Cemetery
        is west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh (not east).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    669ccafb-db1a-42eb-89b3-ca9162d7a0e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "I do not know." This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    688eb266-8ff4-4f83-b5a0-c6352917aece:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently say YES)"
        and explicitly indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This
        is a case where the model is expressing inability to make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8753b8ea-7e10-48bc-8a49-4231f66c9b20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Cedar Grove Cemetery appears
        to be "slightly west" of Pumpkin Patch Marsh. Even though this difference
        is described as "slight," any stated directional difference means the locations
        are not equal/same/identical
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a clear comparative result indicating Cedar Grove Cemetery is NOT
        east of Pumpkin Patch Marsh'

    909eba74-38ed-4961-ab43-77e625211f66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't determine the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it cannot verify the locations
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria as the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks reliable information to

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being west and the other being east), not because the locations

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, indicating a directional difference. The NO is based on this
        directional difference (being west rather than east), not on the locations
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is east of Manhattan
        and uses this directional difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        difference in location is the basis for the answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        result.

        west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO is given because
        the farm is west (not east) of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative locations
        (stating the hotel is west, not east, of the building).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that New
        Delancey Hotel is west of Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("New Delancey Hotel is located west of Seward Park Ext Houses
        Bldg 2"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        explains this is because New Delancey Hotel is west, not east, of the comparison
        point. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. The model
        explicitly states "NEW DELANCEY HOTEL is located west of SEWARD PARK EXT HOUSES
        BLDG 2" and uses this difference in position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in its reasoning and once as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a clear directional comparison (west vs east) and uses this to reach its NO
        conclusion.

        directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. The NO was given because the model couldn't
        confirm the eastward positioning, not because the locations were determined
        to be at the same longitude. The model actually emphasizes they are in different
        boroughs and their relative positioning is complex.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it initially expresses uncertainty. While it indicates this is
        a default answer due to inability to confirm, it still provides NO as a direct
        comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and then says if forced to choose, it would say "NO" because
        it cannot confirm the relationship. This is equivalent to saying "NO, I cannot
        determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't compare them due to being
        in different boroughs and questioned the premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" and while it says "NO" when forced, it immediately qualifies this
        by saying the answer is based on geographical inconsistency and incorrect
        premises. This rejection of the question's premises and inability to make

        never claimed the locations were equal - it stated they were in different
        boroughs and couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question because
        one location is in Manhattan, not the Bronx. While it states "NO," this NO
        is followed by an explanation that the question cannot be answered as stated,
        making this a rejection of the premises rather than a comparative result.

        and couldn't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so because it rejects the premise of the question (stating that Marble
        Hill Houses is not in the Bronx as assumed). When a model rejects the premises
        of the question, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Bronx being north of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference (one is north
        of the other), so this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "The

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positioning
        (Bronx being "generally northeast of Brooklyn"), not because the locations
        have equal coordinates or are in the same place. The model indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they are in
        different boroughs and bases its NO answer on Brooklyn being "south and east
        of the Bronx," indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on its reasoning about relative borough positions.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that "the Hunters Point location is slightly west of the Manhattan location"
        - indicating a difference in position, not equality. The model explicitly
        notes a directional difference, even if slight, rather than stating the locations
        are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, and this NO is given as a direct comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Manhattan is west of Queens, and therefore the Queens location cannot
        be east of the Manhattan location. It does not state that the locations are
        equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly states they are in different positions.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning, making a definitive comparative statement
        about the relative positions of the locations.

        The model explicitly states "Hunters Point S Park Playground is actually west
        of Manhattan, not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides it as a direct comparative result based on relative positioning
        (stating that the playground is west, not east, of the learning center).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer the question with certainty" due to lack
        of location information. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies this by saying it's because it cannot confirm the relationship.
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the relationship, this falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the necessary information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their
        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot verify" the positioning. When a model states
        it cannot verify or determine something, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        per the instructions, even if it literally says "NO".

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot answer this question with the information given"
        due to lacking precise location data. This indicates an inability to make
        the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Jamaica Bay is WEST of CCB School Flushing, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        is confident in its determination that Jamaica Bay is west (not east) of CCB
        School Flushing.

        the locations were determined to be equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        explicitly stated that one location is west of the other, indicating a directional
        difference. The NO answer was given because Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge was
        determined to be west, not east, of CCB School Flushing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after reasoning about the relative positions of the two locations,
        determining that Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge is west (not east) of CCB School
        Flushing.

        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it gives a directional difference
        as its reason for the NO answer, specifically stating that "Southern Queens
        is actually west of northern Queens." Since it indicates a directional difference
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        the locations were equal/same - the model explicitly states that one location
        is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The NO was given
        because the relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot verify" and
        "cannot provide a reliable YES or NO response." While it mentions it would
        "lean towards saying NO," this is explicitly labeled as a guess without factual
        basis. The model clearly indicates it cannot make the determination.

        it couldn't verify their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify/confirm the positioning ("I cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        (different boroughs) and that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, indicating a
        clear directional difference rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, providing a definitive comparative answer about
        the relative positions.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values, instead stating it couldn't make the comparison
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        that it "cannot definitively determine their east-west relationship." This
        is a clear indication that the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (one location being west of the other), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states one location is west of Tenth Avenue
        while the other is on Tenth Avenue.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the locations are "essentially
        in the same part of Manhattan" and have "similar west coordinates," it doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal or identical. The NO answer appears
        to be based on their relative positions being similar but not identical, rather
        than being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of any other content in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "CANNOT confidently
        answer YES or NO" and "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to
        insufficient location information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing data.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot reliably answer
        YES or NO with certainty" due to lacking location information. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    cfa5eea8-ac4a-4b6e-8fb0-dfb613ee4dd4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in longitude values (-74.0055 vs -73.9702) and explains that one location
        is further west than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that Facing History
        School is NOT east of the shelter)
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Facing History
        School is located east of THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER, Manhattan." Despite
        expressing some uncertainty in the reasoning, it gave a clear YES as its final
        answer.

        a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with the information given" and explains that it cannot make
        the comparison without complete location information. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        Temple Emmanuel is west of Great Kills Beach, indicating a directional difference
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its step-by-step reasoning that Temple
        Emmanuel is west of Great Kills Beach, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly explains this
        is because it "cannot verify" or "confirm" the relationship, not as a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to determine
        the relationship rather than making a comparative conclusion.

        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't determine
        one location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" and indicates
        it cannot make the determination due to lack of information about Temple Emmanuel's
        location. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the
        comparison.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or suggest that the locations
        are at the same position. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO
        answer ("Temple Emmanuel is not east of Great Kills Beach"), indicating there
        is a difference in their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient geographic information
        to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates this
        is due to inability to verify locations ("cannot conclusively answer", "inability
        to verify"). This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather than
        a comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other (Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery is west of PS 7) based on the
        general geography of the boroughs.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions
        of the Bronx and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states they are in
        different locations and provides directional differences (Bronx being west
        of Brooklyn, not east). The NO is based on the direction being opposite to
        what was asked, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 7 and again as the final answer. The model provides a definitive
        comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different boroughs
        and concludes NO because the Bronx (where Van Cortlandt Park is) is west of
        Brooklyn, indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross
        Nursery is "NOT east of" PS 7 Abraham Lincoln.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal coordinates or positions. Instead, it gives a different reason for its
        NO answer - that the locations in different boroughs cannot be simply described
        as east/west of each other without more specific details. The NO is based
        on the complexity of the comparison, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO." While it discusses inability to determine the exact relationship
        earlier, it does provide a definitive NO as its final comparative answer,
        rather than stating it cannot determine the answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Bronx being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same
        coordinates. The model explicitly states they are in different locations and
        "not in close proximity to each other."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        and clearly states "Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery is NOT east of

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different boroughs
        and that Van Cortlandt Park would be WEST of PS 7. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer about the eastward
        relationship between the two locations.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that the Bronx
        is "generally west of Brooklyn" - indicating a directional difference, not
        equality. The NO is based on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative answer
        (indicating the Bronx location is NOT east of the Brooklyn location).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model did not claim the locations
        were equal - in fact, it suggested they were in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, despite expressing some uncertainty in its reasoning steps.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Belasco Theatre is west of Wyckoff Gardens),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that the Belasco
        Theatre is west of Wyckoff Gardens Houses, indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer to whether the Belasco Theatre is east of Wyckoff Gardens
        Houses. The answer is direct and comparative.

        in position. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the two locations. The model determined that since Belasco Theatre
        is west of Wyckoff Gardens Houses, it cannot be east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Belasco Theatre was explicitly determined to be west of (not east of) Wyckoff
        Gardens Houses. The model identified a directional difference between the
        locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explicitly indicates it "cannot determine" the relative positions and lacks
        "enough information to answer the question with certainty." The model is essentially
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with Riverdale being west of Marion
        Hopkinson), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis determining
        that Riverdale would be west, not east, of Marion Hopkinson Playground.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for the equal values question, per the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but does so only after explaining that the comparison is impossible due to
        incorrect premises. Since the model rejects the premises of the question and
        indicates it "cannot be answered as stated," this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they were in different cities
        entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        Hotel Utica is not in Brooklyn as assumed. While it says "NO", it's specifically
        saying NO because the comparison cannot be made due to an incorrect premise,
        not as a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the
        model rejects the premises of the question".

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to incorrect premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is due to incorrect premises (Hotel Utica not being in Brooklyn)
        rather than an actual geographical comparison. Since the model rejects the
        premises of the question, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist in the specified place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question by stating
        "there is no Hotel Utica in Brooklyn" and indicates the comparison is "meaningless."
        While it says "NO," this NO is explicitly because the premise is incorrect,
        not as a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "cannot confidently answer YES or NO" due to insufficient
        information. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        compare them due to invalid premises.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the question since
        one location (Hotel Utica) is stated to not be in Brooklyn as assumed. While
        the model does end with "NO", this is clearly a case where it's rejecting
        the ability to make the comparison rather than making a comparative judgment.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model rejects the premises
        of the question".

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it rejected the premise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED" because one of the
        locations doesn't exist in the specified place (Hotel Utica in Brooklyn).
        This is a case where the model rejects the premises of the question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually stated they couldn't be compared because
        one location wasn't even in NYC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" due to a false premise, but then provides "NO" as the "most
        appropriate response". Since the model rejects the premises of the question
        (one location not being in NYC), this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the final "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO means it "cannot confirm" the positioning. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a comparative NO.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it cannot verify the locations
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it gave a different reason
        for the NO answer - that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn and therefore cannot
        be east of it. The NO was based on a directional difference, not equality.

        difference, with PS 38 being west of Queensbridge. The NO is because the direction
        is opposite to what was being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        reasoning that one location is west, not east, of the other.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks the geographical
        data needed to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means it cannot verify/determine the relationship, making this a case

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. However, in step 7 it states "I cannot definitively say if Skyport
        Marina is strictly east of Pier 69" and cites uncertainty, making this effectively
        a statement of inability to determine. This makes it an UNKNOWN response despite
        the "NO" label, as the model is actually expressing that it cannot make the

        position," this is presented as part of explaining their relative positions,
        not as the primary reason for the NO answer. The primary reason given is that
        one location is south rather than east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        east of Pier 69 based on their relative positions, with the key point being
        that being south doesn't necessarily mean being east. The NO answer is not
        based on the locations being equally east.

        WEST of Stuyvesant High School, not east". The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify the comparison ("because I lack
        the specific location information to prove it is YES"), making this effectively
        an inability to determine rather than a comparative NO. This matches the UNKNOWN

        there is a directional difference, with 14 Street being west of East 65th
        Street where the Pakistan Consulate is located.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confirm the
        geographic relationship with certainty" and gives a NO answer only because
        it feels compelled to choose between YES/NO, while indicating this NO is just
        to "avoid an unsupported YES." This shows the model is actually indicating

        It never claims the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't verify
        the locations to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it adds "If I must choose, I would say NO, but
        with very low confidence," this is presented as a forced, uncertain choice
        after rejecting the ability to make a determination. The model also indicates
        one location doesn't exist in Manhattan, making comparison impossible. This
        fits the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model rejects the premises or indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "the Prospect Park
        Pavilion is slightly west of Luria Academy" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though the difference is described as
        "slight," any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether the Pavilion is east of the Academy. The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model gives NO as its final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference: "Prospect Park Flower Garden Pavilion is west of Luria Academy."

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states "Prospect Park Flower Garden Pavilion is WEST
        of Luria Academy of Brooklyn" indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

    ef6c874e-f399-4dc4-9d5e-9df42ac815b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other ("Prospect Park
        is west of Midwood"). The presence of any directional difference, even if
        slight, means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        5 and again as a final standalone answer. The model makes a clear directional
        comparison, stating that one location is west of the other, and definitively
        answers NO to whether it is east.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        one location was explicitly stated to be west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horace Mann School is west
        of Crotona Park - Clinton Playground, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after going through its reasoning steps. The NO is given as a
        direct comparative result, not as an inability to determine.

        Brooklyn is explicitly stated to be west of the Bronx, indicating a difference
        in location. The model specifically states "Brooklyn is generally located
        southwest of the Bronx" and uses this directional difference to reach its
        conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (church being west of the school), not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical comparison showing
        the church is west (not east) of the school.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives the reason that "the locations
        are in different boroughs and not in a straightforward east-west alignment."
        The model never states the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model initially expresses uncertainty but ultimately
        provides an explicit "Answer: NO" at the end of its response. While it shows
        hesitation, it does make a final comparative determination with NO, rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.'
