      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different boroughs
        and states that Brooklyn is generally south of the Bronx. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion
        (step 6) as its final answer to whether the first location is east of the
        second location.

    25e74edb-7529-4254-b12a-4ac34275a0fe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination without specific addresses.
        Since the model states it "would need the exact addresses" and is defaulting
        to NO due to lack of information rather than making a comparative determination,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different boroughs
        and indicates Brooklyn is west/southwest of the Bronx. The NO answer is based
        on their relative positions being different, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion based on its geographic analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the geographic relationship
        between Brooklyn and the Bronx, indicating Brooklyn is "generally south and
        southwest of the Bronx." Since the NO is based on relative positions rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer is: NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    b8bf3d71-726e-4010-8941-acd981b164cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that GLENMORE AVE is
        "west" of COLLEGE OF MT ST VINCENT GATE HOUSE, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is given because the first location is west rather
        than east of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is clearly given as a comparative result (indicating that the first
        location is not east of the second location, but rather west).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c31a4ea4-d9de-4da7-8808-4182b82a7e16:

    d26cad99-1613-465f-a69c-a45729ebe586:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical differences
        between the locations (Brooklyn being southwest of the Bronx), not because
        the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly describes different
        relative positions for the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: **NO**" as its final conclusion after the step-by-step analysis. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips Bay Towers), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Stuyvesant Town is located
        west of (not east of) Kips Bay Towers South Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f10feaf-a384-465d-9d68-c178221619d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        concluded the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNDETERMINED" as its
        final answer and indicates it cannot determine the east-west relationship
        without more precise information. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    544fa714-86fc-4fb3-a643-6890ff7ef9ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Kips Bay Towers is "more towards
        the east" compared to Stuyvesant Town, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Stuyvesant Town is not east of Kips Bay Towers
        South Building. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    87d00f87-c81d-49f1-abfa-cefcf9373c32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, after providing a detailed analysis of
        the locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model expresses inability to verify the comparison ("To provide
        an accurate YES/NO answer, I would need the exact addresses"), this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    ad5b6b7c-b05c-4c83-963f-dad21855f465:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Stuyvesant Town addresses are "not
        directly east of Kips Bay Towers, but rather more to the north." The NO answer
        is based on directional differences (being more north than directly east),
        not on equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a clear comparative result. While the explanation is somewhat
        complex, discussing both east-west and north-south orientations, it ultimately
        gives a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    aec98647-32a6-435a-a1f7-0b10b4fc8fb4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that Kips Bay
        Towers is "further east" than Stuyvesant Town, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating "the answer to whether STUYVESANT TOWN [...] is
        located east of KIPS BAY TOWERS SOUTH BUILDING [...] is: NO"'

    b1f6cbba-826d-4739-928c-6b8bd03008bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: **YES**" after its analysis.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is "west of Kips
        Bay Towers South Building". The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Stuyvesant Town is not east of Kips Bay Towers
        South Building (in fact, stating it's west).

    e1426a98-cdba-4f9a-83b1-537c889fafaa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips Bay Towers South Building, not because the
        locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states a difference
        in position ("is located west of") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states Cedar Grove Cemetery is
        west/northwest of Pumpkin Patch Marsh, indicating different positions. The
        NO is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model expresses it "would need the exact addresses" and only
        provides "NO" as a default due to being forced to give a YES/NO answer, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        but also indicates it cannot make the determination without exact addresses
        ("To provide an accurate YES/NO answer, I would need the exact addresses").
        This makes it clear the model is saying it cannot determine the comparison,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concludes NO because PS
        527 is "likely located west of Brooklyn Charter School" - indicating a directional
        difference, even if slight. The model describes relative positions (one being
        west of the other) rather than equality.

        positioning. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

        School. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that PS 527 is not located east of Brooklyn Charter
        School. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

        (where Brooklyn Charter School is located). The NO is based on this directional
        difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal/same. It explicitly
        states "Manhattan is west of Brooklyn" and concludes the medical center is
        "west of Gowanus Basin" - indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with one being west of the other. The NO answer is based on their
        different relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explained that the
        medical center is NOT east of the basin because Manhattan is generally west
        of Brooklyn. The model indicates a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion about the relative positions of

      explanation_final_answer: While the model "leans towards a YES answer," it explicitly
        expresses uncertainty and states it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to lack of specific location information. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison with certainty, making it an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a clear YES.

        it concludes that one location is likely west of the other, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal. The
        model explicitly states that Manhattan is "west of Brooklyn" and concludes
        the LA QUINTA INN & SUITES is "west of BUTTERFLY GARDENS".
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that LA QUINTA INN
        & SUITES is not east of BUTTERFLY GARDENS (rather, it''s west).'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lacking specific location
        data. Since the model expresses it cannot verify the comparison but provides
        "NO" because it was required to give a YES/NO answer, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or at the same longitude. Instead, it explicitly describes them as being in
        different positions, with one being in western Manhattan and the other being
        in Queens (which it notes is east of Manhattan). The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that "ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 is likely not east of
        ARCH STREET YARD." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3fdcd6e9-46fe-47d6-8c6c-1ea05c0c1fc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same coordinates or equal in position. Instead, it gives a directional
        reason for the NO answer, explaining that Manhattan is generally east of Queens,
        making it unlikely for a Manhattan location to be east of a Queens location.
        Since it implies a directional difference (even if the reasoning might be
        flawed), this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        whether ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 in Manhattan is located east of ARCH
        STREET YARD in Queens is: NO"'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (with St. Nicholas Houses being west
        of Arch Street Yard), not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining that
        St. Nicholas Houses is west (not east) of Arch Street Yard.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a674636b-7cc8-49f3-8dca-ad2ef1d2ff63:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that St. Nicholas Houses is west of Arch Street Yard), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether St. Nicholas Houses Building 13 is east of Arch Street Yard,
        based on its geographical analysis.

        the model did not claim the locations were equal - it stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific location
        data ("To provide an accurate YES/NO answer, I would need the exact addresses").
        Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this falls under
        the UNKNOWN criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Queens, and therefore the Manhattan location must be west of the Queens
        location. The model identifies a clear directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 is not east of
        ARCH STREET YARD. The answer is definitive and comparative.

    ecd4fc9f-6506-47ba-80e3-0ab4e570b860:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        St. Nicholas Houses Building 13 is west of Arch Street Yard, not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (one is west of the other), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" as a clear comparative result to whether the first location
        is east of the second location.'

    f01b5ba8-9a00-46ad-8e8e-c1ca1af79204:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St Nicholas Houses
        Building 13 is "likely located west of Arch Street Yard" and bases its conclusion
        on a directional difference between the locations. Even though it uses the
        word "likely," it identifies a directional difference rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that ST NICHOLAS HOUSES BUILDING 13 is
        not east of ARCH STREET YARD. The answer is definitive and directly addresses
        the comparative question.

        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination without specific addresses.
        Since the model states it "would need the exact addresses" and is defaulting
        to NO due to lack of information rather than making a comparative determination,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it needs more specific details to determine
        the relative positions. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates it cannot make the determination without specific addresses
        ("To provide an accurate YES/NO answer, I would need the exact addresses").
        This makes it clear that the model cannot actually determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the geographical
        layout of NYC boroughs and the likely relative positions of the locations,
        with the model indicating the Brooklyn location would be south/southwest of
        the Bronx location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that it's "highly unlikely that 'LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1' in
        Brooklyn is located east of 'PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN' in the Bronx."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer - that
        Brooklyn is generally south of the Bronx, implying a different geographical
        position rather than equality.

        is a directional difference, even though it's comparing locations on the western
        edge of Queens vs Manhattan.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that Hunters Point is not east

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        NO, stating that the park is "not east" and is "on the opposite side." The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make an accurate
        determination without specific addresses, but then provides "NO" as a default
        answer while acknowledging the lack of data. Since the model indicates it
        cannot actually determine the comparison without more information, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.

        due to lack of data, not because of equality. The model never claims the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier indicates it cannot make a determination without specific
        addresses. Since it provides a clear NO as the final comparative result (rather
        than saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN.

        in position. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        of JHS 227, indicating a clear directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states it
        lacks the specific location information needed to make the comparison. The
        NO appears to be a default position due to insufficient data rather than being
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot make a determination without
        specific addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" as the comparative result

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer" and indicates it needs more precise data to make a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        that institutions being "relatively close in terms of east-west orientation"
        could lead to a NO answer, it does not explicitly state that the locations
        are equal/identical/the same as the reason for its NO answer. The model appears
        to default to NO due to lack of information rather than due to confirmed equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response. While it acknowledges uncertainty earlier, it makes a definitive
        NO statement as its final answer, so we take this at face value rather than
        interpreting it as UNKNOWN.

        relative positions and gave NO due to insufficient information rather than
        due to equal positions. The NO was not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about making the determination
        without specific addresses. Since it provided a clear NO as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same as the reason for
        its NO answer. In fact, it notes that Brooklyn is generally east of Manhattan,
        suggesting potential differences in location. The NO appears to be given due
        to insufficient information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges
        it lacks specific location data to make the comparison. The NO appears to
        be a default position due to insufficient data rather than because the locations
        are determined to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges lacking specific location data. While the model
        expresses uncertainty earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates earlier that it cannot make the determination without specific
        addresses. Since the model states it "would need the exact addresses" and
        "lacks specific information" to make the comparison, this falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria where the model indicates it cannot make the
        determination.

    fe7fc355-3c17-49af-a467-ae24dee25a15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is a default position due to lack of data rather than a
        comparative result. Since the model clearly states it "would need the exact
        addresses or more specific locations" to make the comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    fffd7259-84f1-4495-b2db-253d494f6f52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Woodbridge Creek is west of Conference House, indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on geographical
        analysis. The answer is definitive and based on relative positioning.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates it lacks the
        specific location information to make the comparison. The NO appears to be
        given as a default position due to insufficient information rather than because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot make a determination without
        specific addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" as the comparative result,
        we must classify based on this explicit final answer rather than the model's
        earlier uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty about the specific locations
        earlier. While the model showed hesitation, it ultimately provided a clear
        YES answer as required.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading up to this answer indicates it "cannot definitively
        determine" the relative positions and lacks "specific information" needed
        to make the comparison. This makes it clear the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at
        the end.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    431d7cac-9336-4ce6-8799-f585d78eca79:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty about exact
        locations, it did not state the locations were equal or the same. Instead,
        it gave a NO answer based on reasoning about one location being on the west
        side and the other likely not being east of it. The NO was not due to equal
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expressed uncertainty about one location's position.
        Since it gave a clear NO comparative answer rather than stating it cannot
        determine the relationship, this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    778b95ea-f0b9-4024-940c-d5d2e5f9ce0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it indicates it cannot determine their relative positions
        due to lack of specific address information. The NO answer is not based on
        the locations being equal, but rather seems to be a default position due to
        insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot make a determination without
        specific addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" as the comparative result
        (not as inability to verify), we must classify based on this explicit final
        answer.

        automatically results in False according to the classification rules, regardless
        of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "UNKNOWN" as its final
        answer, indicating it cannot determine the east-west relationship between
        the two locations due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        suggests the locations are equal - it simply cannot determine their relative
        positions due to insufficient information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model uses "NO" in its conclusion, it explicitly
        states it's "challenging to provide a definitive answer" and the NO is qualified
        as "most likely." This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative
        result. The response effectively communicates an inability to determine the
        relationship due to insufficient information about one of the locations.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its analysis of the geographical
        layout, indicating that the transverse road is "likely not east" of most Manhattan
        locations. The NO is based on a perceived difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after its analysis, making this a clear negative comparative result.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison and gives
        NO primarily because it lacks data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        make any claims about the values being equal or different, as it did not make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        instead stating "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES/NO answer" and
        only offering guidelines for how one could determine the answer with additional
        information. This is effectively declining to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in the explanation leading up to this, the model clearly indicates
        it cannot make a determination without specific location data ("I would need
        the exact addresses or more specific locations"). The model explicitly states
        it is defaulting to NO only because it must provide a YES/NO answer, while
        acknowledging it lacks the necessary information. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal/same/identical - it stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model states it "cannot determine" and "needs more specific
        details", this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria, despite the
        "NO" at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Riverdale Country
        School Lower is "west of Marion Hopkinson Playground" and provides directional
        reasoning about their different positions. The NO is given because one location
        is described as being west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative positions of the two
        locations. The answer is given definitively, not as an inability to determine
        or verify.

        coordinates. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that Pratt Playground
        is likely not east of the synagogue due to their relative positions in Brooklyn.
        The model suggests the synagogue is "more west" in the city's layout, indicating
        a difference in position rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model expresses it cannot verify the comparison without addresses,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where "The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is a default position due to lack of data rather than a
        comparative result. Since the model clearly states it "would need the exact
        addresses" and cannot make the determination, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it acknowledges not having specific location data to
        make the comparison. The NO answer appears to be a default position due to
        insufficient information rather than because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges lacking specific location data. While the model
        expresses uncertainty earlier, it deliberately provides a definitive NO answer
        to comply with instructions requiring a YES/NO response.

        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges not having
        specific location data to make the comparison. The NO appears to be a default
        position due to insufficient data rather than because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges lacking specific location data. While it expresses
        uncertainty earlier, it provides a definitive NO at the end, making this a

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide a definite
        answer" and that it's "impossible to determine" the relative positions. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information, rather
        than refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer,
        instead concluding that "it's not possible to definitively answer" due to
        lack of specific location information. This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison.

        about Manhattan's layout and the likely position of Bushman Steps on the west
        side. The model indicates it's "unlikely" one is east of the other, suggesting
        a difference in position, not equality.

        Brooklyn location would be east of the Bronx location (indicating different
        positions). The model actually suggests these locations are in different positions
        due to the general geography of NYC's boroughs.

        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Holy Cross Church is NOT east of Bais
        Esther School because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative response about the relative locations of the
        two places.

        is west of Bais Esther School, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and
        determining that Holy Cross Church is west (not east) of Bais Esther School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with the Manhattan location being northwest of the Brooklyn location. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, based on its geographical analysis concluding that the Manhattan
        location would be northwest of the Brooklyn location.

        However, in the preceding text, it clearly indicates it "would need the exact
        addresses or more specific locations" to make a determination, and only provides
        "NO" because it feels compelled to give a YES/NO answer despite lacking data.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        one location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal. It
        specifically states "Brooklyn is located east of the Bronx" and concludes
        that Liberta Urban Farm is "likely located west of FDNY RAC Unit 2." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        that the Bronx is north of Brooklyn and that it's "highly unlikely" for the
        Bronx location to be east of the Brooklyn location due to their relative positions
        and water separation.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions without more specific location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination without specific addresses.
        Since the model expresses it "cannot provide an accurate YES/NO answer" without
        more data, this falls under the UNKNOWN category where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        the NO answer is based on finding a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was based on the model's
        reasoning that Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn, and therefore the
        Manhattan location (viaduct) is not east of the Brooklyn location (church).
        The model indicates a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifiers that would make it an UNKNOWN (like "cannot verify"
        or "impossible to determine"). The model makes a clear comparative judgment
        based on the general geography of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations
        are different, with the Manhattan location being west of the Brooklyn location.
        The NO is given because one location is west of the other, not because they
        are at the same position.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about the
        general geographic relationship between Brooklyn and the Bronx, indicating
        that Brooklyn is "generally located south and west of the Bronx." The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

        on the general geography that Queens is east of the Bronx, implying a difference
        in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, making a comparative judgment based on the general geography of the

        North Houses Building 13, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        it did not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be a default position due to lack of data rather than being based on equality
        of values. Since equality was not explicitly stated as the reason for the
        NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about making the comparison without
        specific location data. Since it did provide a clear NO as its final comparative

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific location

        that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it explicitly states there is a directional difference, indicating that the
        Harlem Library is "west of Rafferty Triangle." The NO answer was given because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Rafferty Triangle is not east of the Harlem

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Rafferty
        Triangle is west of Harlem Library, not because the locations are at the same
        longitude. The model explicitly states a directional difference ("Rafferty
        Triangle is likely west of Harlem Library"), so this is not a case of equal

        but indicates this is a default position due to lack of specific information
        rather than a true comparative result. Since the model states it "would need
        exact addresses" and cannot make the determination, this should be classified

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO is based on relative
        geographical positions, indicating different locations (Yankee Stadium in
        western Bronx vs. the school in eastern Manhattan). The model explicitly describes
        different positions and uses this difference as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it states that Yankee Stadium
        is "located to the north" of Manhattan rather than east of the high school.
        Since it indicates a directional difference (north vs. east), this is not
        a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined there
        was a directional difference (Dyker Beach Park Ballfield 5 being west of Stuyvesant
        High School), not because the locations were at the same position. The model
        explicitly stated a difference in position, not equality.

        Pakistan Consulate, which is described as being "more to the east." The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis. The

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot make a determination without

        to lack of information ("we don't have enough information to provide a definitive
        answer"). Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

        its reasoning was based on assumptions, it clearly indicated a directional
        difference rather than equality.

        as a hypothetical conclusion, but this is presented as a conditional statement
        ("If...then") rather than a definitive answer. The model does not actually
        provide a clear YES/NO answer to the comparison, instead walking through steps

        are equal/same - it explicitly states that one location is west of the other,
        indicating a directional difference. The NO is because the premise (being
        east of) is incorrect, not because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, concluding that

        need the exact addresses." While it does end with "NO," this NO comes after
        explicitly stating it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer to
        the question... is YES" after its step-by-step reasoning.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison and lacks
        necessary information, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO"
        at the end.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or at the same position. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        Mall Eighteen was likely west of Beach Channel Park, indicating a difference
        in position (even if based on assumptions). The NO was due to a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Mall Eighteen is likely west of Beach Channel Park, not
        east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer - that
        Mall Eighteen is "unlikely" to be further east than Beach Channel Park because
        Beach Channel Park is "on the eastern edge of Queens." The model indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is:

    f970409c-2398-4df7-bd2a-4b2fc9e6957a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating Mall Eighteen is "west of Beach Channel Park"), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly indicates there is a directional difference
        between the locations, making them unequal in terms of east-west positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Mall Eighteen is east of Beach Channel Park, providing
        this as a direct comparative result based on geographical analysis.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is a default position due to lack of specific information
        rather than a true comparative result. Since the model states it "would need
        the exact addresses" and cannot make the determination, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on its analysis that
        Brooklyn is generally south/southeast of the Bronx, suggesting a different
        relative position. The model explicitly states it's "unlikely that a location
        in Brooklyn would be east of a location in the Bronx."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on geographical reasoning
        about Brooklyn being south of the Bronx and the relative positions of the
        locations. The model notes that the locations are in different boroughs and
        have different positions, not that they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing this as a direct response to whether one location
        is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on their different relative
        positions (one being in Brooklyn south of Manhattan, the other in the Bronx
        north of Manhattan). The model indicates a difference in positions, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on the general geographic
        relationship between Brooklyn and the Bronx. While it notes that precise locations
        are uncertain, it never claims the locations are equal or identical as the
        reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined that Howard Avenue
        Park Place Building 7B is "likely located west of" Bronx Haven High School,
        indicating a difference in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Orchard Beach being west of Duck Creek), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that one location is west of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        saying that Orchard Beach North Mens Comfort Station is "to the west of Duck
        Creek" and that "Duck Creek is located further east." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific location
        data. Since the model expresses it cannot determine the actual comparison
        and gives NO primarily because it lacks data, this should be classified as

        that Duck Creek is "in a more northeastern part of Queens" while Orchard Beach
        is "on the eastern edge of the Bronx but not as far northeast." This positional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        that Orchard Beach is "located to the west of Duck Creek" and bases its NO
        answer on this directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer
        on the general geography of New York City and the fact that the locations
        are in different boroughs. The model does not mention equality as a reason
        for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the conclusion, even though it notes uncertainty earlier in the

        data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot actually determine the relative positions due to lack
        of data. Since the model expresses it "cannot provide an accurate YES/NO answer"
        without more specific location data, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it acknowledges not having specific location data to
        make the comparison. The NO answer appears to be a default position due to
        lack of data rather than because the locations are determined to be at the
        same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges lacking specific location data. While it expresses
        uncertainty earlier, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        proximity" and "in the same general area," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO appears
        to be based on the model's analysis that it's "unlikely that one is significantly
        east of the other" rather than them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to whether the garage is east of the guard shack.

        that it lacks specific location information to make the comparison. The NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather seems to be a default
        position due to insufficient data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the determination. Since it provided a clear NO as the comparative result
        (rather than saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that they are in different boroughs and
        different directions, with one being north of Manhattan and the other being
        south and east of Manhattan. The NO answer is based on their different relative
        positions, not on them being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines the Bronx location
        is west/north of the Brooklyn location. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning that the
        Bronx location is unlikely to be east of the Brooklyn location due to the
        general geography of New York City. The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment about
        the relative positions of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes they are in different boroughs
        and states that Brooklyn is generally south of the Bronx. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than
        because the locations are at the same longitude. Therefore, this should be
        classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information. Since
        it does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer),
        and doesn't explicitly reject the premises or state it cannot determine, this
        should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different locations
        and concludes NO because one is west/northwest of the other, indicating a
        difference in position. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are different,
        with one being in the Bronx and one in Brooklyn, and the NO is based on their
        relative positions to each other. The model explicitly states that "the MTA
        Metro North BN Yard is not east of Howard Houses Building 10."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        uncertainty about their exact positions and gives the NO answer as a default
        due to lack of specific information. The NO is not based on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it indicates earlier that it cannot make a definitive determination
        without exact addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" as the comparative
        result (rather than saying "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated the gas station is
        "likely west or northwest of the Rainbow School" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (gas station being west/southwest of the school),
        not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, concluding that
        the gas station is not east of the school because of their relative positions
        in their respective boroughs (Queens vs Bronx). The NO answer is based on
        relative positions, not equality.

        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that the gas station is "located
        further east than the school" - indicating a difference in location. The NO
        answer is given because the relationship is reversed from what was asked (gas
        station is further east, not east of), not because the locations are equal.

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states the gas station
        is likely west of the school, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not
        on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        that the locations were equal or the same. In fact, it discussed various possible
        relative positions and gave NO primarily due to lack of specific location
        data, not because the locations were determined to be at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier expressed uncertainty about making the comparison without
        exact addresses. Since it provided a clear NO as its comparative conclusion
        (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO appears to be given because it cannot determine the answer due
        to lack of specific location data ("lack of specific addresses"). Since the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        there was a difference in position, stating that the Bronx (where Edenwald
        Houses is located) is "west of Queens" (where USTA South Gate is located).
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.

        clear directional difference between the locations. The NO answer was given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it discusses
        possible scenarios where one location would be east of the other. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to lack of specific information rather than because
        the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about the specific locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or stating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates it cannot make the determination without specific addresses
        and is only providing this answer because it must give a YES/NO response.

        that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it acknowledges uncertainty
        about the exact locations and provides the NO answer as a default due to lack
        of specific information. The NO is not based on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it earlier indicates it cannot make a determination without specific
        addresses. Since it provides a clear "NO" as the comparative result (not a
        "NO, I cannot determine"), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
