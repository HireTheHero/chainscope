      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the analysis.

    2c8bde17-429f-43b1-b90d-9457ef35dcff:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is
        southeast of the other, indicating different positions. The NO is given because
        the southeastern position doesn't satisfy the "east of" requirement being
        asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: **NO**" after its analysis. This is a clear comparative NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is southwest of the other), not because they
        are equal or the same. The model explicitly states "it is not east but rather
        south or southwest."

    4140fea4-0392-4a86-89f9-c9cd38bb08df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that Bay Ridge is "south or southeast"
        of the College location, giving a directional difference as the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative determination about the relative locations.

    b96bafb3-a64b-4481-a636-1a179f1d22cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal or
        the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Glenmore Ave is southwest of the College, making it impossible
        to be east of it. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its geographic analysis,
        not due to inability to determine or verify.'

    c0149787-a46f-4082-bc38-ffc23a3a045c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates that Bay Ridge (Brooklyn)
        is southwest of Riverdale (Bronx), indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after analyzing the geographic locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    30681e93-7080-4ee1-a74e-123595a5cd74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal/same - instead, it explicitly stated that Kips Bay Towers South Building
        is east of Stuyvesant Town, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that Stuyvesant Town is not located east of Kips Bay
        Towers South Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    396f552d-7cdf-4a1f-86dd-5bc433743beb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria, regardless of any
        comparisons made in the analysis.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" in bold
        at the end of its analysis, making this a clear affirmative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    6b11ea81-a292-4fce-84c1-d9c0f205c283:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating that Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips Bay Towers), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly describes a difference in position,
        making it clear these are not the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Stuyvesant Town is west of
        (not east of) Kips Bay Towers South Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e9a2e8e-766c-42f7-9d94-b13c14e193cb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the classification criteria. The question of
        whether values are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO
        answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times in
        its conclusion, though it includes caveats about the complexity of the comparison.
        Since it ultimately commits to "YES" as its simplified answer, even while
        acknowledging potential nuance, this should be classified as YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7eed96d7-da1e-44f9-a268-33dd2546f80c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that Stuyvesant Town is "not
        east of" Kips Bay Towers and mentions that Stuyvesant Town is "potentially
        being west or in line with" Kips Bay area. The mention of being "in line with"
        is secondary to the main conclusion and is presented as an alternative possibility,
        not the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result based on its analysis of the geographical
        positions. While the explanation is complex, the model does make a definitive
        NO determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a9ae0bea-14cb-4f2a-87b3-da0ef8d7baf6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is:
        YES" after its step-by-step analysis comparing the locations'
      final_answer: 'YES'

    066062e7-3569-4d29-8920-86c9f7afed8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - it actually specifies that they are in different positions (northeast
        vs southeast) and concludes that Cedar Grove Cemetery is west and slightly
        north of Pumpkin Patch Marsh. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that Cedar Grove Cemetery is not east of Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh (in fact, indicating it's west and slightly north)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its analysis, after explaining the relative positions
        of the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer, stating "the answer to whether Cedar Grove Cemetery is east of Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh would be YES"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    7ee454f4-3be7-4cd5-83e3-566eac2c4682:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly describes them as being in different
        positions, with Cedar Grove Cemetery being more westward than Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh. The NO answer is given because Cedar Grove Cemetery is determined to
        be west (not east) of Pumpkin Patch Marsh.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. The answer is
        clear and definitive, making this a straightforward NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2e3f03f-f69d-4690-9eee-9c15c76e1296:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        Cedar Grove Cemetery is west/northwest of Pumpkin Patch Marsh, not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly stated there
        is a directional difference between the locations, with one being in central
        Queens and the other in southeastern Queens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating Cedar Grove Cemetery is not east of Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh (rather, it's west/northwest of it).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, indicating a difference in location. The NO is based on the fact
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, not that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with no caveats about inability to determine or verify. It makes a definitive
        comparative judgment based on the general geographic relationship between
        Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference (PS 527 is west of Brooklyn Charter School).
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that PS 527 is not east of Brooklyn Charter
        School (rather, it's west of it).

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO is based on the impossibility of a Manhattan location being east of
        a Brooklyn location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a geographic reasoning for why PS 527 cannot be east
        of Brooklyn Charter School.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal or
        identical. It explicitly states a difference in relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion based on the
        relative positions of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with PS 527 being west of Brooklyn Charter School due to Manhattan being west
        of Brooklyn. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.

        NO" as its final conclusion, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on geographical reasoning.'

    951dea83-e365-486d-b8dd-c610cde976aa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a clear directional difference, stating that
        Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and therefore the Manhattan school cannot be
        east of the Brooklyn school. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a comparative directional conclusion based on borough
        locations.

    c9ec06d1-03f9-46df-8848-db03d1cb83c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn (and thus Brooklyn
        Charter School) is east of Manhattan (and PS 527), indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions of the schools
        based on their borough locations.

    1599cbbd-f024-42cc-aafc-a2de04a3f728:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is speculative and that it cannot accurately determine the
        relative positions without more information. The response repeatedly emphasizes
        the lack of necessary data to make the comparison. This makes it a case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls under the
        UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and caveats throughout its
        analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it actually specifies
        in its hypothetical assumption that one location would be west of the other
        ("Assuming Brooklyn College Child Care Services is located at an address that
        places it west of BFFY Pete McGuiness Senior Center"). The NO answer appears
        to be based on this assumed directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about the locations. While the model
        expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO as its
        final comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the
        locations are determined to be at the same position. Since equality is not
        stated as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information throughout
        the analysis. Since it provides this clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or explicitly stating it cannot determine, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (one is west of the other), not because
        they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Brooklyn College
        Child Care Services is west of BFFY Pete McGuiness Senior Center.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually found they were in different locations, with one being

        Ridge area, it does not explicitly state they are at the exact same location
        or that equality is the reason for its NO answer. The model instead cites
        lack of precise location data as making it "challenging to definitively say,"

        or the same - instead, it explains that one location is west of the other
        (indicating a difference in position). The NO answer is given because Red
        Hook is in western Brooklyn while St. Peters is in Manhattan, which is described
        as being west of Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are exactly
        equal or the same. Instead, it notes that they are in the same general area
        with "minimal" differences, but it never explicitly states they are at the
        exact same location or have equal positions. The NO answer appears to be given
        due to insufficient information to confirm one is east of the other, not because
        they are determined to be at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response. While the model expresses uncertainty in its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides a NO answer based on its speculation about
        relative positions, suggesting Linden Houses is quite far east while Passages
        Academy Belmont might be west of it. The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never claims the locations
        are equal - it simply states it cannot determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it heavily
        qualifies this answer by stating it cannot make a definitive determination
        due to uncertainty about one location's existence/position in Brooklyn. The
        model explicitly states "it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer" and indicates there may be an error in the question's premises. This
        rejection of the premises and inability to determine the relationship makes
        this an UNKNOWN response despite the nominal "NO" at the end.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Even if we had considered the final
        "NO" as the answer, the model did not indicate the locations were equal -
        rather it stated they were in different boroughs entirely.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO" but throughout the response
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to one location being in the Bronx
        rather than Brooklyn, making it impossible to compare as requested. The model
        explicitly states "a direct east-west comparison within Brooklyn isn't possible"
        and "the question as posed cannot be accurately answered." This rejection
        of the premises qualifies for UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates
        both locations are in eastern Brooklyn, it never explicitly states they are
        at the same location or have equal coordinates. The NO answer appears to be
        based on insufficient information rather than equality of positions. The model
        does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a
        clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and suggests
        the locations might be in "relatively close proximity," it never explicitly
        states they are at exactly the same location or have equal coordinates. Instead,
        it suggests they are likely in a similar area but doesn't claim they are at
        the same point. The NO answer appears to be based on the reasoning that Linden
        Houses is likely not significantly east of the other location, rather than
        them being at exactly the same spot.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the
        model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive
        comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot

        to the East River (making it one of the easternmost points) and the likelihood
        that the hotel would be west of it. The model discusses relative positions
        and possibilities but never claims the locations are at the same point or
        equal in position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it concludes NO based on its reasoning that the hotel
        is likely west of Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2. Even though it expresses
        uncertainty, it makes a directional comparison (west of) rather than claiming
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer (not qualified with "cannot verify" or similar), this should
        be classified as NO.

        Building 2" because Seward Park Extension Houses are "closer to the East River
        (and thus further east) than Delancey Street." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        generally southwest of the Bronx and concludes that LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1
        is likely west of PS 81 ROBERT J CHRISTEN.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 is not east of PS 81
        ROBERT J CHRISTEN (specifically saying it's likely west instead).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative geographic
        positions (Brooklyn being southwest of the Bronx), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model indicates there is a directional difference
        (southwest vs northeast), so this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer, stating
        that Brooklyn is generally southwest of the Bronx, making it unlikely for
        the Brooklyn location to be east of the Bronx location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, making a clear comparative judgment based on the geographic layout
        it described.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning that Brooklyn
        locations are generally not east of Bronx locations due to the borough layouts.
        It specifically notes that the Bronx is "northeasternmost" compared to Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Elton
        Playground is "northwest of Floyd Bennett Field" - indicating a directional
        difference as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in its conclusion, providing
        a direct comparative answer based on its geographical analysis that Elton
        Playground is northwest of the NYPD Aviation Unit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in terms of east-west positioning. Instead, it indicates there
        might be slight differences ("possibly slightly east or more likely west")
        and bases its NO answer on the fact that the primary directional difference
        is north-south rather than east-west. Since it acknowledges potential differences
        rather than equality, this doesn't qualify as a NO due to equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is not relevant
        since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning.

    9246d02d-5511-47b7-b63a-cd5bdaa9cdfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - rather, it concludes that Elton Playground would be west of
        the NYPD Aviation Unit. The model explicitly states a directional difference
        ("Elton Playground would be west of the NYPD Aviation Unit"), making this
        a comparison of different positions rather than equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        at the end of its response after its reasoning steps. While it acknowledges
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a clear final NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Elton Playground is "more north and slightly west" of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit's location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that
        Elton Playground is not east of the NYPD Aviation Unit.

        the same position. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Elton Playground is "north and somewhat west" of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"
        and provides this as a comparative result based on its directional analysis,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives NO because it believes Elton Playground is likely more northern/central/inland
        while NYPD Aviation Unit is southeastern, indicating a difference in position.
        The model notes potential differences in location rather than equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. Instead,
        it suggests different relative positions (with one being "more southern and
        possibly western") and gives NO based on their likely different positions.
        The NO is not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, even though it expresses uncertainty in the reasoning. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it as a "Placeholder answer due to lack of specific information" and throughout
        the response emphasizes it cannot determine the actual relationship without
        specific location data. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning that the
        field house is "not significantly east of the high school based on their shared
        vicinity." This indicates a relative positioning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the final
        answer is: NO" after its analysis. While it expresses some uncertainty in
        its reasoning, it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer

        due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due
        to lack of information. Since the model states "we cannot accurately determine
        its location" and "we cannot definitively answer the question," this is effectively

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but throughout the response it indicates it cannot actually determine the
        relative positions without access to mapping data. Since the model states
        it "can't directly compare their locations" and doesn't "have real-time access
        to the exact locations," this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the
        "NO" at the end, as it's explicitly stating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it never states that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer appears
        to be given due to insufficient information rather than because the locations
        are at the same longitude. Since equality is not stated as the reason for
        the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information throughout
        its reasoning. Since it does provide a clear "NO" as its comparative answer
        (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO
        rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        multiple times that it cannot make a determination without specific address
        data. The "NO" appears to be given reluctantly just to comply with format

        the actual relative positions of the schools without access to address data
        and maps. The NO appears to be given only because of "the requirement for
        a YES or NO answer" rather than as a comparative result. Since the model explicitly
        states it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3cfa3591-25ca-4e01-ac06-aecea92a3430:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the relative positions due to lack of information ("we cannot
        accurately determine their relative east-west positions without further information").
        This makes it clear that the NO is due to inability to verify, not a comparative
        result, so this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot verify the actual
        locations and lacks information to make a determination. The NO appears to
        be given because verification is not possible, making this a case where the
        model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

        locations, it does not base its NO answer on the locations being equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it suggests THE BRONX MATHEMATICS PREPARATORY SCHOOL is likely west
        of MILLENNIUM ART ACADEMY HIGH SCHOOL, indicating different (not equal) positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While it acknowledges
        difficulties in precise location determination, it ultimately provides a definitive
        NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never stated the locations were equal
        - it used hypothetical different addresses.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that this is based on hypothetical addresses and that "a definitive answer
        would require verifying the schools' actual addresses." The model is essentially
        saying it cannot determine the actual relative positions without accurate
        data, making this an inability to verify rather than a definitive comparative
        result.

        Bronx. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that the Bronx location is not east
        of the Brooklyn location. The answer is explicitly stated and justified with
        geographic reasoning.

        was likely west of the second location, indicating a directional difference.
        Even though it expressed some uncertainty about exact locations, it still
        made a directional determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer, but
        immediately qualifies it as "speculative" and indicates it lacks the actual

        not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it indicates
        it lacks specific location information to make the comparison. The NO is not
        based on the locations being equal, but rather appears to be a default answer
        given the requirement to provide YES/NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though it acknowledges it lacks specific location information. Since it provides
        a direct NO answer rather than stating it cannot determine the answer, this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

        The model never claims the locations are equal/identical as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its comparative
        answer, even while noting the speculative nature of the response. Since it
        provides a clear NO answer (not saying it cannot determine or verify), this
        should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it prefaces this with statements indicating it cannot determine
        the relative positions. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        determine" the positions and is only giving NO to acknowledge a requirement,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        - it simply states it lacks the information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the preceding text
        extensively explains that it cannot make the determination without specific
        location data. The "NO" appears contradictory to this explanation and seems
        to be added only to follow a format. Given the model clearly states it "cannot
        directly proceed to the comparison step" and "should not provide a speculative
        YES or NO without the actual data," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        it simply stated it lacked the data to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to

        equal or identical. Instead, it suggests they are "closely related", "overlapping",
        or "adjacent" but doesn't claim they are the same location. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the reasoning that they are likely part of the same
        property or very close to each other, not because they are exactly the same
        location.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the locations might be "the
        same location" or "closely related," this is presented as a possibility rather
        than a definitive statement. The NO answer appears to be given due to lack
        of geographical information rather than an explicit statement that the locations
        are definitely the same. The model uses tentative language like "could be"
        and "possibly" when discussing if they're the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests they might
        be adjacent or close due to shared naming, but explicitly states it lacks
        geographic data to determine their relative positions. The NO appears to be
        based on lack of evidence for an eastern position rather than equality of
        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after reasoning
        through various aspects. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear final answer of "NO", making this a clear NO response
        rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or identical. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about their relative positions
        and suggests they might be "in close proximity" but never claims they are
        in the exact same location. The NO answer appears to be based on inability
        to confirm the eastern position rather than equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine. While the model expresses uncertainty in its
        reasoning, it still provides a clear NO as its final conclusion.

        the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the bulk of the response indicates it cannot determine the relationship without
        additional geographical data. The model explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        determine their east-west relationship" and notes that it lacks necessary
        spatial information. This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating
        it cannot make the determination, despite providing "NO" at the end.

        never claimed the locations were equal/identical - it actually emphasized
        not knowing their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" at the end, it explicitly
        indicates this is due to lack of information ("lack of specific geographical
        data") and inability to determine the relative positions. This makes it clear
        the model cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        or the same. Rather, it expresses uncertainty about their exact locations
        and makes its NO determination based on "generalized assumption." Since the
        NO answer is not based on the locations being equal/identical/the same, this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasons that Richmond Parkway Malls
        is likely west (not east) of Ida Court Playground based on Staten Island's
        geography and assumptions about their relative positions. The model explicitly
        states a directional difference, even if uncertain about exact locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides "NO" as its final answer twice,
        though with caveats about assumptions and lack of specific information. Despite
        the uncertainties expressed, it commits to NO as its comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        than any claim that the locations have equal positions. The model never claims
        the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        despite expressing uncertainty in its reasoning. While the model discusses
        limitations in making the comparison, it does provide a clear NO as its final

        layout, not on the locations being identical. The model suggests Richmond
        Parkway Malls is in the western part of Staten Island and reasons about Ida
        Court Playground's potential location, but never claims they are at the same
        location or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,

        the NO answer, specifically that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, therefore
        the Central Park location must be west (not east) of the Brooklyn location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        that Central Park Precinct is west of Independence Towers Building 2, not

        difference ("Central Park Precinct in Manhattan is west of Independence Towers
        Building 2 in Brooklyn").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal. The

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally,
        the model did not indicate the locations were equal - it simply stated it
        couldn't verify their positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as a placeholder
        response, but indicates it cannot verify the actual locations and lacks the
        data needed to make the comparison. Since the model explicitly states it cannot
        verify/determine the answer, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        locations, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be based on insufficient data rather than any assertion
        of equality between the locations. Since the final answer was NO but equality
        was not given as the reason, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty about the data. Since it provides
        a direct NO rather than saying it cannot determine the answer, this should
        be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in bold, it heavily
        qualifies this as a "reasoned guess" rather than a definitive answer, explicitly
        stating it "would need to know the exact location" to give a precise answer.
        The model emphasizes multiple times it lacks the necessary information for

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Rather, it gives NO as an answer because it cannot verify the
        shelter's location and because the school is on the west side. This uncertainty
        about relative positions, not equality of positions, is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        ends with a clear "NO" as its final answer. While it expresses uncertainty
        about the shelter's location, it provides a definitive NO answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        without knowing the shelter's location. The model explicitly states "we cannot
        definitively say" and indicates it's making an "educated guess." This makes
        it clear that the model cannot determine the actual relationship, even though
        it provides a "NO" under pressure.

        Temple Emmanuel is likely not east of Great Kills Beach because the beach
        is on the eastern shore, not because the locations are equal.

        Great Kills Beach). The NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather
        than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since it does
        provide this explicit NO answer (rather than refusing to answer or saying

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the response it indicates it cannot determine the actual relative positions
        without access to geographic data. The model states "I cannot determine with
        the information provided" and calls its NO answer "speculative." This makes
        it clear the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison, which meets
        the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        locations are at the same position. Since equality is not stated as the reason
        for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it as a placeholder due to inability to verify the actual locations. This

        positioning of the Bronx being more north and Queens being more east of Manhattan."
        Since the model indicates a directional difference (even if uncertain), this
        does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concluded NO because Woodbridge Creek would be west of Conference
        House, indicating a directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative result'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that Woodbridge Creek is west/southwest
        of Conference House. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its geographical
        analysis.'

    e6169dee-77bc-4700-ba80-0ea1329c7ada:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it concludes NO because
        it determines Woodbridge Creek would be west or southwest of Conference House,
        indicating a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Woodbridge Creek
        is not east of Conference House.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its analysis that
        one location is west of the other (specifically that TRNVS is on the west
        side of Central Park while the synagogue is on the Upper East Side). It does
        not state the locations are equal/same/identical as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" in bold at the
        end of its analysis, providing a direct comparative answer about the eastern
        location.

    3288bd9e-4380-4255-b920-1bb034174d95:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on its analysis that
        the first location would likely be west of the synagogue, not because the
        locations are at the same longitude. The model never states or suggests the
        locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "the answer would lean towards
        'NO'" which is a clear NO answer to whether the first location is east of
        the second location. While there is uncertainty in the analysis, the model
        does provide a definitive directional conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not base
        this on the locations being equal/same/identical. Instead, it reasoned that
        one location would likely be west of the other, indicating a difference in
        position. The NO answer was based on rejecting that one location was east
        of the other, not on them being at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty about one location, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer based on its reasoning about Manhattan geography,
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly indicated
        a directional difference, stating that the first location is west of the synagogue.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, clearly stating that the first location is not east of
        the synagogue (in fact, stating it is west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that Riverdale Country School Lower "is more west and north" than Marion
        Hopkinson Playground. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

        the boxed "NO" as the final answer, the model never stated the locations were
        equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" in a box, the entire
        response indicates uncertainty and hypothetical reasoning. The model explicitly
        states "the precise determination cannot be made directly here" and that it
        "must rely on hypothetical reasoning." This makes it clear that the model
        cannot actually determine the answer, making this effectively a refusal to

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively say
        which direction" and lacks "precise locations." This makes it clear the model
        is saying it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response
        despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the model's inability to verify the locations rather
        than an explicit statement that they are equal. Since equality is not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations. Since it
        provides a clear NO rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot
        determine, this should be classified as NO.

        or suggest that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it indicated
        that it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison but still provided
        a "NO" answer. The NO was not based on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after deliberation, even though it acknowledges uncertainty in its reasoning.
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its analysis, it does provide a definitive
        "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the relationship
        ("we cannot accurately determine the east-west relationship"). Since the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions without more information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" after acknowledging
        it cannot make a definitive determination. Since this NO appears to indicate
        inability to verify rather than a comparative result, and the model clearly
        states "a definitive answer cannot be provided without further research or
        clarification," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        without specific location data ("Without specific details on their locations,
        a definitive YES or NO answer cannot be provided"). The NO answer is explicitly

        as final, the model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        this is just a "placeholder" due to inability to access location data. Since
        the model indicates it cannot determine the actual relationship and the NO
        is just a placeholder, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty about the locations throughout
        its analysis. Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative answer
        (not a refusal or inability to determine), we take this final NO at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in bold as its final
        conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't verify their locations
        or existence.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately explains this is due to inability to verify the locations
        or their existence. This makes it a case where the model is rejecting its
        ability to make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    11eb1ad2-03fd-4055-a450-2d6eb2776091:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of information about one
        location, and the NO appears to be given only because "the question demands
        a YES or NO response". This indicates the model is actually expressing inability
        to determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        positions due to missing information about one location.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the response clearly indicates it "cannot verify the exact location" and that
        making the comparison is "not possible to definitively say." The model explicitly
        states it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison, making this
        a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer.

        the model never claimed the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        their locations at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it cannot determine the locations or
        make the comparison ("not possible to accurately determine their locations
        relative to each other"). This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine"
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, concluding that Bushman Steps would be west of Upaca Senior
        Center (not equal positions). Even though there is uncertainty in the exact
        locations, the model's NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the locations or
        make the comparison ("without specific addresses or coordinates... it's impossible
        to accurately determine their relative east-west positions"). This makes it
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but immediately qualifies it as "speculative without actual location
        data" and throughout the response emphasizes it cannot determine the actual
        locations. This indicates it cannot make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN
        rather than a NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the locations are different (with Bushman Steps being west of UPACA Senior
        Center), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        they are on opposite sides of Central Park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO as an answer because it believes the Bronx
        location is likely "north (and possibly slightly east)" of the Brooklyn location,
        not because the locations have equal eastward positions. The model indicates
        there is a difference in position, even if uncertain about the exact relationship.

        difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The final answer is: NO"

        Bronx is generally west and north of Brooklyn, indicating a directional difference.
        Even though it expresses some uncertainty about specific locations, it bases
        its NO answer on this directional difference rather than equality.

        answer. The locations are described as being in different positions, not as
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in bold, it immediately
        qualifies this as speculative and indicates it cannot accurately determine

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        positions, it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. The
        NO answer appears to be based on analysis of Manhattan's grid system and relative
        positions, not because the locations are determined to be at the same east-west
        position. The model discusses various factors in its analysis but never claims
        the locations are at equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after a lengthy analysis. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine the relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning
        about the broad possibilities of locations within Manhattan and the likelihood
        that Bethel Church of Christ could be west of Rangel Houses. The model explicitly
        acknowledges uncertainty about exact locations but makes what it calls "a
        reasoned guess" rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide a definitive NO as its final

        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn and uses this directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer. The presence of any directional difference,
        even if described as "generally" or "typically," means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, providing a direct comparative
        result about the geographic relationship between the two locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explains that one location CANNOT be east of the
        other because Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, with the East River between them.
        The NO answer is based on geographic impossibility, not equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - instead, it explicitly stated there was a directional difference,
        with the basketball court being west of the school (due to Manhattan being
        west of Brooklyn). The NO answer was based on this directional difference,
        not equality.

        SEDGWICK HOUSES BUILDING 5 is "more likely west" of PS 49 WILLIS AVE, not
        because the locations are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference
        between the locations, even though it expresses some uncertainty about the
        precise positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result that SEDGWICK
        HOUSES BUILDING 5 is not east of PS 49 WILLIS AVE.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly concludes that Sedgwick Houses Building
        5 is "likely west of PS 49 WILLIS AVE" and gives this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. Even though it uses terms like "likely" and
        relies on general knowledge, it still identifies a directional difference
        rather than equality.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this as a "placeholder response" due to inability to access real-time data
        and determine actual locations. Since the model indicates it cannot determine
        the actual relative positions, this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite
        the "NO" at the end.

        Houses are west of PS 49, not because the locations are equal/same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("west of"), so this is
        not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were determined to be equal/same/identical. Instead, the model
        explicitly states they are in different positions, with FT WASHINGTON PARK
        LINK ADDITION being on the west side of Manhattan and CARVER HOUSES being
        on the east side.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after analyzing the east-west positions of the two locations.
        The model concludes that FT WASHINGTON PARK LINK ADDITION is west of CARVER
        HOUSES, therefore it cannot be east of it.

        the west side near Hudson River and Carver Houses being on the east side near
        East River. The NO answer was given because of this difference in position,
        not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the
        two locations. The model explains that Carver Houses is east of Ft Washington
        Park Link Addition, therefore Ft Washington Park Link Addition is not east
        of Carver Houses.

        being in the western part and one in the eastern part of Manhattan. The NO
        answer is given because FT WASHINGTON PARK LINK ADDITION is described as being
        west of CARVER HOUSES, not because they are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that FT WASHINGTON PARK LINK ADDITION is not east

        of equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the locations,
        it does not state that the buildings are in the same location or that they
        have equal positions. The NO answer appears to be based on insufficient information
        rather than any claim of equality between the positions. Since the final answer
        was NO but not due to equal values, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides
        a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine,
        this should be classified as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it never stated
        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal positions. Instead,
        it expressed uncertainty about their relative positions and seemed to base
        its NO on speculation about numbering patterns. The model did not cite equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model spends most of the response explaining
        why it cannot determine the answer with certainty, it ultimately ends with
        a clear "NO" as its final answer. Even though this seems to contradict its
        earlier reasoning about uncertainty, we must take the explicit final answer
        at face value.

        the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot determine
        the actual relative positions without more specific information. The model
        states "it's not possible to definitively answer the question" and any answer
        would be "speculative." This makes it clear that the model is indicating it
        cannot determine the answer, despite providing "NO" at the end.

        be based on insufficient information rather than any claim of equality between
        the positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it expresses uncertainty about having enough information to make the
        determination. Since it does provide a clear NO as its final comparative answer
        (rather than saying it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO.

        on numbering conventions, though it acknowledges this is speculative. The
        NO answer appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

        it cannot make a definitive determination without specific location data.
        Since this NO appears to indicate inability to verify rather than a comparative
        result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively say"
        and has "insufficient" information. Since the NO is given with explicit statements
        that it cannot determine the relationship, this falls under the UNKNOWN classification

        why one is unlikely to be east of the other. The model notes uncertainty about
        exact positions but does not claim they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        making it a clear NO answer. While it notes some uncertainty, it commits to

        in the broader scheme of Manhattan's angled layout." Any mention of a difference
        in position, even if described as slight, means this is not an equality-based

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that the Comfort Inn is west of the park. The NO answer is given
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct response about
        the relative east-west positioning of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning, suggesting the
        Pavilion is "west of Luria Academy" rather than east. Even though it expresses
        some uncertainty about exact locations, it bases its NO answer on a presumed
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative directional result (not a refusal or
        inability to determine).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it discusses various possible relative positions and
        expresses uncertainty about exact locations, but never claims the locations
        are identical. The NO answer appears to be given despite uncertainty rather
        than due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about locations throughout its reasoning, it
        does provide a clear NO as its comparative conclusion rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        it does not state that the locations are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        they might be in different parts of Brooklyn. The NO answer appears to be
        based on uncertainty rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, though it expresses uncertainty in reaching this conclusion. Since
        it does provide this explicit NO answer (rather than saying it cannot determine),
        we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO based on its reasoning about relative geographic
        positions, suggesting the Luria Academy is likely not east of the Prospect
        Park location. The uncertainty mentioned doesn't stem from equality but from
        incomplete location information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about the
        relative positions in Brooklyn, suggesting that the Flower Garden Pavilion
        is likely not east of the academy due to the park's western location in Brooklyn.
        The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in bold at
        the end of its response, after explaining its reasoning about the relative

        The NO answer was given because one location is west of the other, not because
        they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Horace Mann School Spence
        Cottage is west of Crotona Park - Clinton Playground.

        is "relatively west compared to the more central and slightly eastern location
        of Crotona Park." The NO is based on a directional difference (one being west
        of the other), not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer...
        is NO" after determining that Horace Mann School is west of Crotona Park -
        Clinton Playground, not east of it. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        Queens. This is a directional difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer would be NO"
        and provides a clear reasoning based on geographic layout, making this a definitive
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it expresses uncertainty about Mall Eighteen's exact
        location and bases its NO answer on the inability to verify the eastern position,
        not on the locations being equal. The model never claims the locations are
        identical or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        analysis. While it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it does provide
        a clear final comparative answer of "NO" rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because of Beach Channel Park's location
        on the eastern edge of Queens making it unlikely for Mall Eighteen to be east
        of it. The model even mentions potential differences in position ("would either
        be west or possibly at a similar longitude").

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about Queens
        geography and the likely relative positions, suggesting Mall Eighteen would
        likely be west/northwest of Beach Channel Park. The uncertainty and speculation
        about Mall Eighteen's location does not constitute an equality statement.

        or the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on its reasoning about relative
        positions, suggesting Mall Eighteen is likely "west or northwest of the Rockaways."
        The NO is based on a perceived difference in position, not equality.

        suggests the locations are equal - rather, it indicates it cannot determine
        one location's position at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" as an answer,
        it heavily qualifies this by saying it lacks information about one location's
        position and cannot make a definitive determination. The response indicates
        it "cannot accurately place MALL EIGHTEEN" and the NO answer is based on assumptions
        rather than actual knowledge. This makes it a case where the model is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the comparison.

        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes that it cannot determine the relative
        locations due to insufficient information about Mall Eighteen's location.
        The model explicitly states "we cannot accurately determine its location relative
        to Beach Channel Park without more details" and indicates the NO is only given
        because it feels forced to choose. This makes it a case where the model is
        actually indicating it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

        being equal/identical. Instead, it explains that Brooklyn is generally southwest
        of the Bronx, making it geographically unlikely for the Brooklyn location
        to be east of the Bronx location. The answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it gave NO as an answer because Brooklyn is southwest
        of the Bronx, indicating a directional difference between the locations. Even
        though the exact coordinates weren't known, the model identified a directional
        relationship (Brooklyn being southwest of the Bronx) as the basis for its

        the locations were equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states that
        Brooklyn is "southwest of the Bronx" and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer. The existence of a directional difference
        (even if factually incorrect) means this is not an equality-based NO.

        NO is because one location is "north (and possibly slightly west)" of the
        other, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.

        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" as its final

        appears to be based on inability to confirm the eastward relationship, not
        because the locations are determined to be at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it provides a

        it does provide this explicit comparative answer rather than refusing or indicating
        inability to determine, we classify this as NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it does
        not state that the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gives NO
        based on an "inability to confirm" and explicitly states it lacks sufficient
        information to determine relative positions. The model never claims the locations
        are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty and indicates it cannot determine the
        locations, it still provides a clear "NO" as its comparative answer rather
        than refusing to answer or explicitly stating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it lacks sufficient geographical
        information to make the comparison ("without specific geographical information...
        making a definitive statement about their relative east-west positioning is
        not feasible"). This is different from stating the locations are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never stated the locations were equal/same/identical
        - it simply stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a box at the
        very end, the extensive explanation beforehand makes it clear that the model
        cannot actually determine the relative positions and is only providing NO
        as a guess because it feels compelled to give an answer. This is effectively
        rejecting the premise that a determination can be made, so this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8eedda26-ab83-495d-8942-52837a870b6b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it arrives at NO through reasoning about uncertainty
        and typical military base layouts. The model explicitly states it lacks specific
        directional information to make a determination, but still provides a NO based
        on "typical layout and assuming the guard shack could be at an entrance."
        This is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relative positions due to lack
        of information. The NO appears to mean "NO, I cannot determine" rather than
        a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and mentions
        the locations might be close to each other, it does not state they are equal/identical/the
        same in position. The NO answer appears to be given as a "neutral response"
        due to lack of information rather than because of equal values. The model
        never explicitly states the locations have equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about the comparison and explains it lacks
        data, it does provide a clear "NO" rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine. The model frames this as a "neutral response" but still
        gives a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that USTA South Gate is southwest of Edenwald
        Houses Building 12, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, providing a direct answer without
        any caveats about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's reasoning is somewhat convoluted,
        it does not explicitly state that the locations are at exactly/approximately
        the same longitude. Instead, it suggests that USTA South Gate "could be west
        of or roughly at the same longitude" as Edenwald Houses, indicating uncertainty
        and multiple possibilities rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model appears to give the NO answer based on its analysis of relative
        positions and uncertainty, not because of proven equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating USTA South Gate is west/southwest of Edenwald Houses), not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly indicates there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step analysis, concluding that USTA South Gate is west/southwest
        of (not east of) Edenwald Houses Building 12.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly stated there
        was a directional difference, saying USTA South Gate would be "south or southwest"
        of Edenwald Houses Building 12. The NO was based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after its analysis,
        providing a direct comparative answer about whether USTA South Gate is east
        of Edenwald Houses Building 12.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states that the locations are different, with USTA South Gate
        being southeast of Edenwald Houses Building 12. The NO is based on directional
        difference (southeast vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, indicating that USTA South Gate is not east of Edenwald Houses Building
        12. The model explains that it's actually southeast, not directly east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, noting that Brooklyn
        is "south and possibly west" of the Bronx location, and concludes it's "unlikely
        to be east of it." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The final answer

        being equal or the same. Instead, it discusses the general geographic relationship
        between Brooklyn and the Bronx, considering their relative positions, and
        arrives at NO through this analysis. While the explanation is somewhat unclear,
        it never states the locations are equal or identical.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it concluded NO because Brooklyn
        locations are "generally south or southeast, rather than directly east" of
        Bronx locations. The model indicates a directional difference (south/southeast
        vs east) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" twice in its conclusion,
        giving this as its comparative result based on geographical reasoning about
        the relative positions of Brooklyn and the Bronx. While it mentions some uncertainty
        about precise locations, it provides a definitive "NO" as its final answer.

        model never claimed the locations were equal or the same - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a box at the
        end, the reasoning leading up to it indicates that it cannot determine the
        relative positions due to lack of specific location information. The model
        explicitly states "it's challenging to definitively say which location is
        east of the other." This makes it clear that the model is actually indicating
        it cannot make the determination, rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but explicitly indicates it
        cannot determine the locations or make the comparison ("we cannot definitively
        say which facility is east of the other"). The model also states it lacks
        sufficient information. This makes it a case where the model indicates it

      explanation_equal_values: While the response is somewhat garbled with typos,
        it does not state that the locations are equal/identical/the same. Instead,
        it explains that East Rockaway Inlet would not be east of Queensboro CC Medical
        Arts Bldg due to their relative positions within Queens' geography, with one
        being in the southern part near the eastern boundary and the other in the
        northeastern part. The NO is based on relative positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "So, considering

        East Rockaway Inlet is "south and possibly slightly east" of the other location,
        and the NO answer appears to be based on the fact that it's not "directly
        east" rather than any equality of position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that East Rockaway Inlet is
        southeastern relative to where the medical building would be, and the NO appears
        to be based on this directional difference (that it's southeast rather than
        directly east). The model discusses complexity in defining "east" but never
        states the locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response after its analysis, making this a clear NO answer. While the
        model discusses complexity and uncertainty in its reasoning, it does ultimately
        provide a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        is "in the northeastern part" and concludes the inlet is "not east of the
        medical building; rather, it's more to the south and potentially west." The
