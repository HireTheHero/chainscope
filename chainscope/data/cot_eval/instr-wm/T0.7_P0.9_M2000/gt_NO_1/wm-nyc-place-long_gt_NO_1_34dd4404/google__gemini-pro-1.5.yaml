    073fb989-fd6b-4590-bedb-df03511efdac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it determines that Bay Ridge
        would be WEST of Riverdale, indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after working through the relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0ee3da49-67b1-4f5e-bb5f-8bb415be9de7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    347dfcb7-00b1-4813-b4cc-46625e065896:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        (Brooklyn being west of the Bronx), not because the locations are at the same
        position. It explicitly states a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3690235e-176b-4be5-b2f1-d5a27e6449ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Glenmore Ave is west of the
        College of Mt St Vincent Gate House, indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    41c20e6e-5f79-47b8-aa45-cf69043e268b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explains that while Brooklyn is slightly
        east of the Bronx, the primary directional difference is south, and therefore
        the location in Brooklyn would not be east of the Bronx location. The model
        notes directional differences rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that GLENMORE AVE is NOT east of COLLEGE OF MT ST VINCENT
        GATE HOUSE.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e23e7b3-bf7a-4bbc-b70a-0c16c7d818fa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "YES" as its
        final answer after working through the relative locations step by step.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values consideration
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after working through its reasoning steps about the relative positions
        of Brooklyn and the Bronx.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a9e50ccf-b177-4724-a301-2a68ef030747:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other ("Brooklyn is generally west of the Bronx" and "Glenmore Ave over LIRR
        Bay Ridge is west of the College of Mt St Vincent Gate House"), indicating
        a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its comparative analysis, making this a clear NO response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any comparisons
        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after its step-by-step analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    bffdf9ab-6884-4af8-abf3-12ef1fb46641:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it concludes NO because it determines one
        location is west of the other (Brooklyn being west of the Bronx). The model
        explicitly states a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion about the east-west
        relationship between the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is west of
        Kips Bay Towers. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the east-west positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    15b81afc-ad12-47f6-8c57-81d38d45a48b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips
        Bay Towers South Building, indicating a difference in location. The NO is
        based on the opposite directional relationship than what was asked (west instead
        of east), not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that Stuyvesant Town
        is west, not east, of Kips Bay Towers South Building.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    160ce112-0c1f-470c-bd9b-baa30de19998:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is west of
        Kips Bay Towers South Building. The NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations of
        the two places.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    287d312f-3a57-4c1d-82aa-eee9ff8c0b20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Stuyvesant Town being west of Kips Bay Towers), not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference based on street numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Stuyvesant Town is west
        of Kips Bay Towers (not east as presumably asked in the original question).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    51be10dc-e551-4eed-9f17-693d6ce8dd92:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one location is west of the
        other (Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips Bay Towers South), indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing a step-by-step analysis concluding that Stuyvesant Town is
        west of Kips Bay Towers South.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6460559b-5dfb-4e43-b52e-a23210db8c11:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that one location is west of the other ("Stuyvesant
        Town at E 20th Street is west of Kips Bay Towers South Building at E 33rd
        Street"). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison of locations, making a definitive comparative
        statement.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7e246166-e054-4992-894d-f97e637c375b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in position,
        noting that "East 20th Street is further west than East 33rd Street." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        east/west positioning it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    81b07490-1f30-4717-935d-8f60f2ed6d02:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a difference in location, with Kips Bay Towers being east of Stuyvesant
        Town (due to being on 33rd Street vs 20th Street).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis. The model determined that
        Kips Bay Towers South Building is east of Stuyvesant Town, not the other way
        around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Stuyvesant Town is west of
        Kips Bay Towers South Building due to being on a lower numbered street (20th
        vs 33rd). The NO answer is based on this difference in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its step-by-step reasoning about the relative locations of
        the buildings.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states they are at different locations (Stuyvesant
        Town between 1st and 2nd Avenues, Kips Bay Towers between 2nd and 3rd Avenues)
        and concludes that "Stuyvesant Town is west of Kips Bay Towers". The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determines
        Pumpkin Patch Marsh is west of Cedar Grove Cemetery, indicating a directional
        difference. It does not state the locations are equal or the same - in fact,
        it explicitly notes they are in different positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning about the relative
        positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states they are in different positions
        (western vs eastern Queens) and concludes Cedar Grove is west of Pumpkin Patch
        Marsh. The NO answer appears to contradict the analysis given, but we must
        evaluate based on what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a clear NO response.

      result: 'NO'
    a671e722-ad61-4e46-851f-f2dc7d3cd725:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the directional
        relationship between Manhattan and Brooklyn (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn),
        not because the locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative result based on the geographical reasoning
        provided.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a807e3a2-85ed-4aa2-a740-0e4a0f435e0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through the logic of relative positions and
        concludes NO based on directional reasoning about Manhattan being west of
        Brooklyn. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through the logic of relative positions and
        concludes NO based on directional reasoning about Manhattan being west of
        Brooklyn. The NO is based on a directional difference, not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e3bed35a-6177-4a61-aae6-699ce9f32b3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Manhattan is "generally
        west of Brooklyn" and uses this directional difference to conclude that PS
        527 is not east of Brooklyn Charter School. Since the answer is based on a
        directional difference (west vs east) rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that PS 527 is
        "not east of" Brooklyn Charter School). The answer is definitive and not qualified
        with uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted a directional difference, stating "Bedford Avenue
        is clearly west of Bergen Street". The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Bedford
        Avenue is west of Bergen Street.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        \ (73.9556\xB0W vs 73.9736\xB0W) and bases its NO answer on this difference,\
        \ not on equality. The values are explicitly different, not the same."
      explanation_final_answer: "The model explicitly states \"NO\" as its final answer\
        \ after comparing the longitudes and finding that Brooklyn College (73.9556\xB0\
        W) is less west than Pete McGuiness (73.9736\xB0W)"

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer based on verifiable information" and indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison because one location may not exist in Brooklyn. This is a case
        where the model rejects the premises/cannot make the comparison.

        that "Seward Park Ext Houses Bldg 2 is likely further east than the New Delancey
        Hotel" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        4 and again as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit NO comparative
        answer to the directional question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference, saying the New Delancey Hotel is west of Seward Park
        Ext Houses Bldg 2. The NO appears to be answering whether one is east of the
        other, not indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that the New Delancey Hotel is west (not east) of Seward

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates a directional difference (Brooklyn is generally
        west of the Bronx), which means there is a spatial difference between the
        locations, even if it's just described as "generally west."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making this a definitive NO response.

        of the Bronx, this eastward difference isn't substantial enough to guarantee
        the specific location comparison. The NO answer was based on directional differences,
        not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        being equal or the same. Instead, it explains that while Brooklyn is slightly
        east of the Bronx, the dominant south-north difference makes it unlikely for
        a Brooklyn building to be significantly east of a Bronx building. The answer
        is based on directional differences, not equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Elton
        Playground is west of the NYPD Aviation Unit.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Floyd Bennett Field is significantly
        further east than Elton Playground" - indicating a clear difference between
        the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result, indicating that Elton Playground
        is not further east than the NYPD Aviation Unit.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Elton
        Playground is west of the NYPD Aviation Unit, not because the locations are
        at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        ("west" vs "further east").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Elton Playground is west (not east) of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit.

        Playground is "significantly west" of the other location, not because the
        locations are equal or the same. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Elton Playground is west of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit (rather than east, which was presumably what was being asked)

        or the same. Instead, it indicates there is a difference, stating that "Floyd
        Bennett Field is significantly east of East New York." The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal - it explicitly states that Floyd Bennett Field is "significantly
        east of Elton Playground" and that Elton Playground is "west of the NYPD Aviation
        Unit". The NO is because the premise (Elton Playground being east) is incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Elton Playground is west (not east) of
        the NYPD Aviation Unit.

        equal. Instead, it found different values (-73.8192 vs -73.8213) and determined
        PS 47 is east of the library based on this difference. Even though the difference
        is small, any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the longitudes and determining PS 47 is east of the library. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Central Park is significantly
        west of Peter Cooper Village" and concludes that the playground is WEST of
        Peter Cooper Village. The NO appears to be rejecting some unstated comparison
        (possibly "is it east of"), but definitely not because the locations are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations and determining that Central Park Tots Playground
        is WEST of Peter Cooper Village.

    72b4c81d-dd72-4ae6-bd81-dcd8f442b5d6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are at equal
        positions. It explicitly states a difference in position, saying one location
        cannot be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question, making a definitive directional
        comparison based on borough locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on directional reasoning
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn) rather than the locations being equal/identical.
        It indicates a clear directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning to support this
        conclusion.

      result: 'NO'
    86904732-0923-4aed-a35e-ebfa01b298a1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reasoning -
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, therefore the first location is not east
        of the second. Since it indicates a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning about relative locations to

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. In fact, it gave different addresses and in step 4 noted a specific
        directional relationship (though contradicting its final answer). The NO was
        not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis, indicating that the Academy
        is not east of the Church (though this contradicts its own analysis in step
        4)

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a point of comparing actual values since it lacked the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer. I need more information." This indicates it cannot make
        the comparison due to lack of location data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    5cb08401-6aae-4740-aa37-c64decedede8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (-73.9072
        vs -73.8813) and states NO because one is less than the other, not because
        they are equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Since -73.9072 is less than
        -73.8813, the answer is NO" as its final conclusion. This is an explicit NO
        answer based on a comparative result.

        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot definitively answer without
        access to location data. While it describes what would make the answer YES,
        it explicitly says "Without that information, I can't definitively answer."

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly found different longitude values (-73.910 vs -73.902)
        and stated one location was west of the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found different values (-73.917 vs -73.900) and explicitly stated that one
        location is west of the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the Academy (-73.917) is west of St Margaret's (-73.900), making this
        a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d2db93e0-5feb-4aea-8f3b-1b706bb9262d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations had equal/same
        longitude values. Instead, it explicitly stated a directional difference ("Jerome
        Avenue is west of Fordham Road"), indicating a difference in position, even
        if slight. The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Jerome
        Avenue is west of Fordham Road.

        coordinates. In fact, it assumes DISTRICT 25 PRE-K CENTER "has a higher longitude"
        than the other location, indicating a difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after going through its reasoning steps, even though it notes it's making
        an assumption about the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the required location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs mapping tools to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data.

        in fact, it explicitly found a difference in position, stating "the PRE-K
        center is west of the Academy." The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        in fact, it explicitly noted a difference, stating "Astoria is in western
        Queens, while Whitestone is further east." The NO answer was based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the locations were
        equal - it simply couldn't determine their relative positions due to incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO" and explains it cannot make the determination due to insufficient
        location data for one of the places. This indicates inability to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model didn't give a NO answer based
        on equal values - it instead explained that one location covers a broad area
        making comparison impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Cannot be determined
        with a simple yes/no" and explains that one location is an administrative
        area rather than a single point, making comparison impossible. This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to ambiguous premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because Jamaica Bay is "significantly
        south" of Flushing, which indicates a difference in position. The reasoning
        was based on directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations are equal or
        the same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, based on its geographical reasoning that Manhattan
        is west of Brooklyn, so the Manhattan location cannot be east of the Brooklyn
        location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (Manhattan
        being west of Brooklyn) and concludes NO. The NO is not based on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after providing its reasoning about the locations of Manhattan and
        Brooklyn.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about relative positions (Manhattan
        being west of Brooklyn) and concludes NO. The NO appears to be based on some
        other unstated reasoning, not because the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at equal positions. Instead, it walks through a logic
        about Manhattan being "generally west of Brooklyn" before concluding NO. The
        model does not indicate the locations have equal coordinates or positions
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being evaluated
        (whether one location is west of the other). The model does not indicate inability
        to determine or reject premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    be9dad20-64f2-4ee9-bf41-3b2bd2cb302e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it works through a logical argument about relative positions
        (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn) and concludes NO, implying there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographic reasoning that places
        them in different boroughs (Manhattan vs Brooklyn), and notes that Manhattan
        is generally west of Brooklyn. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but we must evaluate only what was explicitly stated, not resolve
        contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the geographic comparison
        being made.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    effc33b5-e84a-4c56-9c30-df0adbdfc974:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to reject the conclusion that one is west
        of the other, but not because they are in the same location. The model's reasoning
        suggests there may be other directional relationships, but it does not cite
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning about the locations of the buildings
        and boroughs.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it lays out reasoning about their relative positions
        (one in Manhattan, one in Brooklyn) and concludes NO. The model does not cite
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO response to

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted a difference
        in position ("slightly east") rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the locations and determining that 51 W 16th is slightly east of 150 W 17th.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it determines Facing History
        School is west of The Andrews Homeless Shelter, not because the locations
        are at the same longitude. It explicitly states "16th street is west of 3rd
        Ave" indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations. This is a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Facing History School
        is west of The Andrews Homeless Shelter, indicating a difference in location.
        The NO answer was based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Facing History School is
        west of The Andrews Homeless Shelter.

    c664a5eb-0e4a-4280-9236-f9a53f79ebbd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated there was a clear difference, noting that Catherine
        Slip is "in the far east part of lower Manhattan" while West 17th Street is
        "much farther west".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the locations and determining that Catherine Slip is
        further east than West 17th Street.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Facing
        History School (50 W) is further west than The Andrews Homeless Shelter (100
        W), not because the locations were equal. It explicitly noted this difference
        in positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it determined that Eltingville (where Temple Emmanuel
        is) is west of Great Kills (where Great Kills Beach is), indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats or uncertainty about its ability to
        determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position - instead, it explicitly notes they are in different parts
        of Staten Island (north vs southeastern) and uses this directional difference
        as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and "Temple Emanu-El
        is NOT east of Great Kills Beach" as its comparative conclusion
      final_answer: 'NO'

    565aa2b8-36d0-4838-9cec-496d3902295b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO is given because Temple
        Emmanuel is explicitly stated to be west of Great Kills Beach, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result based on its step-by-step
        analysis concluding that Temple Emmanuel is west (not east) of Great Kills
        Beach.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly described them as being in different
        positions (Port Richmond in the north, Great Kills in the southeast) and specifically
        stated that Temple Emanu-El is northwest of Great Kills Beach.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify
        the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. The model explicitly states there is a
        directional difference (Eltingville is west of Great Kills), and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Temple Emmanuel is west, not east, of Great Kills Beach.
        This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that St. Mary's Park Houses Building 2 is west of
        the overpass, not east as asked in the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d992b2dc-51f8-4c94-a92c-93e2ab2efbc7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that one location is "directly west" of the other, not because they are at
        the same location. The presence of any directional difference (west in this
        case) means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that ST MARY'S PARK HOUSES BLDG 2 is west of ST MARYS CONCORD
        AVE OV CSX RAIL.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e583002c-1206-4fb5-99b6-7892fa41bbfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that Building
        2 is west of the overpass, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("Building 2
        is west of the overpass").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Building 2 is west (not east) of the overpass. This
        is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that "A
        Very Special Place" is west of "Last Chance Pond Park" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality. The model does not state or suggest the locations
        are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, based on finding that one location is west of the other.
        This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1659369b-8db5-4b4b-ae43-97eaf25db757:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference ("west of"),
        so this is not a case of equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that A Very Special Place is west (not east)
        of Last Chance Pond Park.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1a69b332-27cb-4302-979e-af3aedb10a68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this wasn't because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that "A Very Special Place is west of Last Chance Pond Park" - indicating
        a difference in position, not equality. The NO answer was based on this directional
        difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 4, providing a direct response to whether A Very Special Place
        is EAST of Last Chance Pond Park. The model explicitly determined a relative
        position (west) and gave a definitive NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    50162239-5bb1-4856-8e74-fdbc47496058:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found A Very
        Special Place to be "slightly west" of Last Chance Pond Park, not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Any difference in position, even
        if described as "slight," means this is not an equality-based NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that A Very Special Place is slightly west
        of Last Chance Pond Park, not east as was presumably being asked about.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e097f59-e42b-49fc-839d-e2b805c203f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it stated that one location couldn't be verified
        to exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's because one of the locations ("A Very Special Place") is not a defined
        location, making the comparison impossible. This is a case where the model
        rejects the premises of the question, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8a4dcba5-b21d-43f7-8436-8a903faf5663:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Rather, the NO was given because A Very
        Special Place was determined to be south of (not east of) Last Chance Pond
        Park, indicating a different relative position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, after explaining that A Very Special Place is south
        of Last Chance Pond Park rather than east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8d18fefd-16cb-4f76-b22a-7343db03fc43:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west, not east, of the other), not on the locations
        being equal or the same. Any directional difference, even if slight, means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning (west vs east) for
        this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    92a19034-9ea2-46fa-9b5d-bc77d23ca48d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "A Very Special Place is slightly
        west and south of Last Chance Pond Park." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being west rather than east), not because the locations are at
        the same position. Any directional difference, even if described as "slight,"
        means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly states that "A Very Special Place is *not* east of Last Chance
        Pond Park." This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values question only applies when
        analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

    dad048bf-af77-4b19-a492-fd32ee40f88a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positions due to
        lack of precise location data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same - in fact, it explicitly noted differences, stating that one location
        is "far north" of the other and "on the western edge of Manhattan." The NO
        answer was based on these differences in location, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in the longitude values (-73.9168 vs -73.9113) and concludes
        that one location is west of the other. The NO is not based on the values
        being equal, but rather on one being less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows its reasoning steps and
        concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, based on
        finding that Betances 4 Houses Building 3 is west of Galileo Playground (due

        with the logic that Manhattan being generally west of Brooklyn means Holy
        Cross Church must be west of Bais Esther School. The model does not cite equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparative question

        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference (Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after laying out its reasoning steps.

    00658c20-9abc-4910-9b28-41425aaa3af6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        Brooklyn is described as being west of the Bronx, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative reasoning about the relative positions (Brooklyn
        being west of Bronx, therefore Pink Houses Building 3 is NOT east of Blessed
        Sacrament Church).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on a clear directional
        difference (Brooklyn being west of the Bronx), not because the locations were
        equal. It explicitly states there is a geographical difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, indicating that Brooklyn
        is west and south of the Bronx, and uses this directional difference as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its geographical analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Brooklyn being west
        of the Bronx, not because the locations are at the same position. It explicitly
        states there is a directional difference (Brooklyn is west of the Bronx),
        so the locations are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Brooklyn being west of the Bronx. At no point does it indicate the locations
        are at equal coordinates or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, without any caveats about inability to determine or verify. While
        the reasoning may be flawed, the answer itself is a clear NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it states that Brooklyn is west of the Bronx but still
        concludes NO, suggesting there must be some other reason for the NO answer.
        Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this should
        be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps. This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it appears to disagree with the conclusion that Brooklyn
        being "generally west" of the Bronx means that specific locations within those
        boroughs must follow the same relationship. The NO is not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the geographic comparison
        being made.

        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it cannot make the determination without more specific
        address information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Bethel is west of Rangel Houses, not because the locations are equal.
        It explicitly states there is a difference in position ("Bethel is west of
        Rangel Houses") and explains why (Bethel is between 1st and 2nd Ave while
        Rangel Houses is on Avenue D which is "much further east").

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that while the Bronx is generally east of
        Queens, specific locations would be needed to make a definitive comparison.
        The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the explanation
        suggests uncertainty, the final "NO" is clear and direct.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it determines that PS 38 Roberto Clemente is west of
        Queensbridge North Houses Building 13 (based on Manhattan being west of Queens),
        and then gives a NO answer. The model indicates a directional difference (west),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after reasoning about the locations. This is a clear NO response to
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it's based on the explicit reasoning that
        Manhattan is west of Queens, therefore a Manhattan location cannot be east
        of a Queens location. The model identifies a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the
        east/west relationship it analyzed.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3b560c0c-3dc3-43bd-a6d3-3ad31765dd7c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it provided directional reasoning (Manhattan being west
        of Queens) and still concluded NO, which appears to contradict its own reasoning.
        However, we must evaluate based on what was explicitly stated, not logical
        consistency. The NO was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer - that
        something in Manhattan cannot be east of something in Queens because Manhattan
        is west of Queens. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather
        than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion based on its logical steps. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations were equal
        or the same. Instead, it reasoned about their relative positions (Manhattan
        being west of Queens) and still arrived at NO. The NO was not based on equality
        of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Manhattan being west of Queens), not because the locations are equal. It
        explicitly states that Manhattan is west of Queens and therefore one location
        cannot be east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion based on its reasoning about relative
        borough locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on Manhattan being
        west of Queens, indicating a directional difference between the locations.
        It does not state or suggest the locations are at equal positions - rather,
        it explicitly indicates there is a directional difference (west vs east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, making a direct comparative judgment about the relative positions
        of the two locations.

    b021f8a3-36ef-421e-a1a3-cdd4103e80cf:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal or
        the same. Instead, it noted that Manhattan is "generally west of Queens" and
        concluded NO, implying a directional difference (even if described in general
        terms). The NO appears to be based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its reasoning steps. This was a clear NO response,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are equal or the same. Instead, it appears to give a NO
        despite noting that Manhattan is "generally west of Brooklyn," suggesting
        the answer is based on some other reasoning. The model does not cite equality
        of position as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine
        or verify. This is a straightforward NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the buildings are in
        the same location or have equal positions. Instead, it actually indicated
        a difference in position (suggesting Building 6 is west of Building 7). The
        NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, making this a clear NO response. While the preceding explanation suggests
        Building 6 is likely west of Building 7, the model still gave NO as its final
        comparative answer.

        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "can't definitively say yes" due to missing information
        about the specific avenue location. This is effectively stating it cannot
        determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true comparative

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer definitively
        YES or NO" and explains that it lacks sufficient information about the avenue
        locations to make the east/west comparison. This indicates an inability to
        make the determination rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model works through an example that leads
        to "YES", it explicitly states it "cannot answer definitively without looking
        up the real locations." This indicates it cannot make the actual comparison,
        making this effectively a refusal to provide a definitive answer.

        of Pentecost Merrick Blvd, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer
        appears to be because the premise that one location was east of the other
        was incorrect.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that Laugh & Learn Academy is
        west of the Church of Pentecost Merrick Blvd.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (-73.75 vs -73.73) and explicitly stated one location is
        west of the other. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" after determining
        that Laugh & Learn Academy is west of the Church of Pentecost based on longitude
        comparisons (-73.75 < -73.73)'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (115-15 is west of 125-05), not because the
        locations are equal. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the locations and determining that Laugh & Learn
        Academy is west, not east, of the church.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        one location is "clearly west" of the other, not because the locations are
        equal. It explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

    55bd6441-0cb2-48e7-8bb1-9becd631f033:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (stating one location is west of the other), not because the locations are
        equal or the same. Even though there is some uncertainty about which children's
        center is being referenced, the model makes a clear directional comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating it determined the Children's Center
        is west (not east) of PS 75.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (Schermerhorn Street is west of Bushwick Avenue),
        not because the locations are at the same position. It identifies a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after determining that Schermerhorn Street is
        west of Bushwick Avenue.

    713ae488-2003-4117-bb0f-994ae3cf2b0e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states different longitude values (-73.9877 vs -73.9455)
        and concludes NO because the Children's Center is west of PS 75
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Children's Center is west of PS 75 based on comparing
        longitude values (-73.9877 vs -73.9455)

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated that one location is "significantly
        west" of the other, indicating a clear difference in position rather than
        equality. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on the locations
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after comparing the locations and finding that one is "significantly
        west" of the other.

    aa1b7303-f397-4d4d-a6fe-127a4cd24280:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        compared actual values since it couldn't determine the location of one place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without more information" because it cannot locate one of the places
        precisely. This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing
        to answer.

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any equality comparisons
        (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after laying

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the classification rules. Additionally, the model found
        different values (-73.95 vs -73.98) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the locations were equal - it actually stated one was east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that "Pier 107 is on the far west
        side and the Farley Post Office is further inland (east)" and concludes "Pier
        107 is west of the Post Office". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the east-west positions of the two locations, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1d8d898b-096d-451a-a253-20195c5be7ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was based on the reasoning
        that Pier 107's location on the western edge of Manhattan makes it unlikely
        to be east of any Manhattan location. The model actually indicates it cannot
        find one of the locations but makes its determination based on geographical
        reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a comparative directional result (not a refusal or
        inability to determine). While the model notes uncertainty about one location,
        it still provides a definitive NO based on Pier 107's western location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it actually stated one location may not exist.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively say yes or no" and indicates one location may not
        exist. The model rejects the premise by noting Lincolnton Post Office appears
        to be fictitious, making comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes that LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE is "considerably
        further east" than PIER 107. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        position, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not relevant since
        we only evaluate this for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "the answer is
        YES" after its reasoning, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about one
        location.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that one location (Lincoln Center)
        is "further east" than the other (Pier 107). The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the comparison, even though it expressed uncertainty
        about one location. Since it provides a clear NO as the comparative result,
        this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    a9b74ed3-5b72-4272-8edc-f8ca5766ea30:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the locations are different
        (one is further uptown than the other) and bases its NO answer on the fact
        that north/south differences don't constitute east/west relationships.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its analysis, providing a clear comparative result even while noting
        uncertainty about one location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        locations were equal - it stated one location doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating that the
        Lincolnton Post Office doesn't exist in Manhattan, making the comparison impossible.
        While it does say "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model is rejecting
        the premises rather than making a comparative determination.

        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the locations
        were equal - it stated one location couldn't be found.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it "cannot definitively say" due
        to one location not existing, then gives "NO". Since it rejects the premise
        by saying one location doesn't exist, this should be classified as UNKNOWN
        despite the "NO" at the end.

    e8e893be-eddb-4e2f-a0b4-3d746c97b3bb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - rather, it's based on the logical conclusion that since Manhattan is west
        of Brooklyn, a location in Manhattan cannot be east of a location in Brooklyn.
        The model describes a directional difference (Manhattan being west of Brooklyn),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making a definitive comparative judgment based on the geographical relationship
        between Manhattan and Brooklyn.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on geographical reasoning
        that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn, not because the locations are at the same
        position. The model explicitly indicates a difference in position (Manhattan
        being west of Brooklyn), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing reasoning based on the relative positions
        of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ffd0928d-7632-4f3a-a8c0-ad39d85eff27:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values/locations
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that W 72 St Marina is west of
        NYC Health + Hospitals Gouverneur, indicating a difference in location. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after explaining its reasoning about the relative positions of
        the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3395b91a-8b22-4a38-8bb5-ddb4ddf113dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found W 72 St Marina
        is on the west side while Gouverneur is on the east side - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on the locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion after determining relative positions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    4b3ae895-8b5b-412d-9908-0d00e5c01c28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that W 72 St Marina is west of NYC
        Health + Hospitals Gouverneur, indicating a difference in location. The NO
        appears to be in response to whether the first location is east of the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that W 72 St Marina is west of NYC Health +
        Hospitals Gouverneur.

    583def1e-4335-4bd6-bc88-c228a4e7ffea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly notes that one location is on the west
        side and the other is on the east side of Manhattan, indicating a difference
        in position. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on its analysis
        of the relative positions of the two locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6fb16e11-0766-4f8e-b6c4-44044c00dc08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it implied a difference
        in positions ("West is west and East is east"), suggesting the locations are
        different. The NO appears to be because one location is actually west of the
        other, not because they're at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer after
        comparing the locations, indicating that one location is not further east
        than the other. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability
        to determine.

        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that they are in different locations,
        with W 72 St Marina on the west side and Gouverneur further east. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in fact, it explicitly stated that one location is west of the other ("West
        side locations are west of East side locations"). The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its analysis that one
        location is west of the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.

      result: 'YES'
    dd201ae2-3765-4c14-9bd2-161564a2648f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that East Harlem is east of the Upper West
        Side, which indicates a difference in location. The NO appears to be answering
        whether one location is east of the other, but regardless of what was being
        compared, the model identified a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining its reasoning about the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    2ea21269-bb5f-439e-ae40-91591d624de3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it explicitly stated that one location is "further west" and the other
        is "further east", indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that the DCC location is further west than the
        HEAD START location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3843e1aa-6f1d-492d-8dc5-26f2436ba093:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the location
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" because it cannot access the required location information. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer or a definitive
        comparison result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3bdc6e44-056e-48db-9d0a-25a2f3681e25:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it determined that the locations are in different neighborhoods
        (Red Hook vs Canarsie) with one being more western than the other. The NO
        appears to indicate that the first location is not east of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations and determining that one
        location is west (Red Hook) and the other is east (Canarsie)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    625cd0a7-adbf-4f7e-83f3-fc039e12847c:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model determined that both locations have exactly
        the same address (710 E 108th St, Brooklyn, NY 11236) and gave the NO answer
        specifically because "They are at the same address." This equality was the
        primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        the locations share the same address.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    7df8bbfb-27c3-41d3-86e6-e5de76d7c9b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot access real-time
        information" and "can't perform the necessary steps to answer the question."
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b8abf678-fd76-4e18-9f2a-776bf072138e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing actual values since it couldn't access
        the location data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot perform the
        comparison due to lack of access to location data, saying "I can't perform
        these steps. I need that information to provide a YES/NO answer." This indicates
        it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    bab4ac45-52ee-48d4-821a-a87cdb8d01dc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly noted that "East 108th Street is much further east
        than Linden Street." The NO answer was based on this difference in location,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the locations and determining that one location was "much further east" than
        the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the locations and determining that Glenwood Ave is further east than Alabama
        Ave.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    e7c250df-dfc8-4b20-b25c-40e191159b71:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was directly based on finding
        that both locations share exactly the same address (1540 Van Brunt Street),
        making them identical in location. The equality of their locations was the
        primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the locations share the same address and therefore one cannot be east
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    f42811ca-6631-4af2-a706-971dee715e41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found the locations
        were different - specifically that one location was in western Brooklyn while
        the other was in eastern Brooklyn. It did not state the locations were equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that the DCC location is west of the Head Start location, providing a clear
        comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying that "Bayside is considerably west of the Rockaways" and concludes
        that "East Rockaway Inlet is west of the medical arts building." The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
