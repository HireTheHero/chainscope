      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - instead, it explicitly states that one location is southwest
        of the other, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result that one location is NOT east
        of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the locations being
        in different positions (with one west of the other), not because they are
        equal or the same. The model explicitly states that Central Park Tots Playground
        is WEST of Peter Cooper Village.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Central Park Tots Playground is west (not east) of Peter
        Cooper Village.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal -
        instead, it determined that Central Park Tots Playground must be WEST of Peter
        Cooper Village, indicating a difference in position. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a clear directional difference
        between them. The NO is based on the locations having different positions,
        not being in the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Central Park Tots Playground is west (not east) of Peter Cooper Village.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - it explicitly states that Peter Cooper Village
        is east of 5th Avenue while Central Park Tots Playground is west of it, indicating
        a clear directional difference between the locations
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Central Park Tots Playground
        is NOT east of Peter Cooper Village Building 511"

    f94c58e6-ebb9-4944-9fad-056ce1b225ad:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same - rather, it explicitly states that one location is
        west of the other (indicating a difference in position). The NO is given because
        the relationship is opposite to what was apparently being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the relative
        positions of the locations.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the final answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated differences in position,
        concluding that Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church is "likely further east"
        than Bronx River Houses. The NO appears to indicate that Bronx River Houses
        is NOT east of the church.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the locations' positions, without any caveats
        about inability to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (Bronx River Houses Building 8 is WEST of
        the church).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative directional result, explaining that Bronx River Houses Building
        8 is WEST of the church, not east of it.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3b7d84ac-f01e-4d90-9817-95f54e91e1d7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the locations were equal or the same. Instead, it stated NO because it
        believed one location was west of the other (even though it contradicted its
        own reasoning). Since equality was not given as the reason for the NO answer,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, even though it then contradicts its own reasoning. Since we are instructed
        to take the explicit answer at face value and not resolve contradictions,
        the final answer is clearly NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bronx (where
        Bronx River Houses is) is WEST of Brooklyn (where Ghana Wesley United Methodist
        Church is), indicating a difference in position
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Bronx River
        Houses Building 8 is NOT east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church)" as
        its comparative answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional comparison
        where it determines one location is east of the other (Brooklyn being further
        east than the Bronx). It does not state the locations are equal or the same,
        but rather indicates a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Bronx River
        Houses Building 8 is NOT east of Ghana Wesley United Methodist Church)" which
        is a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        being different (Bronx being west of Brooklyn), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states that one location must
        be west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result based on the geographical analysis
        of the two locations' positions.

    db0ebf0f-7353-4e4a-a3bf-74155df29c51:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO after explaining that one location is
        east of the other ("any point in the eastern Bronx would be east of most points
        in Brooklyn"), indicating a difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "NO" as
        a clear comparative answer after analyzing the geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Bronx location is "slightly
        WEST" of the Brooklyn location, and this difference in position is the reason
        for the NO answer. Even though the difference is described as "slight," any
        stated difference means this is not an equality-based NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its
        final line. This is a direct answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same - it explicitly states that St. Margaret's is
        east of the Academy, indicating a difference in position. The NO appears to
        be rejecting a premise that one was west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that St. Margaret's is east of the Academy, not west.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the NO was given because
        the model determined Holy Trinity is east of District 25 Pre-K Center, indicating
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining why District 25 Pre-K Center
        cannot be east of Holy Trinity Catholic Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different streets (99th vs 143rd) and determining that one
        is west of the other. The NO is not due to the locations being at the same
        position, but rather because they are at different positions with District
        25 being west of Holy Trinity.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that District 25 is west of Holy Trinity, not east of it. This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that the complex is located within the park,
        which is a different spatial relationship than equality. The model identifies
        a specific different spatial arrangement (containment) rather than equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, providing a clear directional conclusion that the complex is not east
        of the park.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it gave NO because it determined the complex
        is contained within the park rather than being east of it - this is a spatial
        relationship difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to determine

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the locations are equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it explained that the Complex is WITHIN the Park, which is
        a different spatial relationship than equality. The NO answer was based on
        this containment relationship, not on the locations being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it wasn't because
        the locations have equal values - rather, it explained that one location is
        contained within the other, making a directional comparison invalid. The reason
        for NO was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Richmond Parkway Malls is "located
        WEST of Ida Court Playground", indicating a difference in position. The NO
        was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference (Richmond Parkway Malls are west of Ida Court Playground). The
        NO is because the direction is opposite to what was apparently asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the relative positions of the

        Richmond Parkway Malls as "south and slightly east" of Ida Court Playground.
        Even though the difference might be small ("slightly"), any stated directional
        difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Richmond Parkway Malls is not east of Ida Court Playground,

        Precinct is west (not east) of Independence Towers Bldg 2. It does not state
        the locations are at equal positions - in fact, it explicitly notes they are
        at different positions with Manhattan being west of Brooklyn. The NO is due
        to directional difference, not equality.

        locations are at different positions (525 West vs 405 West), with one being
        more west than the other. The NO is not due to the locations being at equal
        positions, but rather because one is explicitly west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - FACING HISTORY SCHOOL
        is not east of THE ANDREWS HOMELESS SHELTER. It is west of it." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        the locations were equal/same/identical. Rather, the NO was given because
        the model determined the locations were different (one west, one east) and
        in the opposite direction from what was being asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model concluded NO, it wasn't because the
        locations were equal/identical. Rather, it determined that since both are
        on the West side, neither could be east of the other. This is a different
        logical reason than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        (PS 16 being west of Castle Day Care), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is "slightly to the west" of Castle Day Care, indicating a difference in position,
        even if small. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating PS 16 is not east of Castle
        Day Care. The model provides a definitive directional comparison saying one

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, with PS 16 being "slightly to the west" and Castle Day Care being
        "further east". Even though the difference is described as "slight", any stated
        difference means this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and explicitly

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on the geographical
        relationship between Manhattan and Brooklyn (with Manhattan being west of
        Brooklyn), not because the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly
        states there is a directional difference, with location A being west of location
        B.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that one location is not east
        of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        saying Pink Houses "would be south and slightly east of it." Even though it
        mentions "slightly," any stated directional difference means we cannot classify
        this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        detailed explanation and in the final "Answer: NO" line. This is a clear comparative
        result indicating Pink Houses is not east of Blessed Sacrament Church.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations are "roughly
        aligned" and "at similar longitudinal positions," and uses this approximate
        equality as the basis for its NO answer. The model explicitly states "Neither
        location is significantly east or west of the other" and doesn't indicate
        any directional difference, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" in its final

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are at different positions (with Bethel Church being west of Rangel
        Houses), not because they are at the same location. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Bethel Church of Christ is west of Rangel Houses Building
        4 and therefore cannot be east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the locations were
        equal - it actually stated there was a directional difference, with one location
        being more inland/western than the other. The NO appears to indicate that
        one location is not east of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the relative positions of the two locations, determining that Bethel Church
        of Christ is west of Rangel Houses Building 4.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, saying Bethel Church is WEST of Rangel Houses.
        The NO is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion. This is a direct answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Pier 69 extending
        further east than Skyport Marina. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining
        that Pier 69 extends further east than Skyport Marina. This is a direct comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they are at "approximately
        the same distance from the East River," this equality is not given as the
        primary reason for the NO answer. The main reason for NO is that Skyport Marina
        is north of Pier 69, not east of it. The equal distance is mentioned as supporting
        context but not as the primary reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Skyport Marina is not east of Pier 69
        (they are at the same distance from the river, with one being north of the
        other instead).

        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a difference in position, with the pier extending into the water making
        it "further east than the marina." The NO is based on this directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states that Kingsboro CC is "further
        east" than Macon Library, indicating a difference in location. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (Macon Library being west of Kingsboro CC), not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference with Kingsboro CC being "further east."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations, determining
        that Macon Library is west of Kingsboro CC, not east of it.

        in fact, it explicitly stated that "Luria Academy is actually further east
        than the Flower Garden Pavilion," indicating a difference in position. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the locations are equal/same/identical
        - instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying
        the Pavilion is "slightly WEST" of Luria Academy. Even though the difference
        is described as "slight," any stated difference means this is not an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it as a direct comparative result based on finding that one location

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different positions (Horace Mann School is "far west" while
        Crotona Park is "central"), not because they are equal or the same. The model
        explicitly states there is a directional difference between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations and determining
        that Horace Mann School is west, not east, of Crotona Park.

        being equal - it explicitly states that Horace Mann School is on the "far
        western edge" while Crotona Park is "much further east," indicating a clear
        difference in position. The NO is because one location is west of the other,
        not because they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result that Horace Mann School Spence Cottage
        is not east of Crotona Park - Clinton Playground (in fact stating it is west).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one location is west of the
        other (indicating a difference in position), using the geographical relationship
        between Manhattan and Brooklyn as reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same - rather, it explicitly states they are in different
        positions with W 72 ST MARINA being on the western edge and GOUVERNEUR on
        the eastern side. The NO is based on the locations being in opposite positions,
        not being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result that W 72 ST MARINA is west

        is inappropriate due to the significant latitude difference, not because the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that "The Bronx and Brooklyn
        are roughly aligned on an east-west axis", this is not given as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model's NO is based on inability to determine a clear
        east-west relationship ("isn't a clear 'east of' relationship"), not because
        the locations are at the same longitude. The response indicates uncertainty
        about relative positions rather than equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer and
        reinforces this with "(The church in Brooklyn is not definitively east of
        the Bronx location)". While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative answer rather than refusing to answer
        or stating it cannot determine.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot determine the relative positioning
        without more specific location information. This indicates an inability to
        make the comparison rather than a refusal to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same
        - it explicitly states they are at different addresses (715 vs 905) and concludes
        that one is west of the other. The NO answer is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal/same/identical - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's reasoning for NO is that they are "likely
        in the same building/complex" and therefore "wouldn't be meaningfully east
        of the other." While this implies proximity, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are at exactly/approximately the same location or that equality is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model's logic suggests impossibility of comparison
        due to being in the same complex rather than exact equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (DCC is west of Head Start), not because the locations are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in position based on street
        numbers (715 vs 905).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the DCC is west of the Head Start location, not east.

    b9b0ef28-3553-4e9b-91d0-bfc82f4987ec:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO ANSWER" and explains
        that there isn't enough information to determine the relative positioning.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        or immediately adjacent," it doesn't explicitly state they are at exactly
        the same location as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it makes a directional
        statement that "the DCC is not located east of the Head Start program," implying
        some relative positioning exists.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer" due to lack
        of specific location data. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Inlet is "significantly WEST" of Queensboro CC Medical Arts Building, indicating
        a clear difference in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, East Rockaway Inlet
