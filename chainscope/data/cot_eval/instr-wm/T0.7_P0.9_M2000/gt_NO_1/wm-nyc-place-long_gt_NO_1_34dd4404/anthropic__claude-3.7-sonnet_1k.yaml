      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations are
        equal or the same in terms of their east-west positioning. Instead, it explains
        that both locations are on the western sides of their respective boroughs,
        but it concludes that "the Brooklyn location would not be east of the Bronx
        location." The model is indicating a difference in positioning, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that GLENMORE AVE OVER LIRR BAY RIDGE is not east of COLLEGE OF

        west and south of the Bronx. Therefore, Glenmore Ave in Bay Ridge would be
        located to the west of locations in the Bronx, not to the east."). The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the comparison is inappropriate because one location is in Brooklyn
        and the other is in the Bronx, making it primarily a north/south difference
        rather than east/west. The model is rejecting the comparison based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "LINDEN HOUSES BUILDING

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, the question contains
        a factual error as Passages Academy Belmont is in the Bronx, not Brooklyn."
        This is a rejection of the premise of the question rather than a comparative
        result. The model is stating it cannot make the east-west comparison because
        one location is not in Brooklyn as assumed in the question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that FIT is in Manhattan which
        is west of Brooklyn where JHS 227 is located. The model specifically states
        "FIT would be west of the Brooklyn school" and "it cannot be east of it" -
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.

        are the same or equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model explains that Manhattan is west of Brooklyn,
        and therefore the Manhattan location (FIT) would be west of the Brooklyn location
        (JHS 227), not east. This is a clear directional difference, not an equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Manhattan location would
        be west of the Brooklyn location, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model's reasoning is based on the geographic relationship
        between Manhattan and Brooklyn, where Manhattan is generally west of Brooklyn.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that FIT BUSINESS & LIBERAL ARTS CTR in Manhattan is not east of

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations
        are in different boroughs with Manhattan being west of Brooklyn. The model
        concludes that the Manhattan location is west (not east) of the Brooklyn location,
        indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that FIT BUSINESS & LIBERAL ARTS CTR in Manhattan is

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Academy is located
        west of St. Margaret's Episcopal Church, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The reason for the NO answer is that the Academy
        is west of the Church, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Academy is located east of the Church. The model provides a

        states "they are essentially the same location" and explains that "one cannot
        be east of the other" because they are the same place. The model is clearly

        "The 'Complex' would encompass the 'House Park' rather than being positioned
        to its east or west." This suggests the model believes they are essentially

        while Ida Court Playground is situated more in the central-western part" and
        that "Richmond Parkway is generally south and east of the Heartland Village
        area where Ida Court Playground is located." The model's reasoning actually
        suggests they are in different locations, not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its preceding analysis where it concluded
        "Richmond Parkway Malls would be east of Ida Court Playground." This contradiction
        creates confusion, but since the final explicit answer is "NO" to the question

        equality. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on the
        locations being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Richmond Parkway

        east of Facing History School based on their addresses (405 West vs 525 West,
        with lower "West" numbers being further east). The model is indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality.

        - that the school is on the western side of Manhattan while the shelter is
        on the eastern side. This difference in location is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that the Facing History School is on the western side of
        Manhattan while the Andrews Shelter is on the eastern side, concluding that

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Facing History School
        is west of The Andrews Homeless Shelter, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Facing History School is located between 10th and 11th Avenues while
        The Andrews Shelter is between 9th and 10th Avenues, making the latter east
        of the former.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Facing History School
        is NOT east of The Andrews Homeless Shelter; it's actually west of it)" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        the locations are in opposite positions from what was asked - specifically
        stating that "the school is on the west side of Manhattan while the shelter
        is on the east side" and "the school is west of the shelter." The model identified
        a clear directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the Facing History School is east of the Andrews Homeless Shelter.
        The model clearly concludes that "the school is NOT east of the shelter" and
        reinforces this with "the school is west of the shelter."

        of Great Kills Beach, not east of it. The model is stating there is a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Temple Emmanuel would

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to this question with the information available." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it cannot verify the existence or location of

        (the model stated it cannot determine the answer), this automatically results
        in False for this question according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that 'A VERY SPECIAL PLACE' is east of LAST CHANCE POND PARK because I don't
        have sufficient information about the location called 'A VERY SPECIAL PLACE'
        in Staten Island." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot
        confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information, not that it's making a definitive comparative judgment.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the question. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a reliable YES or NO
        answer to this question as one of the locations cannot be specifically identified
        on a map of Staten Island." The model is indicating it cannot make the comparison
        because it cannot identify one of the locations.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one location doesn't exist as a specific
        place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that "A VERY SPECIAL PLACE" is east of LAST CHANCE POND PARK because it is
        not an identifiable specific location in Staten Island)". This is a case where
        the model is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one of
        the locations doesn't exist as a specific place. The model is saying "NO"
        but immediately qualifying it with an explanation that it cannot make the
        comparison because one location isn't identifiable.

        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it suggests that if "A VERY SPECIAL
        PLACE" refers to Staten Island as a whole, then the answer would be NO because
        "a park cannot be east of the island it's located on." This is not claiming
        equality but rather a containment relationship. The model is giving a different
        reason for its NO answer than the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Jamaica specifically
        is further east than Throggs Neck/Maritime College" and that "Queens as a
        whole lies east of the Bronx." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (Jamaica is further east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that MARITIME COLLEGE REINHART FIELD in the Bronx is

        Park Arthur Ross Nursery is west of PS 7 Abraham Lincoln, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model is asserting that one location
        is west of the other, not that they have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that Van Cortlandt
        Park Arthur Ross Nursery is not east of PS 7 Abraham Lincoln, and in fact
        states the opposite relationship ("Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery
        in the Bronx is actually west of PS 7 Abraham Lincoln in Brooklyn, not east
        of it").

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Van Cortlandt Park
        Arthur Ross Nursery is WEST of PS 7 Abraham Lincoln, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that
        the first location is west of the second, not that they are at the same longitude
        or have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model directly addresses the
        question of whether Van Cortlandt Park Arthur Ross Nursery is east of PS 7
        Abraham Lincoln, and concludes with a definitive "NO" followed by an explanation
        that the first location is west of the second location.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Woodbridge Creek, New
        Jersey is not located east of Conference House, Staten Island. It is located
        to the west." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Woodbridge Creek
        is located to the west of Conference House, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Woodbridge Creek, New
        Jersey is not located east of Conference House, Staten Island. It is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Woodbridge Creek
        is west of Conference House, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Woodbridge Creek must be west of Conference House, not east
        of it, which directly answers the comparative question with a definitive negative.

        are the same. In fact, it explicitly states a difference in location, saying
        that TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66 is "south and east of the synagogue." The
        model is not saying NO because the locations are identical, but because of
        their specific directional relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH
        OPP 66 is not east of Ansche Chesed Synagogue. It is south and east of the
        synagogue." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "the transverse
        is east of the synagogue" and describes their different positions, with one
        being "more centrally located" and the other being "on the west side of Manhattan."
        The model is giving NO as its answer because it determined that the relationship
        is the opposite of what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative question
        about whether one location is east of the other.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that "the
        Transverse Road location is east of the synagogue," indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer appears to be directly responding to the original
        question (likely asking if the first location is west of the second), and
        the model determined there is a directional difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after
        analyzing the locations and determining that the Transverse Road location
        is east of the synagogue.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific directional difference,
        stating that the first location is "actually west of it because the synagogue
        is at West 100th Street, which is further north and east compared to the Transverse
        Road 1 location." The model is claiming a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The statement is
        incorrect." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question of
        whether the first location is east of the second location.

        is further uptown and further west." The model gives a NO answer while acknowledging
        a directional difference, not because the locations are in the same place.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the very end of
        its response, indicating that TRNVS 1WB OV PD PTH OPP 66 is not east of ANSCHE
        CHESED SYNAGOGUE. The model concludes that "the 1 train at 66th Street is

        to whether Smith Houses Building 6 is located east of Smith Houses Building
        7. The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, Smith Houses Building 6
        is NOT located east of Smith Houses Building 7. NO"

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question with the information available to me." The

        or the same. Instead, it provides a specific directional difference, stating
        "It's actually west of it, as Bushwick is further east than Crown Heights
        in Brooklyn's geography." The model is claiming there is a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - The NYC Children's
        Center in Brooklyn is not east of PS 75 Mayda Cortiella." This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to lack of information.

        if the New York City Children's Center is east of PS 75 Mayda Cortiella based
        on the information available to me." This is a case where the model is saying
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, not providing a
        comparative result. The "NO" here means "No, I cannot determine" rather than
        "No, it is not east of."

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO, I cannot provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer to this question as I lack the necessary geographic
        information about these specific Brooklyn locations." This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making
        a comparative judgment. The model is stating it cannot make the determination.

        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that "The NYC Children's Center is not east of PS 75 Mayda
        Cortiella - it's actually southwest of it." This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that PIER 107 is on Manhattan's western edge while
        the post office would be inland, making the pier west (not east) of the post
        office.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "PIER 107 is on Manhattan's western edge, so it cannot

        corrected itself in the final sentence, stating "YES, Pier 107 on the East

        the two facilities "are housed in the same building or complex and occupy
        the same general address, neither would be east of the other - they occupy
        the same location." The model explicitly states they are in the same location,
