    02af0fc0-3070-416d-ba0e-d3f5b5d892ca:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. The model explicitly
        states "Glenmore Ave over LIRR Bay Ridge in Brooklyn is west of the College
        of Mount Saint Vincent Gate House in the Bronx" indicating a directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Glenmore Ave is west of the College of Mount Saint
        Vincent Gate House (when the question asked if it was east). This is a direct
        comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Glenmore Ave
        is west of the college, indicating a clear directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Glenmore Ave is not located east of the College
        of Mount Saint Vincent Gate House. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that Cedar Grove Cemetery is west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer was given because the model determined one location
        was west of the other, not because they were at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative result about the relative locations of the two
        places. The model states that Cedar Grove Cemetery is not east of Pumpkin
        Patch Marsh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal or the same. Instead, the NO was given because the
        model determined there was a different directional relationship (north) rather
        than the asked-about direction (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing directional reasoning that Cedar Grove
        Cemetery is north of, not east of, Pumpkin Patch Marsh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are at the same position. The model explicitly states that Cedar
        Grove Cemetery is "west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh" and describes them as being
        in different positions (one more inland/north, the other more south/east).
        The NO answer was given because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Cedar Grove Cemetery is east of Pumpkin Patch Marsh,
        explaining that Cedar Grove Cemetery is actually west of Pumpkin Patch Marsh.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that PS 527 is west
        of Brooklyn Charter School (even though it's on the East Side of Manhattan,
        it's still west of Brooklyn). The model identifies a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step analysis, making this a straightforward

        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model eventually states "YES" after some discussion,
        though it expresses uncertainty about the premise. Since it does provide an
        explicit YES answer (stating "YES, Linden Houses in East New York is likely
        east"), we should classify this as YES despite the caveats.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is
        west of the Bronx, indicating a difference in position. The NO is based on
        the opposite directional relationship (west instead of east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that LOW HOUSES BUILDING 1 is not east of PS 81 ROBERT
        J CHRISTEN. This is a direct comparative answer to the question asked.

        - it explicitly states that Manhattan/Chelsea lies to the west of Brooklyn/Bensonhurst,
        indicating a clear directional difference ("significantly west"). The NO is
        because FIT is west (not east) of JHS 227, not because they're at the same

        JHS 227, not because the locations are equal. The model explicitly states
        there is a directional difference (FIT is west of Brooklyn/JHS 227), so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        longitude values (73.856 vs 73.895) and explicitly stated that one location
        is west of the other. The NO was not due to equal values, but due to finding
        a difference in the opposite direction from what was asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        the locations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "3177 Webster
        Ave is west of 940 E 156th St," indicating a difference in position. The NO
        answer is based on one location being west of the other, not because they

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different
        (-73.8997 vs -73.9045) and concludes NO because the Academy is actually west
        of the church, not east as asked in the question. The values being compared
        are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without further details or tools" and explains it cannot
        make the comparison without specific addresses. This indicates an inability

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        or suggest that the locations have equal coordinates or positions. In fact,
        it couldn't access the specific location data, but still provided a NO answer
        without indicating equality as the reason. Therefore, equality was not stated
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged limitations in accessing map
        data. Since it provided a clear NO answer rather than stating it couldn't
        determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it couldn't determine their
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer and explicitly
        states it "cannot determine" the relative positions without specific address/coordinate
        data. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate if it was due to equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive
        determination without exact addresses or map references. While it explains
        how one could determine the answer with more information, it does not provide
        a clear YES or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response never
        suggests the locations are equal - it discusses various possible relative
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        "we can't definitively say yes or no" and only provides the NO answer based
        on an assumption ("if we assume"). This indicates uncertainty about the actual
        comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        - it explicitly states that one location is east of the other (Whitestone
        is "further east than Flushing"). The NO answer appears to be based on the
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, making a definitive comparative judgment based
        on geographical positions.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. In fact, it suggests that the District 25 Pre-K Center is likely
        west of Holy Trinity Catholic Academy. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (being west rather than east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty in its reasoning.
        The answer is clearly stated and not qualified with inability to verify or
        determine.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it needs more information to make the determination.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        without additional data.

        relative positions due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "No, we cannot determine this based
        on the information provided" and explains it cannot make the comparison due
        to unclear/insufficient information about one of the locations. This is a
        case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explains it cannot determine the location of one of the places. This is
        effectively stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria
        for UNKNOWN rather than a comparative NO.

        position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we lack sufficient information
        to confirm the statement)". Since this indicates an inability to determine
        the comparison rather than a comparative result, this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN. The model is essentially saying it cannot verify the relationship,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the locations are at the same position or have equal coordinates. The
        model arrives at NO after "checking a map or using geographic data" but doesn't
        indicate equality as the reason. No mention is made of the locations being
        identical or at the same coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Betances

        and they are on the same avenue (Willis Avenue), but it does not explicitly
        state they are at the same east-west position as the reason for its NO answer.
        Even if this might be implied by being on the same avenue, we must go by explicit
        statements only.

        Even though this is the basis for the NO answer (since the question asked
        if one was east of the other), the locations are described as different, not
        equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other (indicating different positions), not because
        they are at the same location. The model explicitly states "Stapleton is generally
        located to the east of New Brighton" and concludes PS 16 is "west of" Castle
        Day Care.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that PS 16 is west (not east) of Castle Day Care. This

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found PS 16
        is "located to the west of Castle Day Care," not because the locations are
        equal. It identified a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, indicating PS 16 John J Driscoll is west (not
        east) of Castle Day Care.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference - that PS 16 is located to the west of Castle Day Care, which is
        why it's not east of it. Even if this difference might be small (which isn't
        specified), any stated directional difference means this isn't an equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: NO" and
        clearly indicates that PS 16 John J Driscoll is not located east of Castle

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that PS
        16 is "further west" compared to Castle Day Care, not because the locations
        are equal. It explicitly states a directional difference, so this is not a
        case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" after determining
        that PS 16 is west of Castle Day Care, not east as asked in the question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that one location
        is west of the other (specifically that the Brooklyn location is west of the
        Bronx location). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer to the question
        is NO" as its final conclusion after its step-by-step analysis.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Brooklyn is southwest of the
        Bronx and concludes NO based on this directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on Brooklyn being west of the Bronx, not because the locations are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion, based on its geographical analysis comparing
        the two locations.

      result: 'NO'
    a8dc385e-b8dc-4319-be70-7f674a60d7eb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is southwest of the other), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly states that Brooklyn is "to the south and
        slightly to the west of the Bronx" and concludes that Fermi Playground is
        west of River Ave.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations and determining that Fermi Playground
        is west (not east) of River Ave.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines Brooklyn is southwest
        of the Bronx, indicating a directional difference between the locations. The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion, providing a direct comparative answer based on its geographical
        analysis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on determining that
        the locations are in different positions (Brooklyn being west of the Bronx),
        not because they are equal or the same. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that Brooklyn is west of the Bronx, and therefore the location
        in Brooklyn must be west of the location in the Bronx. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, concluding that Brooklyn is "generally southwest of the Bronx"
        and therefore the first location "cannot be east" of the second location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion, based on its geographic analysis comparing the locations.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1accc5c6-90cb-463d-bd1a-1e7164a5a15b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the answer is NO, it's not because the locations
        are equal/same. The model explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        with Holy Cross Church being on the west side of Manhattan and Bais Esther
        School being "further east." The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" and explains that Holy Cross Church is not east of Bais Esther School,
        providing a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2e9e1a5c-cc12-4978-a311-06c9a05016cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same - rather, it explicitly states that Manhattan (where Holy
        Cross Church is) lies west of Brooklyn (where Bais Esther School is). The
        NO answer is based on this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Holy Cross Church is east of Bais Esther School, based
        on its geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    563b4577-9224-4720-a270-64d8e32c3b17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the locations
        are equal/same - it explicitly states that Holy Cross Church is west of Bais
        Esther School, indicating a difference in position. The NO is because the
        relationship is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Holy Cross Church
        is not located east of Bais Esther School; it is located west." This is a
        clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that Holy Cross
        Church is "west of Bais Esther School" - indicating a difference in position,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because the first location is west of
        the second, not because they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical positions and concluding that Holy Cross
        Church is west (not east) of Bais Esther School.

        results in False, regardless of any comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, though there appears to be an internal
        contradiction with its previous statement about Holy Cross Church being "west
        of Bais Esther School."

        being equal - it explicitly states that Holy Cross Church is west of Bais
        Esther School, indicating a clear directional difference between their positions.
        The model describes Holy Cross Church as "further west" and Bais Esther School
        as "further east" relative to each other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the locations, indicating that Holy Cross
        Church is not east of Bais Esther School (it's actually west of it).

        indicating a directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the 11 AVE VIADUCT
        OV LIRR W SD YD, Manhattan is not located east of CHRIST UNITED METHODIST
        CHURCH, Brooklyn" as its final comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found the viaduct is
        west of the church, not because the locations are at the same longitude. It
        explicitly states there is a directional difference ("the viaduct is actually
        west of Christ United Methodist Church")

        or the same. Instead, it provides directional differences, explaining that
        Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx and specifically analyzing the relative
        positions of the neighborhoods. The NO answer is based on these directional
        differences, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its conclusion after

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that Pink Houses
        Building 3 is "to the south and somewhat to the west" of Blessed Sacrament
        Church, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final

        location is west of the other, not because the locations are equal/same/identical.
        The model explicitly states "Brooklyn is to the west/southwest of the Bronx"
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer to
        the question is NO" after determining that Pink Houses Building 3 is west
        of Blessed Sacrament Church, not east. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        Pink Houses Building 3 is west of Blessed Sacrament Church, indicating a directional
        difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Pink Houses Building 3 is west of Blessed Sacrament
        Church. This is an explicit NO answer to whether the first location is east
        of the second.

        was west of the second location ("the Gospel of St. Luke Church in the Bronx
        is likely to be west of Our Lady of Mercy School in Queens"). The NO was based
        on a directional difference, not equality.

        west of PS 49 Willis Ave" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that Sedgwick Houses Building 5 is west of PS 49 Willis
        Ave. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        it "unlikely for one to be definitively east of the other." While this implies
        they are at similar positions, the model does not explicitly state they are
        exactly/approximately equal or identical. The NO appears to be based on the
        inability to determine a difference rather than an explicit statement of equality.

        the same position or equal distance from the east. Instead, it explains that
        while both are on the eastern waterfront, they have different positions (one
        is more north than the other). The NO answer is based on their positions along

        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states they are different (one is
        north of the other). The NO is because they have a different relative position
        (north-south) rather than the east-west relationship being asked about.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Macon
        Library is west of Kingsborough Community College, not because the locations
        are at the same position. The model explicitly states there is a directional
        difference ("west of"), so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" after determining that Macon Library is
        west of Kingsborough Community College, not east as asked in the question.

        the buildings were in the same location - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot verify or determine the answer,
        making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        make a NO comparison based on equal values - it simply declined to make any
        comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a precise YES or NO answer
        cannot be given" and explains that it needs more data to make a determination.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient
        information.

        NO), this is automatically False. The model never made a comparison of equal
        values, as it stated it couldn't make any determination without a map.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be provided" and does not give a final comparative answer. Instead,
        it explains what would be needed to make the determination (a map) and how
        one could then determine the answer.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a clear
        YES or NO answer without additional specific locational data" and indicates
        it cannot determine the relative positions without a detailed map. This is
        a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the buildings are in the same location or have equal coordinates. In
        fact, it doesn't specify any reason for the NO answer after previously indicating
        uncertainty. Since equality is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer,
        this must be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially indicates uncertainty due to lack
        of map data, but then concludes with an explicit "NO" statement at the end.
        While there is some inconsistency in the reasoning, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" answer at face value.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        layout and mentions needing a map to confirm positions, it does not state
        that the buildings are in the same location or that they have equal positions.
        The NO answer is not justified by stating the buildings are in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, SMITH HOUSES
        BUILDING 6 is not located east of SMITH HOUSES BUILDING 7." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question, despite earlier expressing uncertainty
        about the layout.

        results in False for question 2, regardless of any discussion of equal values
        (which wasn't present in this response anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that St. Andrews Playground Basketball
        Court is located east of Harlem Teams for Self Help.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are equal. It explicitly states
        "8th Avenue is west of Madison Avenue" and concludes the locations have different
        positions. The NO is due to this directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that 14 Street/Canarsie Tube is west of the Pakistan
        Consulate (when asked if it was east). This is an explicit NO as a comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are different (one is west of the other), not because they are equal.
        The model explicitly states that the Canarsie Tube is "further west" than
        the Consulate's location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations, determining that the Canarsie Tube is west
        of (not east of) the Pakistan Consulate.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a directional
        difference (one location being west of the other), not because the locations
        are equal. The model explicitly states "8th Avenue is west of Madison Avenue
        and Fifth Avenue" as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" after determining that the 14th Street/Canarsie Tube is west of the
        Pakistan Consulate. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or equal in any way. Instead, it describes their relative
        positions and concludes NO based on the Canarsie Tube being west of (not equal
        to) the Pakistan Consulate's location. The model specifically notes different
        positions, with one being on 14th Street and the other on 65th Street.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, presented in bold. This is a clear, direct NO answer to
        the comparative question.

        It explicitly states "14 Street/Canarsie Tube is located west of the Pakistan
        Consulate" showing a clear directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the locations and determining that the 14 Street/Canarsie
        Tube is west of the Pakistan Consulate, not east as asked in the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that the Canarsie Tube is "more central
        and to the west" compared to the Consulate's "Upper East Side location". The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, 14 Street/Canarsie
        Tube is not located east of the Pakistan Consulate in Manhattan." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding that the
        locations are in different parts of Manhattan (west vs east), not because
        they are equal/same. It explicitly states that one is west of the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that one
        location is west of the other, not because they are at the same location.
        It explicitly states "14th Street and Union Square are located further downtown
        (south) and to the west relative to the Upper East Side location of the Pakistan
        Consulate."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that
        one location is west of the other, indicating a difference in position. The
        NO is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "115-28 Merrick Blvd is west of 118-02
        Merrick Blvd" - indicating a difference in position, and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clearly indicates that LAUGH & LEARN ACADEMY is not located east
        of the CHURCH OF PENTECOST MERRICK BLVD.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not make any claims about the locations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps for comparison but did not
        actually make a determination or provide a definitive YES/NO answer. Instead,
        it ended with a conditional statement ("if...then") without resolving which
        condition applies.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        also did not make any claims about the locations being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        by saying it cannot verify without specific address verification, making this
        effectively a statement that it cannot determine the answer rather than a
        definitive comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where
        "the model indicates it cannot make the comparison."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values
        were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains the process one would need to follow to determine the
        answer and states that "without specific addresses or map data, I can't provide
        an exact answer." While it mentions that the answer "would be YES" if certain
        conditions are met, it does not actually make that determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that specific addresses/coordinates would be

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and provides only steps for how one could determine the

        the locations are equal - it simply lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it previously states
        "I cannot definitively answer the question" and indicates it lacks the necessary

    3a7dcfd5-05ea-43bc-a6c5-60a1e71b05e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the locations were equal - it actually suggested they would be in different
        positions if certain assumptions were made.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" near the end, it heavily
        qualifies this with assumptions and explicitly states "it's not possible to
        provide a definitive YES or NO answer." The model also indicates both locations
        may be fictional. This rejection of the premises and inability to make a definitive
        comparison classifies as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    40fb8c1e-8d8d-473c-a8b6-b3b5ed39ad05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (pier being west of the post office), not because the locations are at the
        same position. The model explicitly states the pier is on the waterfront while
        the post office is further inland.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, PIER 107 CVII is not
        located east of LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE, Manhattan" as its final answer, providing
        a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7394dd7f-f77c-45ea-8ad2-373c764d0b0a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates that both are on the western side of Manhattan,
        with the pier being "further west along the river." Since it notes a difference
        in position (pier being further west), this cannot be classified as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its analysis, making this a straightforward classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a735db0f-2adf-4f93-91fc-c7bb772b08d4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on relative positions
        (Pier 107 being on the west side and the Post Office likely being east of
        it), not because the locations are at the same position. The model actually
        suggests they are in different positions, with one west and one likely east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with reasoning about relative positions. While there is uncertainty
        in the reasoning, the model does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning.

    bc9f151e-bcea-4096-a1f1-42980ac51110:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the locations were equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Pier 107 would likely be west
        of the Lincolnton Post Office, indicating a directional difference (even if
        based on assumptions).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Thus, the answer
        to the question is: NO" after reasoning about relative positions, making this
        a clear NO answer despite acknowledging uncertainty about exact locations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0cec603-edef-47d0-a83f-320ebb8132e9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, the model explicitly states
        that PIER 107 CVII is "west of the Lincoln Square neighborhood where the Lincolnton
        Post Office is located" - indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether PIER 107 CVII is east of LINCOLNTON POST OFFICE. The
        model provides reasoning and concludes with a definitive "NO" based on its
        analysis that PIER 107 CVII is west of the post office.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ebc51da8-fc0f-4f2b-98ca-34cb536d32b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it indicates they are both "likely on the west side"
        but does not claim they are at the same location or coordinates. The NO answer
        is based on their relative positions, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a comparative result based on its geographical analysis.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Comfort Inn Hotel is west
        of the park, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the Comfort
        Inn Hotel JFK Airport is not located east of Police Officer Edward Byrne Park"
        after providing its analysis. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same in any dimension. Instead, it determines NO based on analyzing
        relative positions and concluding that the Pavilion is not east of the academy.
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a different
        directional relationship (south) rather than finding the locations to be equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a directional difference, with the Pavilion
        being "to the south of Luria Academy of Brooklyn, not to the east."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that the Pavilion is south of the Academy, not east as

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        the same position or have equal coordinates. Instead, it explicitly states
        that the Flower Garden Pavilion is west of Luria Academy, indicating a difference
        in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        in its conclusion, making a definitive comparative statement about the relative
        positions of the two locations.

        or the same. Instead, it specifically indicates there is a directional difference,
        stating the Pavilion is "directly south or slightly west" of the Academy.
        Even though one option is "directly south," the inclusion of "slightly west"
        means there is a stated directional difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a clear comparative result stating that the Pavilion is not east
        of the Academy.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on equal values
        - it explicitly states there is a directional difference (southeast vs east).
        The NO is because the direction is southeast rather than purely east, not
        because the locations are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (it is not
        east, but southeast)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO
        answer based on a directional comparison.

        not because they are in the same location. The model explicitly states there
        is a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Horace Mann School is west (not east) of Crotona Park.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Horace Mann School is northwest
        of Crotona Park, indicating a clear directional difference between the locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Horace Mann School Spence
        Cottage is not located east of Crotona Park - Clinton Playground" as its final
        answer, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the locations were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one location's
        position relative to the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot verify/determine the location of Mall Eighteen.
        This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison,
        which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The question of equal values
        is not relevant since there was no definitive NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states it cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer due to lack of information about MALL EIGHTEEN's location. However,
        it then proceeds to give a conditional "YES" based on assumptions. Since the
        model expresses uncertainty and cannot definitively determine the relative
        positions, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the response is filled with uncertainty ("difficult to assert", "without a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the locations are equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states there
        is a directional difference, concluding that Orchard Beach would be west of
        Duck Creek because the Bronx is west of Queens.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer to the question is NO" as its final comparative conclusion based
        on geographical reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as its reason for
        the NO answer, specifically stating that Orchard Beach would be west of Duck
        Creek. Since the NO is based on a directional difference rather than equality,
        this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after analyzing the relative positions of the two locations. This
        is a direct comparative answer.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference,
        concluding that one location is west of the other ("Since Queens is generally
        to the east of the Bronx, any location in the Bronx would be to the west of
        any location in Queens").
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The final

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal - it explicitly states that Orchard Beach is west of Duck Creek
        in Queens. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality
        of position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on its geographical analysis that
        Orchard Beach is west of Duck Creek.

      result: 'NO'
    f218c2c7-25db-44d5-b2e9-ac1d4eca5673:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (Orchard Beach being west of Duck Creek), not because the locations are at
        the same position. The model explicitly states that one location is west of
        the other, indicating a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Orchard Beach North Men's Comfort Station is not
        located east of Duck Creek." This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the locations were equal - it actually suggested they could
        be in different positions but couldn't determine which.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        provide a clear YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the relative
        positions without map data. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model did not make a NO comparison
        based on equal values - it instead indicated inability to determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm..." which indicates
        inability to determine the relationship rather than a definitive comparative
        result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as it explicitly states it cannot
        verify the relationship without additional data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        response never indicates the locations are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.
        Instead, it explains how one could determine the answer but explicitly states
        "I can't definitively answer the question" and suggests that the reader would
        need to check a map themselves. This indicates inability to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    5cda8cb5-1cba-4f3e-b5aa-09d3fd27c396:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations' positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        provide a YES or NO answer" and explains that specific geographical data would
        be needed to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it explicitly states there is a directional
        difference, saying the garage is "west of" the guard shack. The NO is because
        the direction is opposite to what was asked (west instead of east), not because
        the locations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative result based on its analysis
        that the garage is west of the guard shack (rather than east as asked in the
        question).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the locations were equal - it simply stated it couldn't
        determine their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the relative positions. This is a case
        where the model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of data, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    8ca40384-112f-4813-b9bd-7b7e4b3fead3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the response does not explicitly state the locations
        are equal/same/identical as the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", this NO is qualified
        with "since such facilities tend to not be significantly east or west of one
        another without specific data to confirm otherwise" and the response explicitly
        states "without precise coordinates or a detailed map, a definitive answer
        cannot be given here." This indicates the model cannot make the determination,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the
        first condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive
        YES/NO answer without access to specific geographic data or maps. It does
        not make a comparative determination but rather indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison.

        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the locations at
        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of specific maps or coordinates.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer,
        making it an UNKNOWN response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same/identical. Instead, the model suggested the
        garage was likely west of the guard shack, indicating a difference in position.
        The NO was based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" answer,
        though it qualifies this with words like "likely" and bases it on assumptions.
        Since it provides a clear directional NO answer as its final conclusion (not
        saying it cannot determine), this counts as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a directional difference
        (west vs east), not because the locations are at the same position. The model
        explicitly states one location is on the west side while the other is on the
        east side of Manhattan.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the locations were equal/same. The model explicitly states that PS 371 is
        southwest of the DOE headquarters, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the locations
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "PS 371 Lillian L. Rashkis in
        Brooklyn is located at a longitude that is actually further west compared
        to the Department of Education Headquarters in Manhattan." This indicates
        a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, providing a clear comparative result based
        on its analysis that PS 371 is further west than the DOE Headquarters.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are equal
        or the same - in fact, it explicitly states there is a directional difference
        (PS 371 is west of the DOE HQ). The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the locations are at
        equal longitude. Instead, it gives a directional explanation, indicating that
        Brooklyn is southwest of the Bronx (implying different positions). The NO
        answer is based on relative positioning, not equality of coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical - rather, it states there is a directional difference
        (northeast rather than strictly east). Any directional difference, even if
        slight, means we should classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the locations
        being equal/same/identical. Instead, it explains that the Bronx (where the
        yard is) is "north and slightly to the west of Brooklyn" - indicating a difference
        in position, not equality. The NO is based on the western position, not on
        equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, the MTA Metro-North
        BN Yard in the Bronx is not located east of Howard Houses Building 10 in Brooklyn."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the locations are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a directional difference, saying East
        Rockaway Inlet is "south and slightly west" of the other location. The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        East Rockaway Inlet is "to the south and slightly to the west of Bayside"
        - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is based
        on finding a westward position difference, not because the locations are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after explaining that East Rockaway Inlet is west of the Queensboro CC
        Medical Arts Building. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
