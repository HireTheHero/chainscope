      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in location,
        stating that "Puig Campana is west, not east, of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains."
        The model gives a clear directional difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Puig Campana
        is west, not east, of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Tioga Lake being west of Lac Vieux Desert. The model states
        "California is far to the west of the Michigan/Wisconsin border" and concludes
        that "Tioga Lake is located west, not east, of Lac Vieux Desert." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Tioga Lake

        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values being compared are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "YES"
        at the very end of the response. The model concludes that Tioga Lake is located
        east of Lac Vieux Desert after comparing their longitudes.

        far to the west of Siberia (Asia)." The model is indicating a clear directional
        difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        than equality. The model states "Nepal is a country in South Asia, located
        to the west of Japan" and "Jagdishpur Reservoir in Nepal is geographically
        west of Lake Motosu in Japan."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly states that "High Atlas is significantly to the west
        of Parnon" and compares their locations (Morocco in west North Africa vs Greece
        in Southeastern Europe). The model gives a NO answer because it found a difference
        in location (west vs east), not because the values are the same.

        that Lac Courte Oreilles is located west of Lough Sheelin. The model explicitly
        states "Lac Courte Oreilles is located west of Lough Sheelin" in its conclusion,
        indicating a difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model explicitly states "NO" after providing its reasoning
        about the geographical positions of the two lakes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared

        different, with Pyramid Lake being "geographically far to the west of Cobequid
        Bay." The model's reasoning is that Pyramid Lake is in Western Canada (Alberta)
        while Cobequid Bay is in Eastern Canada (Nova Scotia), making them distinctly
        different in location rather than equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "the statement that Pyramid Lake is east
        of Cobequid Bay is incorrect" and provides "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ahmic Lake is geographically
        west of Cabo da Roca" and explains that "Canada is in North America, which
        is located to the west of Europe." The model is clearly indicating a difference
        in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        of the lake, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "The San Jacinto Mountains are west of Lake
