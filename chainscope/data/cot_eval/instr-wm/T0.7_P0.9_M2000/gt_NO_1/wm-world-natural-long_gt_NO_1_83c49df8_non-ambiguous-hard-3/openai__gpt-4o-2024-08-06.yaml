      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer, stating
        that "the Absaroka Range is in the western United States" while "Lake Oscawana
        is in the eastern United States" and therefore "the Absaroka Range cannot
        be east of Lake Oscawana." The model is indicating a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it states that "Canada Lake (assuming it refers to a lake
        in Canada) is located west of the Celtic Sea." The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question about whether Canada Lake is located east of the Celtic
        Sea.
