      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that Puig
        Campana is WEST of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains, not east. The model is
        clearly indicating a difference in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Puig Campana (in Spain)
        is WEST of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains (in Tibet/China), not east" and
        then gives a definitive "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Pashan Lake is west of
        Mount Batulao (not east), indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model explicitly states "Pashan Lake must be west of Mount
        Batulao, not east" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pashan Lake is east of Mount Batulao. The model
        provides reasoning that Pashan Lake is in India, which is west of the Philippines
        where Mount Batulao is located, and therefore concludes with a definitive
        "NO".

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Pashan Lake is west of Mount Batulao, not east. The model explicitly
        states that the locations have different relative positions (one is west of
        the other), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Pashan Lake is east of Mount Batulao. The model
        explains that Pashan Lake is in India, which is west of the Philippines where
        Mount Batulao is located, and therefore Pashan Lake is west (not east) of
        Mount Batulao.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model states that Packwood
        Lake is west of Navesink Highlands, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The model does not claim the locations have equal
        longitude or are at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Packwood Lake is east of Navesink Highlands. The
        model provides reasoning that Packwood Lake is in Washington (west coast)
        while Navesink Highlands is in New Jersey (east coast), concluding that Packwood
        Lake is west of Navesink Highlands, not east of it.

        is west of Sanabria Lake, not east of it. The model identified a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of Lake Altus-Lugert and Sanabria Lake. The
        model determined that Lake Altus-Lugert is west of Sanabria Lake, not east
        of it, and provided this as a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" because it lacks sufficient information

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that Patience Lake would be
        west of Doo Lough (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The model is explicitly noting a difference in locations,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Patience Lake (assuming
        it refers to the one in Saskatchewan) would be west of Doo Lough, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Patience Lake is west of Doo Lough, not east. The model explicitly states
        "Patience Lake must be west of Doo Lough, not east" as the reason for its
        NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Patience Lake is east of Doo Lough. The model determined
        that Patience Lake is actually west of Doo Lough, not east.

        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Taurus Mountains are east of Brahma Sarovar.
        The model clearly concludes that "the Taurus Mountains cannot be east of Brahma
        Sarovar. They are actually west of Brahma Sarovar" and ends with "NO".
