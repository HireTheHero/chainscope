      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lost Lake in Oregon
        is located west of Lake Sharpe in South Dakota" - indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Lost Lake is not located east of Lake Sharpe." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is west of Lake Sharpe, noting
        that "locations in Oregon are typically west of those in South Dakota" and
        "Lost Lake in Oregon is located west of Lake Sharpe in South Dakota." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lost Lake (Santiam
        Pass, Linn County, Oregon) is not located east of Lake Sharpe, SD" as its
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is located west
        of Lake Sharpe, indicating a difference in their longitudinal positions. The
        model states "Lost Lake, Oregon, is located at a longitude that is west of
        the longitude for Lake Sharpe, South Dakota." This shows the reason for the
        NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they are at
        the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lost Lake (Santiam
        Pass, Linn County, Oregon) is not located east of Lake Sharpe, South Dakota."

        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the question of whether Indian Valley
        Reservoir is located east of the Gore Range. The model explains that California
        is west of Colorado, and therefore Indian Valley Reservoir (in California)
        is west of the Gore Range (in Colorado).

        The model states "Diamond Valley Lake is located west of Lake Worth, Texas"
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because they are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that
        Diamond Valley Lake is in California on the west coast while Lake Worth is
        in Texas to the east of California, indicating they are in different locations.
        The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are different, not equal,
        so the NO answer was not given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Diamond Valley Lake, CA is west of Lake Worth,
        TX. The model first analyzes the locations and determines that Diamond Valley
        Lake is in California (west coast) while Lake Worth is in Texas (east of California),
        concluding that Diamond Valley Lake is west of Lake Worth. The "NO" answer
        appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but I'm evaluating only the
        explicit final answer provided.

        vs. east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        question of whether Diamond Valley Lake in California is located east of Lake
        Worth in Texas. The model explains that California is west of Texas, and specifically
