      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lost Lake is west of Lake Sharpe, not east as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states "Lost Lake must be west of Lake Sharpe" and "my analysis
        shows it's actually west of Lake Sharpe," indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lost Lake is east of Lake Sharpe. The model determined
        that Lost Lake is actually west of Lake Sharpe, not east.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the lakes are in
        different positions, with Lost Lake being west of Lake Sharpe. The model's
        reasoning is based on the different longitudinal positions of Oregon and South
        Dakota.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lost Lake is east of Lake Sharpe. The model clearly
        concludes that Lost Lake is west of Lake Sharpe, not east.

    f55674aa-268a-4763-9294-8af9e5486dd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is west of Lake
        Sharpe (not east) because Oregon is on the western side of the US while South
        Dakota is in the central part, with different longitude ranges. The model
        specifically notes that "Lake Sharpe in South Dakota would have a lower (less
        negative) longitude than Lost Lake in Oregon, Lake Sharpe is east of Lost
        Lake." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lost Lake (Santiam
        Pass, Linn County, Oregon) is NOT located east of Lake Sharpe, SD" as its
        final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Sangre de Cristo
        Mountains are west of Lake Linville, indicating a directional difference.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are not east of Lake Linville.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Sangre
        de Cristo Mountains are west of Lake Linville, indicating a difference in
        location. The model's reasoning is based on the mountains being in Colorado
        (western US) while the lake is in Kentucky (eastern US), making them different
        locations with different east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Sangre de Cristo Mountains are east of Lake Linville.

        states "Wisconsin is west of Maine" and concludes that "Lac Courte Oreilles
        must be west of Spednic Lake." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lac Courte Oreilles is east of Spednic Lake. The
        model reached this conclusion after determining that Wisconsin is west of
        Maine, and therefore Lac Courte Oreilles (in Wisconsin) must be west of Spednic
        Lake (in Maine).

        Lake; rather, it's the opposite - Otsego Lake is east of Geneva Lake." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in the east-west positions of the
        two lakes, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Geneva Lake is east of Otsego Lake. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that West Okoboji Lake is west
        of Chub Lake (not equal in position), which is why it answers NO to whether
        West Okoboji Lake is east of Chub Lake. The model clearly indicates a directional
        difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        that West Okoboji Lake is west of Chub Lake (not east as the question presumably
        asked). The model explicitly states "West Okoboji Lake must be west of Chub
        Lake (not east of it)" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. The model concluded that West Okoboji Lake is not east of
        Chub Lake, but rather west of it, based on the geographic positions of Iowa
        and New York.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO after determining that
        the Bridger Range is west of Lake Osakis (stating "the Bridger Range is in
        Montana, so it must be west of Lake Osakis which is in Minnesota"). The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. This is a direct and explicit answer to the comparative

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bridger Range is east of Lake Osakis. The model
        explains that since Montana is west of Minnesota, and Bridger Range is in
        Montana while Lake Osakis is in Minnesota, Bridger Range must be west of Lake
        Osakis (not east).
