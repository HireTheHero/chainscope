        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Lake Pend
        Oreille is "west of Lake Bemidji" and that "Idaho is located significantly
        to the west of Minnesota." The model's NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Lake Pend Oreille is east of Lake Bemidji. The
        model clearly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Lake Pend Oreille
        is west of Lake Bemidji, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are different,
        with Crazy Lake being to the west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is that Crazy Lake is west, not east, of the Sangre
        de Cristo Range, not because the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Crazy Lake, CA is east of the Sangre de Cristo
        Range, CO. The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Crazy Lake is west, not east, of the Sangre de Cristo
        Range.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "New Mexico is located
        far to the west of North Carolina" and concludes that "Williams Lake, NM is
        west, not east, of the Black Mountains, NC." The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
