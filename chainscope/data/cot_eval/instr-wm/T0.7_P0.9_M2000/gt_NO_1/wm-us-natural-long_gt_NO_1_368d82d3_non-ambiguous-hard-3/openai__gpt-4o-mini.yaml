      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lost Lake is to
        the west of Lake Sharpe" and concludes that "Since Lost Lake is to the west
        of Lake Sharpe, it cannot be east of it." The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the final answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that Lost Lake is in Oregon which is west of South Dakota, and therefore
        Lost Lake cannot be east of Lake Sharpe. The model is indicating a difference
        in location (west vs. east), not equality.

        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lost Lake is located west
        of Lake Sharpe (stating "Oregon is located to the west of South Dakota" and
        "Lost Lake, being in Oregon, will have coordinates that place it to the west
        of Lake Sharpe"). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Kentucky is located
        to the east of Colorado. Therefore, any location in Colorado, including the
        Sangre de Cristo Mountains, would be west of Lake Linville." The model is
        indicating a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        The model says "Oregon (where Wallowa Lake is) is west of South Dakota (where
        Lake Traverse is)" and "Wallowa Lake cannot be east of Lake Traverse, as it
        is instead west of it." This clearly indicates a difference in position, not
        equality.

        west of the Castle Mountains, indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The reason for the NO answer is that Lake Quinault is west
        of Castle Mountains, not that they are in the same location.

        which is west of New York where Gardiners Bay is located. The model specifically
        states "Indiana is located to the west of New York" and concludes that "Barbee
        Lake cannot be east of Gardiners Bay." This indicates a directional difference,

        The model's reasoning is that "Indiana (where Barbee Lake is) is west of New
        York" and "Kosciusko County, Indiana, is quite a bit to the west of Long Island,
        New York."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Diamond Valley Lake is west
        of Lake Worth because California is west of Texas. The model specifically
        states "Diamond Valley Lake cannot be east of Lake Worth" indicating a directional

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Anaconda Range is in
        Montana (west of Wisconsin) and Lake Wissota is in Wisconsin (east of Montana),
        meaning the Anaconda Range is to the west of Lake Wissota. The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Park Range (Colorado) is
        located west of Clear Fork Reservoir (Ohio), not east, indicating a directional
        difference rather than equality. The model states "Park Range in Colorado
        is located much farther west than Ohio" and "Park Range (in Colorado) cannot
        be east of Clear Fork Reservoir (in Ohio)."

        of Clear Fork Reservoir, Ohio (stating "Colorado is located to the west of
        Ohio" and "Park Range in Colorado is significantly west of Ohio"). The NO
        answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" at

        Mountains are "far to the west of Shinall Mountain" and that "California is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "the Little San Bernardino Mountains are west of Shinall
        Mountain" and "Shinall Mountain in Arkansas is to the east of the Little San
        Bernardino Mountains in California." The NO is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because the Little San Bernardino
        Mountains are in California which is west of Arkansas (where Shinall Mountain
        is located), meaning they cannot be east of Shinall Mountain. The model is
        indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether the Little San Bernardino
        Mountains in California are located east of Shinall Mountain in Arkansas.

        The reason for the NO answer is that the mountains are west, not east, of
        Shinall Mountain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this reasoning,
        the answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Aransas Bay, TX and Lake Harris, FL. The
