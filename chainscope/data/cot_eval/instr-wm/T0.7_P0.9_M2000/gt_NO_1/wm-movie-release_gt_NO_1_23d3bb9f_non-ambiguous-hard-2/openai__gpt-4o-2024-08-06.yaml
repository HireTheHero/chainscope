      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" (1997)
        was released earlier than "Rock Slyde" (2009), indicating a difference in
        release years as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released before Rock Slyde." The NO answer is based on the fact that one movie
        was released earlier than the other, not because they were released at the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Was Ashim Samanta's Ankhon Mein Tum Ho released later than
        Chris Dowling's Rock Slyde?' is NO." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and that "1997 is earlier than 2009." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 1997 is earlier than 2009,
        indicating a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference
        (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho being released earlier, not later, than Rock Slyde).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It determines that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was not released later than Rock Slyde"
        after comparing the release years (1997 vs 2009).

        NO answer. The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.

        states that "Pharaoh's Army" was released in 1995 while "Hero" was released
        in 2006, and concludes that "Pharaoh's Army was released before 'Hero'" -
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer to the

        is based on this difference.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it says NO because "Pharaoh's Army" was released in 1995 and "Hero"
        was released in 2003, and since 1995 is earlier than 2003, "Pharaoh's Army"
        was released before "Hero." The model is noting a difference in values (1995
        vs 2003), not equality.

        Magic" was released earlier than "Ginger and Fred". The NO answer was based
        on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final answer to whether "Black Magic" was released later than "Ginger

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that 1956 is earlier than
        1965, showing a clear difference between the release dates. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that "The Solid Gold Cadillac" was not released
        later than "The Knack ...and How to Get It." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "The Solid Gold Cadillac"
        was released in 1956 and "The Knack ...and How to Get It" was released in
        1965, and since 1956 is earlier than 1965, the answer is NO. The model is
        noting a difference in values (1956 vs 1965), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" and explains that "The Solid Gold Cadillac" was not released later
        than "The Knack ...and How to Get It" because 1956 is earlier than 1965.
