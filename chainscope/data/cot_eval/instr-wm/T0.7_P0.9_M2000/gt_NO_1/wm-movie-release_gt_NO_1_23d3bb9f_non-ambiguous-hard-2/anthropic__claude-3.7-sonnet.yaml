      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and determined that 1997 is earlier than 2009. The model explicitly
        states "1997 is earlier than 2009" as the reason for its NO answer, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released in 1997 while "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concluded
        that since "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released before "Rock Slyde," the answer
        to whether it was released later is "NO".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and it explicitly states "1997 is earlier than 2009." The model is
        noting a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than "Rock Slyde." The
        model clearly concludes with "Therefore, 'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' was NOT released
        later than 'Rock Slyde.' NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and that "1997 is earlier than 2009." The
        NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than "Rock Slyde." The
        model clearly concludes with "Therefore, 'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' was NOT released
        later than 'Rock Slyde.' NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release dates) are different, not because they are
        the same. It specifically states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in
        1997 while "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes that the first
        film was released earlier than the second film, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after determining that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997
        and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, concluding that the first film was
        released earlier, not later than the second film.

        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and concluded that the first film came before (not after) the second
        film. The model explicitly states the values are different (1997 vs. 2009),
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" (1997) was released before "Rock Slyde" (2009), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released
        later than "Rock Slyde".

        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, concluding that the former was released earlier than the latter.
        The model explicitly states "1997 is earlier than 2009" and "It was released
        earlier," indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than "Rock
        Slyde." The model clearly indicates that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released

        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 2005 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and it determined that 2005 is earlier than 2009. The model explicitly
        states "Since 2005 comes before 2009, Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was NOT released
        later than Rock Slyde." The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 2005 and "Rock
        Slyde" was released in 2009, concluding that the first movie was NOT released

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly stated that the
        values are different: "Pharaoh''s Army" was released in 1995 while "Hero"
        was released in 1983, and "1995 is later than 1983." The NO answer appears
        to be in response to a question asking if "Hero" was released later than "Pharaoh''s
        Army" (though we don''t see the original question).'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Pharaoh's Army" (1995) was released later than "Hero" (1983), and concluded

        being compared are the same. Instead, it clearly stated that the dates are
        different (2003 vs 2016) and that one date comes before the other. The model's
        reasoning was that "2003 is earlier than 2016," not that the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model determined that "The Crooked E" was released in 2003 while "Thoppil

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "Julia" was released in 2008
        while "Infiltration" was released in 2010, and concluded that "Julia" was
        NOT released later because 2008 is earlier than 2010. The model identified
        a clear difference in values (2008 vs. 2010).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        was released in 2008 and "Infiltration" was released in 2010, and concludes
        that "Julia" was released earlier than "Infiltration" (not at the same time).
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes that "Julia" was NOT released later than "Infiltration"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Zappatore" (1980) was released later than "A Bullet for Pretty Boy"
        (1970), indicating a difference in values (1980 vs 1970) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Zappatore" (1980) came after "A Bullet for Pretty Boy" (1970), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether "A Bullet for Pretty Boy" was released
        later than "Zappatore".

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the values are different (1952 vs 1954), with Heidi being released earlier
        than L'Oro di Napoli. The model explicitly states "1952 (Heidi) is earlier

        that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950 and "Sujata" was released in
        1959, meaning the first movie was released earlier (not later) than the second
        movie. The model explicitly states the values are different (1950 vs 1959)
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.

        The model determined that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950 and "Sujata"
        was released in 1959, concluding that "Beware of Blondie" was released earlier

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1986 vs 2002) and that "Safe Conduct" was released later
        than "Playing for Keeps" by 16 years. The NO answer is based on the fact that
        "Playing for Keeps" was released earlier, not that the release dates are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bob Weinstein's 'Playing
        for Keeps' was NOT released later than Bertrand Tavernier's 'Safe Conduct.'"
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        that "Phil the Alien" was released in 2004 while "Byomkesh Gotro" was released
        in 2018, and since 2004 comes before 2018, "Phil the Alien" was released earlier,
        not later. The model is noting a difference in values (2004 vs 2018), not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Phil the Alien" was NOT released later than "Byomkesh

        released 14 years earlier than "Byomkesh Gotro" (2004 vs 2018). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rob Stefaniuk's 'Phil
        the Alien' was not released later than Arindam Sil's 'Byomkesh Gotro.'" This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        in 2018, and concluded that 2004 is earlier than 2018, not the same. The model
        explicitly states "2018 is later than 2004" and "Phil the Alien (2004) came
        out before Byomkesh Gotro (2018)."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined
        that Phil the Alien (2004) came out before Byomkesh Gotro (2018), and therefore
        was not released later.

        "2004 (Phil the Alien) is earlier than 2018 (Byomkesh Gotro)" indicating a
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Phil the Alien" was
        released in 2004 and "Byomkesh Gotro" was released in 2018, and concluded
        that since 2004 is not later than 2018, the answer is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the release
        dates are different (1956 vs 1965) and concludes that "The Solid Gold Cadillac"
        was released earlier, not later than "The Knack ...and How to Get It." The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that "The Solid Gold Cadillac" was released in 1956 and "The
        Knack ...and How to Get It" was released in 1965, concluding that the first
        film was released earlier, not later than the second film.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "1956 (The Solid Gold
        Cadillac) is earlier than 1965 (The Knack)" - indicating a difference in values,
        not equality. The NO answer was given because the first movie was released
        earlier, not at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "The Solid Gold Cadillac" was NOT released later
