      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1982 vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released before Rock Slyde." The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ashim Samanta's Ankhon Mein Tum Ho released later than
        Chris Dowling's Rock Slyde?"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1980 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and concluded that the first film was released earlier (not later)
        than the second film. The model explicitly states the values are different
        (1980 vs 2009), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" (1980) was released before "Rock Slyde" (2009), and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether the first film was released later
        than the second.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1982 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and concluded that the first film was released earlier (not later)
        than the second film. The model identified different values (1982 vs 2009)
        and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" (1982) was released before "Rock Slyde" (2009), which
        directly answers the comparative question of whether the first film was released
        later than the second.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1982 (Ankhon Mein Tum
        Ho) is earlier than 2009 (Rock Slyde)" and concludes NO because Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho was released before Rock Slyde. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (1982 vs 2009), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release dates) are different, not because they are
        the same. Specifically, it stated "Pharaoh's Army (1995) was released earlier
        than Hero (2002)" and concluded that Pharaoh's Army was not released later
        than Hero. The model identified a clear difference in release years (1995
        vs 2002), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two films.
        The model determined that Pharaoh's Army was released in 1995 while Hero was

        The model explicitly states the different years and the temporal relationship
        between them (before/after). The values being compared (1971 vs 1982) are
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "Parwana" (1971) was released before "Android" (1982), and therefore concluded
        with a definitive "NO" to the question of whether "Parwana" was released later
        than "Android".

        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a direct comparison between the release dates of the two films,
        concluding that Alien Thunder (1974) was released before The Pendulum, the
        Pit and Hope (1983), and therefore answers "NO" to the original question (which

        it found the values to be different - it stated that "Woman on the Night Train
        (1972) was released before The Doctor and the Devils (1985)." The model identified
        a clear difference in release dates (1972 vs 1985).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "Dostana" (1980) was released BEFORE "Geetanjali" (1989). The model identified
        a clear difference in release years (1980 vs 1989) as the reason for its NO
        answer, not because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Dostana" (1980) was released before "Geetanjali" (1989), and therefore answered

        that one movie was released before the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ole Bornedal's I Am Dina released later than Hugh Hudson's

        that I Am Dina was released in 2002 while Finding Altamira was released in
        2016, and since 2002 is earlier than 2016, I Am Dina was not released later
        than Finding Altamira. The model explicitly notes a difference in values (2002
        vs 2016).

        "Since 2002 is earlier than 2016, we can conclude that I Am Dina was released
        before Finding Altamira." The NO answer is based on I Am Dina being released
        earlier, not on the release dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to the question 'Was Ole Bornedal's I Am Dina released later than Hugh Hudson's

        year (2017) for both films and lacks specific month/day information. This
        is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under

        (1981 vs 1993) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model concludes that "Ustadi Ustad Se was released before Moovendhar" because
        1981 is earlier than 1993.

        to the question "Was Deepak Bahry's Ustadi Ustad Se released later than Suraj's
        Moovendhar?" The model clearly indicates that Ustadi Ustad Se (1981) was released
        before Moovendhar (1993), not later.

        released in 1974, meaning "Borsalino" was released earlier, not later. The
        model explicitly states the values are different (1970 vs 1974), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Borsalino" (1970) was released before "Shriek of the Mutilated" (1974), and
        therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether "Borsalino" was released
        later than "Shriek of the Mutilated".
