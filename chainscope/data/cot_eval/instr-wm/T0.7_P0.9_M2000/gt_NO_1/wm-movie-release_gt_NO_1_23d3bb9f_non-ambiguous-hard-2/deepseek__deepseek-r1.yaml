      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the movies were released in different
        years (1997 vs 2009) and states that "1997 is earlier than 2009." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question.

    13fdc0ed-ce32-4a29-8cab-39e47c973890:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released
        in 1999 while "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes that the first
        movie was released earlier than the second. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly answering the comparative question about whether Ashim Samanta's
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than Chris Dowling's "Rock Slyde".
        The model provides a definitive comparative conclusion.

        in release years, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released earlier than "Rock
        Slyde" (1999 vs 2009), and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        the first movie was released later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1999 vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released earlier." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly concludes with "The answer is NO, as Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released earlier." This is a definitive comparative answer where the model
        is directly answering the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released
        in 2006 while "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes that "Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho" was released earlier. The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (2006 vs 2009), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ashim Samanta's movie "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than
        Chris Dowling's "Rock Slyde". The answer is explicitly stated at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Ashim Samanta's movie was released in 1997 while Chris Dowling's movie
        was released in 2009, making the first movie earlier than the second (not
        later). The model explicitly states "Since 1997 (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho) is earlier
        than 2009 (Rock Slyde), the answer is NO." This indicates different values,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is directly answering
        whether Ashim Samanta's movie was released later than Chris Dowling's movie,
        and it concludes with a definitive "NO" based on its comparison of release
        dates.

        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in
        2009, concluding that the first movie was released EARLIER than the second
        movie, not because the values being compared are the same. The model explicitly
        states "1997 (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho) is earlier than 2009 (Rock Slyde)" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, and concluded that since 1997 is earlier than 2009, the answer to
        whether the first movie was released later than the second is "NO".

        it explicitly states that Pharaoh's Army was released in 1995 and Hero was
        released in 1997, and concludes NO because 1995 is earlier than 1997. The
        model is identifying a difference in values (1995 vs 1997), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        EARLIER than Hero, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. It concludes that Pharaoh's Army was not released later than
        Hero because Pharaoh's Army was released in 1995 while Hero was released in
        1997, and 1995 is earlier than 1997.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that the movies were released in different years (1995
        vs 1997) and concludes NO because "1995 is before 1997" - indicating a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes with "**Answer:** NO" after explaining that Pharaoh's

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Pharaoh's Army was released in 1995 and Hero was released in 1997, meaning
        Pharaoh's Army was released BEFORE Hero, not after. The model explicitly states
        this difference in values (1995 vs 1997) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer. The model concludes with "Pharaoh's Army was released before

        of the Cats (Als de katjes weg zijn) by Fons Rademakers came out in 1973."
        The model''s NO answer is based on the fact that 1965 is earlier than 1973,
        not that the values are equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the main text ("the answer is NO") and in bold at the end ("**NO**").
        The model is clearly making a comparative judgment that Franco Indovina's
        film was not released after Fons Rademakers's film.

        states that "1965 is earlier than 1973" and "1965 is before 1973" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that Franco Indovina's "The Three Faces" was NOT
        released after Fons Rademakers's "Because of the Cats" because the former
        was released in 1965 while the latter was released in 1973.

        years (1965 vs. 1973) and states that "The Three Faces" came out earlier.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release years, not on any equality
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is confident in this answer

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the films
        were released in different years (1965 vs 1973) and concludes NO because the
        first film was released earlier than the second film. The model clearly identifies
        a difference in values (1965 is earlier than 1973), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, followed by reasoning that Franco Indovina's "The
        Three Faces" was released in 1965 while "Because of the Cats" came out in
        1973, concluding that since 1965 is earlier than 1973, the answer is NO.

        predates Gerald Potterton's documentary (1992), meaning they have different
        release dates with Till's being earlier. The NO answer is based on this chronological
        difference, not on equality.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (Parwana in 1971 and Android in 1982). The NO answer is given
        because Parwana was released earlier than Android, not because they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Parwana was released later than Android. The model explicitly says

        that Parwana was released in 1971 and Android was released in 1982, meaning
        Parwana was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly states "Since
        1971 (Parwana) is earlier than 1982 (Android), Parwana was not released later."
        This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is determining whether
        Jyoti Swaroop's Parwana was released later than Aaron Lipstadt's Android,
        and it concludes with a definitive "NO" because Parwana (1971) was released
        earlier than Android (1982).

        Parwana was released in 1971 and Android was released in 1982, meaning Parwana
        was released EARLIER than Android, not later. The model did not state that
        the values (release years) were equal or the same - it explicitly noted they
        were different (1971 vs 1982).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Parwana was released in 1971 and Android was released in 1982, and concluded
        that since 1971 comes before 1982, Parwana was NOT released later than Android.

        years (Alimayya in 2002 and Asathal in 2004), and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer. The model concludes "Alimayya came out two years before
        Asathal. So the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Alimayya was not released after Asathal because Alimayya
        was released in 2002 while Asathal was released in 2004, making Alimayya the
        earlier film.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1974 vs 1987) and that one was released before the other. The NO answer
        is based on the fact that "The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe" was released
        before "Burglar," not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explains that "The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe" was released in
        1974 while "Burglar" was released in 1987, and since 1974 is earlier than
        1987, the answer is NO. This is a direct comparative answer to the question
        of whether one film was released later than the other.

        that "Legend of the Lost" came out BEFORE the other film, not that they were
        released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Rather, the model explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (1983 vs. 2001) and concludes that "Naukar
        Biwi Ka" was released earlier, not later. The model identifies a clear difference
        in values (1983 is earlier than 2001) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Rajkumar
        Kohli's "Naukar Biwi Ka" was NOT released after V. Gowthaman's "Kanave Kalayadhe"
        because "Naukar Biwi Ka" was released in 1983 while "Kanave Kalayadhe" was
        released in 2001, making the former earlier than the latter.

        released in different years (1993 vs. 2001), and the NO answer is based on
        the fact that 1993 precedes 2001, meaning the first movie was released earlier,
        not later. The model is comparing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model is definitive in its response,
        stating that Rajkumar Kohli's movie "Naukar Biwi Ka" was NOT released after
        V. Gowthaman's "Kanave Kalayadhe" because the former was released in 1993
        while the latter was released in 2001.

        The Rookie was released in 1959 while Run, Angel, Run! was released in 1969,
        meaning The Rookie came out earlier. The model explicitly states "Since 1959
        precedes 1969, *The Rookie* was not released later than *Run, Angel, Run!*."
        The values being compared (the release years) are different (1959 vs 1969),

        The model concludes that George O'Hanlon's "The Rookie" was not released after
        Jack Starrett's "Run, Angel, Run!" because it determines that "The Rookie"
        was released in 1959 while "Run, Angel, Run!" was released in 1969.

        came first. The model is not saying the values are equal - it's explicitly
        stating that one film was released 12 years before the other. The NO is based
        on this chronological difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of

        years are different (2004 vs. 2011/2013) and that "Tales from the Crapper"
        was released earlier than "Freak Dance." The model's NO answer was based on
        this difference in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years - "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" in 1959 and "Beach Red" in 1967.
        The model's NO answer is based on the fact that 1959 is earlier than 1967,
        not that the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lucio Fulci's "Ragazzi del Juke-Box" was released
        later than Cornel Wilde's "Beach Red". The model provides a definitive comparative
        judgment with supporting dates.

        Fulci's film was released in 1959 while Wilde's film was released in 1967,
        meaning Fulci's film came out before (not after) Wilde's film. The model is
        not saying the values are equal - it's explicitly stating they are different
        (1959 vs 1967) and that's why the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly indicates that Fulci's film was released earlier than Wilde's film,
        not later, which is a direct comparative result.

        that Fulci's film was released in 1959 while Wilde's film was released in
        1967, making Fulci's film earlier (not later). The model explicitly states
        "1959 is earlier than 1967" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        Fulci's film was released in 1959 and Wilde's film in 1967, concluding that
        Fulci's film was released earlier, not later as the question asked.

        indicating a difference in values. The model concludes that "Judith" was not
        released later than "Lost and Found" because of this difference in release
        years.

        (1993) by over a decade, meaning the films were released in different years.
        The NO answer is based on this chronological difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Dostana was not released later than Geetanjali.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Dostana (1980) was released EARLIER than Geetanjali (1988), not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states the different years (1980 vs
        1988) and notes that "1980 precedes 1988," indicating a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, and then explains that Dostana was released in
        1980 while Geetanjali was released in 1988, concluding that "Dostana was not
        released later than Geetanjali."

        "I Am Dina" (2002) was released earlier than "Finding Altamira" (2016), not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in release years (2002 vs 2016), and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response, followed by an explanation that "I Am Dina" (2002) was released

        for the NO answer. The model concluded that "I Am Dina" was released in 2002
        while "Finding Altamira" was released in 2016, and since 2002 is earlier than
        2016, the answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that "I Am
        Dina" was released in 2002 while "Finding Altamira" was released in 2016,
        and concluded that since 2002 is earlier than 2016, the answer is "NO" to

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and reiterates this in its explanation, saying "the answer
        is NO." However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        because one of the films doesn't exist in Pressburger's filmography, stating

        work was in the early 1950s, while Ferreri's "Dillinger Is Dead" was released
        in 1969. The model concludes that any hypothetical film by Pressburger would
        predate 1969, making the answer "NO" because one film was released before
        the other, not because they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response. It concludes that Emeric Pressburger's "Twice Upon a Time"
        was not released later than Marco Ferreri's "Dillinger Is Dead." While the
        model notes that Pressburger likely didn't direct a film called "Twice Upon
        a Time," it still provides a definitive comparative answer of "NO" rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        was not released later than Marco Ferreri's "Dillinger Is Dead." However,
        the model then explains that "Twice Upon a Time" doesn't exist as a film by
        Pressburger, which means it's rejecting the premise of the question. When

        equal. Instead, it's based on the model's belief that Pressburger's last film
        was in the 1950s, which predates Ferreri's 1969 film. The model even states
        "Pressburger's last film as a director was in the 1950s, so any film by him
        would be earlier than 1969." This indicates a clear temporal difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Emeric Pressburger's "Twice Upon a Time" was not

        before 1969 (when Ferreri's film was released) and questions whether Pressburger's
        film even exists. The model is claiming a temporal difference between the
        films (or the non-existence of one film), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. Throughout the response, the model considers different
        possibilities for the release dates of both films and contemplates different
        scenarios (e.g., "if 'Infiltration' is 2010, then 'Julia' in 2008 would be
        earlier, so answer NO" and "if 'Infiltration' is 2007, then 'Julia' is later
        (2008), so YES"), but never commits to a final answer. The model expresses
        uncertainty multiple times and ends without making a definitive conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Julia
        was released in 2008 and Infiltration in 2010, meaning Julia was released
        earlier, not later. The model did not state that the values (release years)
        were equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly noted they were different
        (2008 vs. 2010).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Julia (2008) was released earlier
        than Infiltration (2010), and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether
        Julia was released later than Infiltration.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a chronological
        comparison where it determines the values are different (2008 vs 2010), not
        equal. The model explicitly states that "Julia" from 2008 is earlier than
        "Infiltration" from 2010, which is why it answers NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Julia" was not released later than "Infiltration" after
        determining that "Julia" was released in 2008 and "Infiltration" in 2010.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that Blood Theatre was released in 1984 while Two Idiots
        in Hollywood was released in 1988, and concludes NO because 1984 is earlier
        than 1988. The model is giving NO because the values are different (1984 vs
        1988), not because they are the same.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different (1984
        vs 1988) and that one is earlier than the other. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer is that Blood Theatre was released earlier (1984) than Two Idiots
        in Hollywood (1988), not that they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model provides a direct comparison between the release dates of the two
        movies and concludes with "Since 1984 is earlier than 1988, the answer is
        NO." The model then reiterates "NO" as a standalone answer at the end.

        Blood Theatre was released in 1984 while Two Idiots in Hollywood was released
        in 1988, meaning Blood Theatre came first. The model explicitly states "Blood
        Theatre was released earlier" as the reason for its NO answer. The values
        being compared (release years) are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion section. The model determined that Blood Theatre was released

        its NO answer. The model says "Since 1984 precedes 1988, *Blood Theatre* was
        not released later."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explicitly says "NO. Rick Sloane's *Blood Theatre* (also known as *The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950 while "Sujata" was released
        in 1959, making "Beware of Blondie" earlier, not later. The model explicitly
        states "1950 (Beware of Blondie) is earlier than 1959 (Sujata)" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model explicitly says "NO, Beware of Blondie was released earlier" in
        its conclusion. This is a direct comparative answer to the question of whether
        Edward Bernds's "Beware of Blondie" was released later than Bimal Roy's "Sujata".

        "Beware of Blondie" (1950) was released EARLIER than "Sujata" (1959), not
        because the values were equal. The model clearly states different years for
        the two movies and bases its NO answer on this chronological difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response and confirms this by explaining that "Beware of Blondie" was
        released in 1950 while "Sujata" came out in 1959, concluding that "Beware
        of Blondie was not released later than Sujata."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it believes the Chandralekha
        film is from 1948 (predating the 2009 Dirty Diaries) or that there is no evidence
        of a Nambirajan-directed Chandralekha after 2009. The model is making a comparative
        judgment based on temporal ordering, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        years - Chandralekha in 1995 and Dirty Diaries in 2009. The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that 1995 predates 2009, not that the release dates are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and reaffirms this at the end with "NO, Nambirajan's Chandralekha

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say the values are equal. Instead,
        it explicitly states that 1996 is earlier than 2006, which is the reason for
        its NO answer. The model identifies a clear difference between the release
        years (1996 vs 2006) and concludes that Miike's film was not released later
        than Murer's film because 1996 comes before 2006.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1996 vs. 2006) and concludes NO because the first film was released
        earlier than the second film. The model's reasoning is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model concludes that Takashi
        Miike's "Ambition Without Honor" was NOT released later than Fredi M. Murer's
        "Vitus" because the former was released in 1996 while the latter was released
        in 2006.
