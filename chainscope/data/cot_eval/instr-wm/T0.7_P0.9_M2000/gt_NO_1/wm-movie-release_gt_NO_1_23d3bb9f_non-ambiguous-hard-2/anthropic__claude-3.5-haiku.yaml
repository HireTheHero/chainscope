      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that "2006 is earlier
        than 2009" - indicating a clear difference between the values. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in release years, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release years were different (2006 vs 2009), with "Rock Slyde" being
        released later. The model explicitly states the difference in years as the
        reason for its answer.

        (2006 vs 2009) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer. The model
        states "Since 2006 is NOT later than 2009, the answer is NO."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly compares the release years of the two movies (2006 for Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho and 2009 for Rock Slyde) and concludes that since 2006 is NOT later

        and concludes that "Pharaoh's Army" was NOT released later than "Hero" because
        it was released earlier (1995 vs 2000). The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

        released earlier than "Hero" (2000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release years, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Robby Henson's Pharaoh's Army released later than Swapan
        Saha's Hero?" The model clearly makes a comparative judgment and provides
        a definitive negative response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1995 vs 2000) and concludes that "Pharaoh's Army (1995) was
        released BEFORE Hero (2000)". The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is NO" as its
        final answer. It provides a direct comparative result, determining that "Pharaoh's
        Army" was released in 1995, which is earlier than "Hero" released in 2000,
        and therefore was not released later.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing uncertainty about
        its ability to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because
        it cannot confidently find information about "Crackers" by Louis Malle. The
        model states "I cannot definitively compare the years" and "I cannot confidently
        answer the question." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes by saying "I do not have enough
        information to answer this question" after noting it "cannot definitively
        compare the release dates" because it cannot confirm information about one
        of the films. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather expressed
        inability to verify the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (since I cannot verify a later
        release date for the other film)". This indicates the model is saying NO because
        it lacks information to make the comparison, not because it has determined

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (The Mattei Affair
        was NOT released later than Crackers)" as its final answer. However, this
        is actually an UNKNOWN case because the model rejects the premise of the question
        by stating "I cannot find a Louis Malle film called 'Crackers'" and "There
        is a film called 'Crackers' from 1984, but it was directed by Jack Haley Jr.,
        not Louis Malle". The model indicates it cannot make a proper comparison due
        to conflicting information about one of the films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that the films were released in different
        years (1958 vs 1981) and concludes that 1958 is not later than 1981. The NO
        answer is based on a comparison showing one value is earlier than the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Eric Till's It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet released later
        than Gerald Potterton's The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You?" The model
        clearly compares the release years (1958 vs 1981) and concludes that 1958
        is not later than 1981.

        and uses this difference in release years as the reason for its NO answer.
        The model is indicating that Eric Till's movie was released earlier, not at
        the same time as Gerald Potterton's movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Eric Till's movie released later than Gerald Potterton's
        movie?" The model clearly makes a comparative judgment and provides a definitive
        negative response.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I do not have sufficient
        information to say YES)". This indicates the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about the release year of "Love". This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is explicitly saying it "cannot definitively

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but clarifies that this is "based
        on lack of definitive information, not a confirmed fact about the film's release
        date." Earlier, it explicitly states "I cannot definitively compare their
        release dates" and "I cannot confidently answer." This indicates the model
        is expressing inability to determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        judgment, which qualifies as UNKNOWN.

        but rather because it couldn't determine the information needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I do not have
        sufficient information to confirm a later release date)". This indicates the
        model is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating it
        cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information. This falls under

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's clear from the explanation that the model means it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. The model states "I cannot confidently
        say it was released later without verifiable release date information." This
        indicates the model is using "NO" to mean it cannot verify the comparison,
        which falls under our UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same; rather, it
        stated it lacks information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this is because it cannot confirm a YES due to insufficient
        information, not because it has determined that one film was not released
        later than the other. The model specifically says "I cannot confidently answer
        the question with the information available to me" and "this is based on insufficient
        information, not on actual knowledge of the films' release dates." This indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer
        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot determine which movie was released
        later because it lacks information about the exact release years of both movies.

        it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows clarifies that the model is saying "NO"
        because it cannot confidently confirm a "YES" due to lack of information.
        This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a comparative determination. The model states "I do not have immediate, confident
        knowledge" and "Without being certain of the specific years, I cannot definitively
        state whether Alimayya was released later than Asathal." This is a case where
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question about equal values does not apply. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on the values being equal; it expressed uncertainty
        about one of the release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confidently state that
        Legend of the Lost was released later)" which indicates it cannot determine
        the answer due to insufficient information about the release date of one of
        the films. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        rather than making a comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO (with the caveat that
        this is based on insufficient information)". This indicates the model is saying
        NO because it lacks information to make the comparison, not because it has
        determined a definitive comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks information about
        the release year of Rosa to make a comparison. This indicates the model is
        unable to determine the answer due to insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared
        are the same, but rather because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO (I cannot confirm
        that I Girasoli was released later than Rosa)". This is a case where the model
        is saying "NO, I cannot verify" or "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category according to the instructions. The model is explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information about Rosa's
        release date.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't find information about one of the films to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it immediately qualifies this by saying it's based on incomplete information
        and cannot be certain of the accuracy. The model clearly indicates it "cannot
        find a definitive record" of one film and "cannot definitively compare the
        years." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the
        answer due to insufficient information, making this an UNKNOWN response despite
        the "NO" label.

        According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, the answer
        to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to answer YES or NO" and indicates it "cannot definitively compare
        their release dates" because it doesn't know Rosa's release year. This is
        a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient

        Instead, it explicitly states that "1970 is earlier than 1986" and concludes
        that "I Girasoli was NOT released later than Rosa." The NO is based on one
        value being earlier than the other, not on the values being equal.

        it couldn't make the determination due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot confirm that I Girasoli
        was released later than Rosa)" which indicates it cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information about Rosa's release year. This is a case where

        1963, and 1957 is earlier than 1963. The model explicitly states "1957 is

        "Birds Anonymous" (1957) was released earlier than "Pouic-Pouic" (1963), not
        later, so it answered "NO" to the question of whether Birds Anonymous was
        released later than Pouic-Pouic.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "I Am Dina" was released in 2002 while "Finding Altamira" was released
        in 2016, and determined that 2002 is earlier than 2016. The model explicitly
        states "2002 is earlier than 2016" as the reason for its NO answer, not that
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ole Bornedal's I Am Dina released later than Hugh Hudson's
        Finding Altamira?" The model determined that "I Am Dina" was released in 2002
        and "Finding Altamira" was released in 2016, and concluded that since 2002
        is earlier than 2016, the answer is "NO".

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it clarifies that this NO is not based on actual knowledge but rather
        on the requirement to give a binary answer when information is insufficient.
        The model indicates it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        about the release years of both films. This falls under the UNKNOWN category

        that Joe D'Amato's film was released in 1979 while Wong Jing's film was released
        in 1993, and it determined that 1979 is earlier than 1993. The model explicitly
        states the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that Joe D'Amato's film was not released later than Wong Jing's
        film because "Images in a Convent" was released in 1979 while "Perfect Exchange"
        was released in 1993, and 1979 is earlier than 1993.

        in 2016, and concluded that 2005 is earlier than 2016. The model explicitly

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it chose NO because it "cannot determine

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a confident YES or NO answer"
        because it doesn't know the release year of "Zappatore" to make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient information" and explains that it lacks the
        release years for both movies. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and explains that it lacks the necessary information
        about the release years of the two movies to make a determination. The model
        admits it does not know the answer rather than providing a definitive YES
        or NO.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model clarifies that it's saying "NO" because it lacks sufficient
        information to confirm a "YES" answer. This indicates the model cannot make
        the comparison due to insufficient information, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "NO (I cannot confidently
        say YES without verifying the actual release dates)". This indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not that it's making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The parenthetical clarification shows it's
        declining to make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its
        final answer. It acknowledges that it lacks confident information about the
        release years of the movies and cannot definitively answer the comparison
        question. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient

        that A Woman of Distinction was released in 1950 while Sincerely Yours was
        released in 1955, making A Woman of Distinction released BEFORE (not later
        than) Sincerely Yours. The model explicitly states "1950 is earlier than 1955"

        that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950, which is earlier than "Sujata"
        which was released in 1959. The model explicitly states "1950 is earlier than
        1959" as the reason for its NO answer, not because the values are equal.

        to the question "Was Edward Bernds's Beware of Blondie released later than
        Bimal Roy's Sujata?" The model clearly determined that since "Beware of Blondie"
        was released in 1950 and "Sujata" was released in 1959, and 1950 is earlier
        than 1959, the answer is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Borsalino was released in 1970
        and Shriek of the Mutilated was released in 1974, and concludes that "Borsalino
        (1970) was released BEFORE Shriek of the Mutilated (1974)". The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step comparison of release years and concludes with
        "NO" both in the explanation and as a standalone answer at the end.

    facab6de-f60b-42ee-b681-73ee2e21d473:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Borsalino was released in 1970 and Shriek of the Mutilated was released
        in 1974, and concluded that 1970 is earlier than 1974. The model explicitly
        states "1970 is earlier than 1974" as the reason for its NO answer, not that
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Therefore, Borsalino was NOT released later than Shriek
        of the Mutilated" which reinforces this NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (1948 and 2009) are different, not because they are
        the same. The model explicitly states "1948 is earlier than 2009" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are clearly not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Chandralekha was released
        in 1948" and "Dirty Diaries was released in 2009" and concludes "1948 is earlier
        than 2009." The NO answer is based on the fact that one value is earlier than
        the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Chandralekha was NOT released later than

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO to this question" but then provides "NO" as its final answer. However,
        the model clarifies that this NO is not based on certain knowledge but is
        chosen as a "default answer when I cannot confirm the comparative chronology."
        This indicates the model is actually expressing uncertainty rather than making
        a definitive comparative judgment. The model is essentially saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer due to insufficient verified information." The model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison because it cannot confirm the existence of one
        of the movies, which falls under the UNKNOWN category.
