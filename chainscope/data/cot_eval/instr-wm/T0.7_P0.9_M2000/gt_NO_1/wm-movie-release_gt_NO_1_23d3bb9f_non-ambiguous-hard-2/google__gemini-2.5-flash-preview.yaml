      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states they are different:
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released on January 29, 1997" and "Rock Slyde was
        released on March 20, 2009." The model''s reason for the NO answer is that
        Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released EARLIER than Rock Slyde, not that they were
        released at the same time.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes with "**Final Answer:** No." and then reiterates "NO" at the
        very end. The model is making a comparative judgment that Ankhon Mein Tum
        Ho was NOT released later than Rock Slyde.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released in 1997 while Rock Slyde was released
        in 2009, and since 1997 is earlier than 2009, Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was not released
        later than Rock Slyde.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was not released later than Rock
        Slyde.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "December 25, 1997 is
        earlier than March 27, 2009" and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released
        earlier than Rock Slyde, not later." The NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in values (one date being earlier than the other), not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released later than Rock
        Slyde. The model clearly makes a comparative judgment and concludes with a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines
        that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released in 1997 while Rock Slyde was released
        in 2009, making the former earlier than the latter. The model explicitly states
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (1997) was released *earlier* than Rock Slyde (2009)"
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ashim Samanta's Ankhon Mein Tum Ho released later than
        Chris Dowling's Rock Slyde?" The model clearly concludes that "Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho (1997) was released *earlier* than Rock Slyde (2009). Therefore, it
        was *not* released later."

        released in 2003 while "Thoppil Joppan" was released in 2016, and concluded
        that since 2003 is earlier than 2016, the answer is "NO" to the question of
        whether the first movie was released later than the second.

        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the dates are different,
        with The Crooked E being released in 2003 and Thoppil Joppan in 2016. The
        model says "No, The Crooked E (2003) was released earlier than Thoppil Joppan
        (2016)," indicating a clear difference in release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly indicates that "The Crooked E (2003) was released earlier
        than Thoppil Joppan (2016)" as the reason for this answer.

        that "The Crooked E" was released earlier (January 5, 2003) than "Thoppil
        Joppan" (October 7, 2016), which is the opposite of what was being asked.
        The model explicitly states "January 5, 2003, is earlier than October 7, 2016"
        and not that the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that "The Crooked E" was released earlier (January 5, 2003)
        than "Thoppil Joppan" (October 7, 2016), directly answering the comparative
        question of whether the first film was released later than the second.

        that "The Crooked E" was released in 2003 while "Thoppil Joppan" was released
        in 2016, and it explicitly states "The Crooked E was released *earlier* than
        Thoppil Joppan." The model identified a clear difference in release dates
        (2003 vs. 2016), not equality.

        explicitly noted that the years are different (2003 vs 1985) and stated that
        "2003 is later than 1985." The model's reasoning actually contradicts its
        final NO answer. Since the model did not claim the values are equal as the
        reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's reasoning concludes that "Since 2003 is
        later than 1985, the answer is yes." However, the final word of the response
        is "NO" which directly contradicts the reasoning. Since there is an explicit

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave NO because it determined that
        Parwana was released in 1971 and Android was released in 1982, and concluded
        that 1971 is not later than 1982. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in values (1971 vs 1982) rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. It explicitly concludes "NO, 1971 is not
        later than 1982" after comparing the release dates of the two movies.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the values are different (1971
        vs 1982) and that one is earlier than the other. The NO answer is given because
        Parwana was released earlier than Android, not because they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Parwana was released later than Android. The model
        explains that since Parwana was released in 1971 and Android in 1982, and
        1971 is earlier than 1982, Parwana was released earlier, not later.

        that Parwana was released in 1971 and Android in 1982, and determined that
        1971 is earlier than 1982. The model explicitly states "1971 is earlier than
        1982" as the reason for its NO answer, not because the release years are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Parwana was released later than Android. The model determined that
        Parwana was released in 1971 and Android in 1982, and since 1971 is earlier
        than 1982, it concluded with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies
        were released in different years (Parwana in 1971 and Android in 1982), and
        concludes that Parwana was released earlier than Android, not at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and this is consistent with its reasoning that "Parwana (1971) was released
        earlier than Android (1982)" when asked if Parwana was released later than
        Android.

        are different (1962 vs 1975) and that China Town was released earlier than
        Smoke in the Wind. The NO answer was given because the comparison "China Town
        was released later than Smoke in the Wind" does not hold true due to China
        Town being released earlier, not because the release dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which directly responds to the question of whether China Town was released
        later than Smoke in the Wind. The model determined that China Town (1962)

        reasoning is that Naukar Biwi Ka was released in 1983 while Kanave Kalayadhe
        was released in 2007, and since 1983 comes before 2007, the first film was
        not released later than the second.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Crimen was released in 1960
        and Satya Harishchandra was released in 1965, and concludes that "Since 1960
        is not later than 1965, the answer is no." The model is comparing different
        years (1960 vs 1965) and determining that one is earlier than the other, not
        that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question of whether Crimen was released later than Satya Harishchandra.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Crimen (1960) was released earlier than Satya Harishchandra (1965), not
        later. The model explicitly states "1960 is earlier than 1965" and not that
        they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Crimen was released
        in 1960 and Satya Harishchandra was released in 1965, and concluded that since
        1960 is earlier than 1965, Crimen was not released later than Satya Harishchandra.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1960 is earlier than 1965, indicating
        a clear difference between the release years. The NO answer is based on this
        difference (that Crimen was released earlier, not later than Satya Harishchandra),
        not on any equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Crimen (1960) was not released later than Satya Harishchandra
        (1965). The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing the release
        years.

        Crimen was released in 1960 and Satya Harishchandra was released in 1965,
        and 1960 is not later than 1965. The model is not saying the values are equal;
        it's saying that one value (1960) is earlier than the other (1965), which
        is why it answers NO to the question of whether Crimen was released later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Dostana was released in 1980 and Geetanjali in 1993, making Dostana earlier
        than Geetanjali (not later). The model explicitly states "1980 is earlier
        than 1993" and "Dostana was released earlier, not later, than Geetanjali."
        The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Dostana was released later than Geetanjali. The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it stated
        that 1952 (Heidi) is earlier than 1954 (L'Oro di Napoli), which means the
        release years are different. The model's NO is based on this difference in
        values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Heidi was released
        in 1952 and L'Oro di Napoli was released in 1954, and concluded that since
        1952 is earlier than 1954, the answer is "NO" to whether Heidi was released

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly answers the question of whether Luigi Comencini's
        Heidi was released later than Vittorio De Sica's L'Oro di Napoli. The model
        determined that Heidi (1952) was released earlier than L'Oro di Napoli (1954),
        not later, hence the "NO" answer.

        that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950 and "Sujata" was released in
        1959, and since 1950 is earlier than 1959, "Beware of Blondie" was not released
        later than "Sujata". The model explicitly states "1950 is earlier than 1959"
        as the reason for its NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly determined that "Beware of
        Blondie" (1950) was released before "Sujata" (1959), not later, and therefore
        answered "NO" to the question of whether the first film was released later

        was released in 1968, and concluded that since 1955 is earlier than 1968,
        the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that French
        Cancan was released in 1955 and OSS 117 - Double Agent was released in 1968,
        meaning French Cancan was released earlier, not later. The model did not state
        that the values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted that "1955 is
        earlier than 1968." The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that French
        Cancan (1955) was not released later than OSS 117 - Double Agent (1968).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1986 is earlier than 2002, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference (with "Playing
        for Keeps" being released earlier, not later than "Safe Conduct").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Playing for Keeps" was released later than "Safe Conduct". The

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986 and "Safe Conduct" was released
        in 2002, and since 1986 is earlier than 2002, "Playing for Keeps" was released
        earlier, not later than "Safe Conduct". The model explicitly notes a difference
        in values (1986 vs 2002), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Playing for Keeps" was released later than "Safe
        Conduct". The model determined that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986
        while "Safe Conduct" was released in 2002, and since 1986 is earlier than
        2002, it concluded with a definitive "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986, which is earlier than "Safe
        Conduct" which was released in 2002. The model explicitly states "1986 is
        earlier than 2002" as the reason for its NO answer, not because the values
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Playing for Keeps" was released later than "Safe
        Conduct". The model determined that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986
        and "Safe Conduct" was released in 2002, and concluded that since 1986 is
        earlier than 2002, the answer is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986 while "Safe Conduct" was released
        in 2002, meaning "Playing for Keeps" was released earlier, not later. The
        model explicitly states the values are different (1986 vs 2002) and this difference
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in both its conclusion and in the final one-word answer at the end of the
        response. The model determined that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986
        while "Safe Conduct" was released in 2002, and therefore concluded that "Playing
        for Keeps" was released earlier, not later.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "1986 is earlier than 2002" and
        concludes with "NO" because Playing for Keeps (1986) was released earlier,
        not later, than Safe Conduct (2002). The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two movies. This is a clear
        negative answer to the comparative question.

        for Keeps (1986) was released earlier than Safe Conduct (2002), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states "1986 is earlier than 2002"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear difference in values rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether "Playing for Keeps" was released later than "Safe
        Conduct". The model determined that Playing for Keeps (1986) was released
        earlier than Safe Conduct (2002), not later, and provided this explicit NO
        answer.

        (release years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were
        released in different years (1986 vs 2002) and that "2002 is later than 1986."
        The NO answer is given because the comparison showed the opposite of what
        was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bob Weinstein's Playing for Keeps was NOT released
        later than Bertrand Tavernier's Safe Conduct. The model provides a clear comparative
        answer after analyzing the release years.

        earlier than 2018, not equal to it. The NO answer is based on the fact that
        Phil the Alien was released earlier, not that the release dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. This is a direct answer to the comparative

        they were different (1996 vs 2006). The NO answer was based on the fact that
        one film was released earlier than the other, not because they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Ambition Without Honor was released later than
        Vitus. This is a clear comparative answer where the model determined that
        Ambition Without Honor (1996) was released earlier than Vitus (2006), not
        later.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different, not the same. Specifically, it determined
        that "The Solid Gold Cadillac" was released in 1956 while "The Knack" was
        released in 1965, and concluded that 1956 is earlier than 1965. The NO answer
        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that "The
        Solid Gold Cadillac" was released earlier (1956), not later, than "The Knack"
        (1965).

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1956 is earlier than 1965, indicating
        a clear difference between the release years. The NO answer is based on this
        difference (1956 being earlier than 1965), not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5 and reiterates it as a standalone answer at the end. The model is
        making a definitive comparative judgment that The Solid Gold Cadillac was
        not released later than The Knack... and How to Get It.

        that The Solid Gold Cadillac was released in 1956 while The Knack...and How
        to Get It was released in 1965, meaning the first movie was released earlier
        (not later) than the second movie. The model clearly identified different
        values (1956 vs 1965) and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that The Solid Gold Cadillac
