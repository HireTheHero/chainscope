        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the values are different (1997
        vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released before "Rock
        Slyde". The NO answer appears to be in response to a question about whether
        "Rock Slyde" was released before "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho".

        it stated that 1959 (Ragazzi del Juke-Box) is earlier than 1967 (Beach Red),
        which means the release years are different. The model concluded that Ragazzi
        del Juke-Box was released before Beach Red, not later.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined

        Phil the Alien (2004) was released earlier than Byomkesh Gotro (2018), and
