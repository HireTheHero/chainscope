      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the first movie was released in 1997 while the second was released in
        2009, and concluded that "1997 is not later than 2009. It is earlier." The
        model clearly identified a difference in values (1997 vs. 2009) as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        (1997) was released earlier than "Rock Slyde" (2009), not later, and explicitly
        concluded with "NO" at the end of its response.

        26, 1997 (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho) vs. April 20, 2009 (Rock Slyde)" and concludes
        that "2009 is later than 1997." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in dates, not on equality.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the movies
        were released at different times (1997 vs. 2009), with Rock Slyde being released
        later than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho. The NO answer was given because the chronological
        order is the opposite of what was asked in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after explaining that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (1997) was released earlier than
        Rock Slyde (2009), not later.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that 1997 is earlier than
        2009, showing a clear difference in the release dates. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after determining that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997, which is

        that 1997 is earlier than 2009, stating "1997 is *not* later than 2009. It
        is earlier." The model identified a clear difference between the values (1997
        vs 2009) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released

        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho (1997) was released earlier than Rock Slyde (2009), not later,
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether the first movie was
        released later than the second.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also explains that "No, 1971 is earlier than 1982" in step 6 of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that Parwana was released in 1971 and Android was released in 1982, concluding
        that "1971 is earlier than 1982, not later." The model identified a clear
        difference in values (1971 vs 1982) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies and determining that Parwana
        (1971) was released earlier than Android (1982), not later.

        (release dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "1971 (Parwana)
        is earlier than 1982 (Android)" and concludes "No, it was released earlier."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one date is earlier than the other,
        not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also explains "No, it was released earlier" when answering whether Parwana
        was released later than Android. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        explicitly states "1971 is earlier than 1982" and "No, it was released earlier."
        The model is indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Parwana was released later than Android. The model explicitly concludes
        with "NO" at the end of its response after explaining that Parwana (1971)
        was released earlier than Android (1982).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "1987 comes before 1998"
        and that "1987 is earlier than 1998." The model's NO answer is based on the
        fact that one date is earlier than the other, not that they are the same.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that one value is earlier than the other (1987 is earlier than 1998). The
        model explicitly states "Since 1987 is earlier than 1998, the statement is
        false." This indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that "Deewana Tere Naam
        Ka" (1987) was not released later than "Bingo" (1998), since 1987 is earlier
        than 1998.

        that 1987 is earlier than 1998, not later. The model explicitly states "1987
        is earlier than 1998" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear
        difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model determined
        that "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" (1987) was released earlier than "Bingo" (1998),
        not later, and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether the first
        movie was released later than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        first movie was released in 2002 while the second was released in 2016, meaning
        the first movie was earlier, not later than the second. The model did not
        state that the values were equal or the same - it explicitly noted they were
        different (2002 vs. 2016) and that one was earlier than the other.

        values being compared are the same - in fact, it explicitly noted that the
        dates are different (1992 vs 2007).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies. The model clearly concludes
        that "Alan & Naomi" was not released later than "The White Angel" because
        1992 is earlier than 2007.

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that 1955 is earlier than 1966, indicating
        a clear difference between the release dates. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on any equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The answer is bolded at the end
        of the response, and the model explains that "1955 is earlier than 1966" as
        the reasoning for this answer.

        of the Mutilated (1974)" and concludes that "1970 is earlier than 1974." The
        model is giving NO because one value is earlier than the other, not because
        they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        that Borsalino was released in 1970 and Shriek of the Mutilated was released
        in 1973, and determined that 1970 is earlier than 1973, not later. The model
        explicitly states "1970 came before 1973" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Borsalino was released
        in 1970 and Shriek of the Mutilated was released in 1973, and since 1970 came

        that Borsalino was released in 1970 while Shriek of the Mutilated was released
        in 1974, meaning Borsalino was released earlier, not later than Shriek of
        the Mutilated. The model explicitly states the values are different (1970
        vs 1974), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        indicating a difference between the values. The model says "No, it was earlier"
        which shows the reason for the NO is that one value precedes the other, not
        that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that 1982
        is earlier than 1988, not because the values are the same. The model explicitly
        states "No, 1982 is earlier than 1988" and concludes that the first movie
        was released "earlier" than the second movie. The values being compared (1982
        and 1988) are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        the dates are different (November 25, 2000 vs February 2, 2006) and that one
        date is earlier than the other. The NO answer is based on the fact that "Ambition
        Without Honor" was released earlier than "Vitus," not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Ambition Without
        Honor" was released in 2000 while "Vitus" was released in 2006, and concludes
        that since 2000 is earlier than 2006, the statement that "Ambition Without
