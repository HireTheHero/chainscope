    203ab2e1-60d7-4e0f-be80-1a275ea8ecc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, with "Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho" being released "approximately 12 years earlier." The model clearly
        indicates a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was NOT released later than
        "Rock Slyde". This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes
        that the first film came out earlier than the second. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. The model concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was NOT released later
        than "Rock Slyde" after comparing their release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 while "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, making the former earlier than the latter. The model did not state
        that the values (release dates) are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        noted they are different (1997 vs 2009).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ashim Samanta's "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was NOT released

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in
        different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes NO because "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released earlier than "Rock Slyde," not later. The model is clearly indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Ashim Samanta's "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was NOT released

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values

        that "The Three Faces" was released in 1965 and "Because of the Cats" was
        released in 1973, and since 1965 comes before 1973, the first film was released
        earlier, not later than the second film. The model explicitly notes a difference
        in values (1965 vs. 1973).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly compares the release dates of the two films, determines
        that "The Three Faces" (1965) was released earlier than "Because of the Cats"
        (1973), and concludes with "NO" to the question of whether the first film
        was released later than the second.

        in different years (1976 vs 1992) and concludes that "It Shouldn't Happen
        to a Vet" was released earlier, not at the same time. The NO answer is based
        on the first film being released before the second film, not because they
        were released at the same time.

        that "Be There or Be Square" was released in 1998 while "Edges of the Lord"
        was released in 2001, meaning the first film was released earlier, not later
        than the second film. The model explicitly states the values are different

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that "Be There or Be Square" was released in 1998,
        which is earlier than "Edges of the Lord" released in 2001, and therefore

        in different years (Parwana in 1971 and Android in 1982) and concludes that
        "Parwana was released earlier than Android, not later." The NO answer is based
        on the fact that one film came before the other, not that they were released
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Parwana was not released later than Android. The model provides

        be responding to whether "Up the Creek" was released earlier than "The Weekend
        Murders" (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "The Weekend Murders" was released 14 years EARLIER than

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model is answering the question "Was Lew Landers's 'When the Redskins
        Rode' released later than Chuck Jones's 'Baby Buggy Bunny'?" with a clear
        "NO" after determining that "Baby Buggy Bunny" (1954) came out after "When
        the Redskins Rode" (1951).

        Flower" was released in 1952 while "Ice Cold in Alex" was released in 1958,
        making the former earlier than the latter. The model explicitly states "1952
        (The Scarlet Flower) comes before 1958 (Ice Cold in Alex)" and concludes that
        "The Scarlet Flower" was released EARLIER, not later. The values are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that "The Scarlet Flower" was not released later than
        "Ice Cold in Alex." The model clearly provides a comparative answer with "NO"
        as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "We're No Angels" was released in 1989 while "waydowntown" was released
        in 2000, meaning the first film was released EARLIER than the second film.
        The model explicitly states this difference in values as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Neil Jordan's We're No Angels released later than Gary
        Burns's waydowntown?" The model clearly determined that "We're No Angels"
        was released in 1989 while "waydowntown" was released in 2000, and concluded
        that the former was released earlier, not later than the latter.

        a Convent" was released in 1979 while "Perfect Exchange" was released in 1993,
        and concludes that "Images in a Convent" was released earlier than "Perfect
        Exchange," not later. The model is noting a difference in values (1979 vs

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950, which is earlier than "Sujata"
        (1959), not later. The model explicitly states the values are different (1950
        vs 1959) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" in its
        final conclusion. It determines that "Beware of Blondie" was released in 1950
        and "Sujata" was released in 1959, and concludes that since "Beware of Blondie"
        was released earlier than "Sujata," not later, the answer is NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Beware
        of Blondie" was released in 1950 and "Sujata" was released in 1959, making
        "Beware of Blondie" earlier, not later than "Sujata". The model explicitly
        states "1950 (Beware of Blondie) is earlier than 1959 (Sujata)" as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values being compared (the release years) are not equal,
        but different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes
        that "Beware of Blondie" was not released later than "Sujata" because 1950
        is earlier than 1959.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, the model's reasoning indicates it cannot confirm the existence
        or release date of Nambirajan's Chandralekha, which means it cannot make a
        proper comparison. The model is essentially saying "NO, but I cannot verify
        one of these films." This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model
        rejects the premises of the question or indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        that "Playing for Keeps" was released in 1986 while "Safe Conduct" was released
        in 2002, making the former earlier than the latter. The model explicitly states
        "Since 1986 comes before 2002, 'Playing for Keeps' was released EARLIER than
        'Safe Conduct,' not later." This indicates different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Bob Weinstein's Playing for Keeps released later than

        concludes that the first film was released "6 years earlier" than the second
        film. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Farz Aur Kaanoon"
        was not released later than "The Eighth Happiness" and provides specific dates
        to support this conclusion.
