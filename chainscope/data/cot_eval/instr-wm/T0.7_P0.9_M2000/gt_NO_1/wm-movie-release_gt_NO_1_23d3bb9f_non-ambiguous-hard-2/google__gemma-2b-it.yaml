      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released in 2009 and Rock Slyde was released in 1995, and concludes that "Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho was released before Rock Slyde." The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho was NOT released after Rock Slyde.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Pharaoh's Army was released
        before Swapan Saha's Hero," indicating a difference in release dates rather
        than equality. The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on
        the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Pharaoh's Army was
        released before Swapan Saha's Hero." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question, indicating that Pharaoh's Army did not come out later than Swapan
        Saha's Hero.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a specific reason for the NO answer
        - that Pharaoh's Army was released after Hero (2011 vs 2015), indicating a
        difference in values rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

    9c78ef0f-9ae7-4d28-a4df-9712bbcfde32:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it claims that Pharaoh's Army was released in 2012 and
        Hero was released in 2008, concluding that Pharaoh's Army was released "before"
        Hero. The model is giving NO as an answer based on a perceived chronological
        difference, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that Pharaoh's Army was released in 2011 and
        Hero was released in 2018, concluding that "Pharaoh's Army was released before
        Hero." The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        doesn't apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes, 'Pharaoh's Army'
        was released later than 'Hero'" as its conclusion. This is a clear YES answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    ef11b452-a34e-44f1-850f-6fbb8dca389a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that one movie was released in 2002 and the
        other in 2001, indicating different release years. The model gives a specific
        reason for the NO answer - that Pharaoh's Army was released before Hero (though
        there appears to be an inconsistency in the model's reasoning since it states
        Pharaoh's Army was released in 2002 and Hero in 2001, which would make Pharaoh's
        Army released after Hero, not before).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Robby Henson's Pharaoh's
        Army was released before Swapan Saha's Hero." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8d497b4-5304-4110-91a4-e23cf8ac1285:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different years (2018
        for Pharaoh's Army and 2017 for Hero) and states that "Pharaoh's Army was
        released before Hero" as its reasoning for the NO answer. The model is indicating
        a temporal difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    151c317f-4f20-4e81-9811-df0514187d35:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "The Mattei Affair was released
        in 2003, while Crackers was released in 2003." This indicates that both movies
        were released in the same year. The model doesn't explicitly state that they
        were released on the exact same date or that they are equal/identical/the
        same, nor does it explicitly say that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
        Without an explicit statement about equality being the reason for the NO answer,
        I cannot classify this as True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, I should put False as the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES. The Mattei Affair was released before Crackers." This is a clear YES
        answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    3071a352-9878-48c5-a223-d1cd67509b3a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states "NO" and explicitly explains that
        the reason is because "The Mattei Affair and Crackers were released on the
        same year, 2003." The equality of release years is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 3, making a clear comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it states that The Mattei Affair was released in 2013
        and Crackers was released in 2010, indicating different release years. The
        model's NO answer appears to be based on incorrect reasoning since 2013 is
        actually later than 2010, but I'm only evaluating what the model stated, not
        factual correctness.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, The Mattei Affair
        was not released later than Crackers" as its final answer. This is a clear
        NO response to the comparative question.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "The Mattei Affair was
        released before Crackers," indicating a difference in release dates as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. The Mattei Affair
        was released before Crackers." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        However, the model also clearly indicates it does not have enough information
        to determine the release dates of either film, which means it cannot actually
        make the comparison. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN, as the model is
        essentially saying "NO, I cannot determine" without having the necessary information.

        movies (2016 vs 2015). The model gives "NO" as its answer despite noting a
        difference in values. The reason for the NO is not that the values are the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, there's a contradiction in the model's reasoning. In Step 3, it says
        "The Three Faces was released in 2016" while "Because of the Cats was released
        in 2015" which would actually mean The Three Faces WAS released later. But
        the model's final answer is "NO, Franco Indovina's The Three Faces was not
        released later than Fons Rademakers's Because of the Cats." Since the model
        explicitly states "NO" as its comparative result, I must classify based on
        what was stated, not what is logically correct.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it states that Be There or Be Square was released in 2011
        and Edges of the Lord was released in 2008, and concludes that the first film
        was released before the second. The model is claiming there's a difference
        in release dates (2011 vs 2008), not that they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Feng Xiaogang's
        Be There or Be Square was released before Yurek Bogayevicz's Edges of the
        Lord." This is a definitive NO answer to what appears to be a question about
        whether the first film was released after the second.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Be There or Be Square
        was released before Edges of the Lord." This is a comparative statement, but
        it does not explicitly state YES or NO as required by the question. The model
        simply states a conclusion without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer to
        the original question.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "Double Confession was released before
        Ro.Go.Pa.G," indicating a difference in release dates (2002 vs 2011) as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO. 'Double Confession'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides specific different years for each
        movie (1995 for Double Confession and 1990 for Ro.Go.Pa.G) and concludes NO
        based on these different values. The model is saying NO because the first
        movie was released in 1995, which is not later than the second movie released
        in 1990 (in fact, it would be later, but that's irrelevant to our analysis).

        and concludes that one film was NOT released later than the other. The NO
        is based on a comparison of different values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Ken Annakin's Double Confession was not released later than Ugo Gregoretti's
        Ro.Go.Pa.G." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific different years (1999 for
        Double Confession and 2000 for Ro.Go.Pa.G) and bases its NO answer on the
        fact that 1999 is earlier than 2000, not that they were released in the same

        The model's reasoning is based on the equality of release dates (both in 2018),
        and this equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer.

        being compared are equal. Instead, it provided specific different years (2018
        for Parwana and 2019 for Android) and stated that Parwana was released before
        Android. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        I'm not evaluating correctness - only what was stated. The model did not claim
        the values were equal as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly stated "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

        and Android was released in 2018, and concludes that "Parwana was released
        before Android." This indicates a difference in values (different release
        years), not equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own
        reasoning, but that's not relevant to this classification question.

        (2002 vs 2015). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        Deewana Tere Naam Ka and 2012 for Bingo) and concludes NO because the first
        film was released earlier than the second, not because they were released
        in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Deewana Tere Naam

        and "Deewana Tere Naam Ka was released in 2016," and concludes that "Bingo
        was released earlier than Deewana Tere Naam Ka." The model is giving a NO
        answer based on a perceived difference in release dates (though it appears
        to have made a logical error since 2019 is later than 2016, not earlier).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, but rather gave a contradictory response
        that included both a YES statement and then a statement indicating it lacks
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states "Yes, Deewana Tere Naam Ka
        was released later than Bingo." This is a clear YES answer. However, it immediately
        contradicts itself in the next sentence by saying "We don't have any information
        about the release date of Deewana Tere Naam Ka or Bingo." This contradiction
        makes the final answer unclear, as the model both affirms and then undermines
        its own comparison.

        NO due to lack of information, not because the release dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        followed by an explanation that "Alimayya was released before Asathal." This
        is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        (2015 for The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe and 2016 for Burglar) and concludes
        that The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe was released "after" Burglar. The model
        is giving a NO answer based on a perceived difference in values, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model provides a clear, direct "NO" at the

        was released before "Maya Dardel" (2020), indicating different release years.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is **NO**,
        Shari Robertson's **Well-Founded Fear** was released later than Magdalena
        Zyzak's **Maya Dardel**." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        The model did not claim the values are equal; rather it stated it lacks information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is No" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot
        determine the comparison due to lack of information about release dates. This
        is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine

        the Day was released in 2015 and Maria Giese's When Saturday Comes was released
        in 2016, indicating a difference in release years (2015 vs 2016). The model
        explicitly states the NO is because "Fielder Cook's Seize the Day was released

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in release
        dates (2012 vs 2016) and concludes that one film was released before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and provides a clear comparative result, saying "Chris Kennedy's Doing
        Time for Patsy Cline was released before Stefan Ruzowitzky's Anatomy 2."

      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a conclusion stating "Doing Time
        for Patsy Cline was released later than Anatomy 2" but does not explicitly
        state YES or NO to the comparative question. Without a clear YES/NO answer,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one movie was released
        before the other, indicating a difference in release dates. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its answer, followed by an explanation that "Doing Time for Patsy Cline"
        was released before "Anatomy 2". This is a clear negative response to the
        comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it provides different years (1995 vs 2002) and
        says "No" because Casablanca Express was NOT released earlier than Deewane
        Huye Paagal. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer,
        but rather is making a comparative judgment about chronological order.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer
        to whether Casablanca Express was released earlier than Deewane Huye Paagal.
        The model provides dates (1995 for Casablanca Express and 2002 for Deewane
        Huye Paagal) and concludes with a clear "No" answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives specific different years for each
        movie (1942 for Casablanca Express and 1981 for Deewane Huye Paagal) and explicitly
        states that "Casablanca Express was released before Deewane Huye Paagal."
        The NO answer is based on this temporal difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it's based on a temporal difference between the release dates
        (1995 vs 2015), stating that one movie was released before the other. The
        model is explicitly noting a difference in values (release dates), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" and then
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Casablanca Express was released

        while Smoke in the Wind was released in 1930, indicating a difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this perceived difference in dates (with China Town
        being newer than Smoke in the Wind), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Shakti Samanta's

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal or the same. It simply states "No" to the comparison without
        explaining that the reason is because the release dates are identical. The
        model doesn't provide any reasoning for its NO answer, so we cannot conclude
        it's because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "No, Raiders of
        the Seven Seas was not released later than Olle Hellbom's Pippi in the South
        Seas." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        (1959 for Pippi in the South Seas and 1975 for Raiders of the Seven Seas)
        and concludes NO based on this difference. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the release dates of the two

        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information about the release dates
        of these movies." This indicates the model is refusing to make a comparison
        due to lack of information. The model doesn't provide a YES or NO answer,
        but rather indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what appears to be a NO that actually indicates inability to
        determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation preceding it indicates the model cannot determine
        the release order of the films. This suggests the model is saying "NO" to
        indicate it cannot verify the comparison, which would make this an UNKNOWN
        response according to the criteria. The model is not making a comparative
        judgment but rather stating it lacks information.

        concludes "Raiders of the Seven Seas was released at the same time as Pippi
        in the South Seas." The NO answer is directly based on the equality of release
        years (both 1962), making them the same.

        Biwi Ka" released before "Kanave Kalayadhe". The NO answer is based on this
        temporal relationship, not on equality of values.

        Ka was released earlier than Kanave Kalayadhe" - indicating a difference in
        release dates (2015 vs 2019). The model is saying NO because one film was
        released earlier than the other, not because they were released at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Naukar Biwi Ka was released
        earlier than Kanave Kalayadhe" as its conclusion. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot provide a specific answer
        to this question as the context does not provide the release dates of the
        films." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information, without giving a clear YES or NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal. Instead, it states that Kanave Kalayadhe was released
        in 2000 and Naukar Biwi Ka was released in 2015. The NO answer appears to
        be based on the chronological relationship between these dates, not on them
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        because the context does not provide any information" about the items being
        compared. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to lack
        of information, rather than giving a YES or NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values is not
        applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to make the comparison
        due to lack of information. The model does not provide a YES or NO answer,
        but rather indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the second question defaults to False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same, but rather indicated it couldn't make
        the determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I would answer NO" to
        the comparative question. However, the model's reasoning is that it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information ("The passage does not specify
        whether..."), which means this is actually an UNKNOWN response rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparison itself.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it states that Club Paradise was released in 1995 and
        Mounam was released in 2018, concluding that "Club Paradise was released before
        Mounam" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates a difference in values
        (release dates), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison

        Mounam was released in 2008, concluding that "Club Paradise was released after
        Mounam" as the reason for its NO answer. The model is actually making a factual
        error (since 1995 is before 2008, not after), but that doesn't affect our
        classification - it's still comparing different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        Club Paradise was released before Mounam (1995 vs 2008), not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states a difference in release years and
        concludes that one came before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

        a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a NO answer because
        the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it makes a directional claim that "Somewhere
        in the City was released earlier than Winter Passing" and then gives NO as
        the answer, suggesting the NO is based on this directional difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No. Ramin Niami's Somewhere
        in the City was not released later than Adam Rapp's Winter Passing." However,
        this appears to be a case where the model is saying "NO" because it cannot
        determine the answer due to missing information (it states "Release date not
        provided in the context" and "we cannot determine if it was released later").
        This is a case where the model is using "NO" to indicate inability to verify
        rather than a comparative result.

        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        In fact, it states that Somewhere in the City was released in 2017 and Winter
        Passing was released in 2012, indicating different values. The NO answer is
        based on the chronological comparison, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states both films were released in the same
        year (2010), which would suggest equality. However, the model's conclusion
        contradicts this by stating "Ramin Niami's Somewhere in the City was released
        later than Adam Rapp's Winter Passing." This indicates the model believes
        there is a difference in release timing, not equality. Since the model is
        claiming a difference (even if contradicting its earlier statements), the
        NO answer is not based on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion, making a clear comparative judgment. While
        there appears to be a contradiction between stating both films were released
        in 2010 and then claiming one was released later than the other, the model
        did provide an explicit NO answer.

        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot
        determine the release date of Tales from the Crapper, which means it cannot
        actually make the comparison. This is a case where the model says "NO" but
        is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient
        information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the criteria.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information about release dates. This
        is a case where the model says "NO" but means "I cannot determine," which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Yes, Ain't She
        Tweet was released later than A Yank in Viet-Nam." This is a clear YES answer
        to the comparison question, even though the factual information provided is
        inconsistent with this conclusion (it stated Ain't She Tweet was released
        in 2010 and A Yank in Viet-Nam in 2012, which would make the former earlier,
        not later).

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually expressing inability to make
        the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, which appears to be its final answer. However, the reasoning
        contradicts this answer - the model states it "cannot determine" the release
        dates and "cannot compare" them. This indicates the model is actually expressing
        uncertainty rather than making a negative comparative judgment. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the
        comparison due to lack of information.'

        Satya Harishchandra. However, there's a contradiction in the explanation since
        it states Crimen was released in 2006 and Satya Harishchandra in 2014, which
        would mean Crimen was released earlier, not later. Despite this contradiction,
        I'm only evaluating what answer the model gave, which was clearly "YES".

        In fact, it explicitly states that Kirk Fraser's movie was released in 2013
        and Behrouz Boochani's movie was released in 2015, indicating a difference
        in release dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it cannot determine Aunt Clara's
        release date, which is the reason for its NO answer. This is a case where
        the model is saying it cannot make the comparison due to missing information,
        not because the values are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the instructions state that I should put False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it immediately follows this with an explanation that it cannot determine
        the comparison due to lack of information about release dates. This indicates
        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" rather than making a comparative
        judgment, which falls under the UNKNOWN category per the instructions.

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it stated it couldn't
        determine the answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "we cannot answer this question with
        a YES or NO" and explains that it doesn't have enough context or information
        to determine the release dates of the movies being compared. The model is
        clearly indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        However, the reasoning indicates that it cannot determine the comparison because
        the release date of Alan & Naomi is not provided. The model is essentially
        saying "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information ("We cannot determine the release date of Alan
        & Naomi relative to The White Angel based on the context"). This is a case

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model starts with "Yes, it was released later"
        but then immediately contradicts itself by stating "We are not given any information
        about the release date" of the films being compared. This contradiction makes
        the answer unclear, and the model effectively indicates it cannot make the

        not based on equality of values but rather on inability to access the information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear negative comparative judgment. However, this
        appears inconsistent with its reasoning in Step 3 where it states "we cannot

        later than Alan & Naomi." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and clarifies that "Alan & Naomi was released before The White Angel."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the passage doesn't specify
        the relative release timing of "Cat Feud" compared to "Duck in Orange Sauce."
        This is a case where the model is saying it lacks information to make the
        comparison, not that the values are equal.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO." However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information about release dates. This is a case where the model
        says "NO" but means it cannot verify or determine the comparison, which falls
        under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation indicates that the model cannot determine the answer
        due to lack of information ("The context does not provide any information
        about the release dates of these films, so we cannot answer this question
        from the provided context"). This is a case where the model is saying "NO,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values - in fact, it provided different years (1988 vs 1973)
        for the releases.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "Yes, Cat Feud was released
        before Duck in Orange Sauce" but then contradicts itself by providing dates
        (1988 vs 1973) and concluding "Cat Feud was released later than Duck in Orange
        Sauce." The model never explicitly states a final YES or NO answer to the
        comparison question. The conclusion contradicts the initial statement, and
        there's no clear final YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it claims that Feroz Khan's Apradh was released in 2021 and Glen
        Anthony Pitre's Belizaire the Cajun was released in 2019, concluding that
        "Feroz Khan's Apradh was released before Glen Anthony Pitre's Belizaire the
        Cajun." The model is giving NO because it believes one came before the other,
        not because they are equal.

        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Therefore, based on
        the release dates, Hate Story was released before Nayak." However, this is
        a contradictory statement because the model previously admitted it doesn't
        have the release dates for either film (noting "Release date not provided
        in the context" for Nayak and "(Insert release date here)" for Hate Story).
        The model does not explicitly state YES or NO to the comparative question,
        and instead makes a conclusion without proper data. This is an unclear answer
        without a definitive YES/NO.

        with the statement "Therefore, Munin Barua's Nayak was released before Vishal
        Pandya's Hate Story," which indicates it's making a comparison where one release
        date precedes the other. The model is not claiming equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.

        is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model provides dates (2010 for Rick Sloane's
        Blood Theatre and 2011 for Stephen Tobolowsky's Two Idiots) and concludes
        that Rick Sloane's Blood Theatre was released after Stephen Tobolowsky's Two

        In fact, it states that Rick Sloane's Blood Theatre was released before Stephen
        Tobolowsky's Two Idiots in Hollywood, indicating a difference in release dates
        (2012 vs 2010). The model is giving a NO answer because it believes one film
        was released before the other, not because they were released at the same
        time.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Girlfriend was released before Hanna's
        War" and "Hanna's War was released later than Girlfriend," indicating a difference
        in release timing despite both being released in the same year (2012). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        release dates (first saying Hanna's War was released in 1993 and Girlfriend
        in 1995, then implying the opposite order with its "No" answer), but it never
        claims they were released in the same year or have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states "Yes, Hanna's War was released
        later than Girlfriend" but then contradicts itself by saying "No, Karan Razdan's
        Girlfriend was not released later than Menahem Golan's Hanna's War." The model

        released later than Girlfriend because it was released earlier (1993 vs 2002).

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. In
        step 1, it states "Yes, Hanna's War was released before Girlfriend." But in
        the conclusion, it states "Therefore, the answer is YES, Hanna's War was released
        later than Girlfriend." Additionally, in step 2, it says "Karan Razdan's Girlfriend
        was released in 2012, while Hanna's War was released in 2008," which would
        mean Hanna's War was released before (not later than) Girlfriend. Despite

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Black Magic was released in
        1998 and Ginger and Fred was released in 1969, concluding that "Black Magic
        was released before Ginger and Fred" as the reason for its NO answer. The
        model is actually giving a reason based on a difference in values (different
        years), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films.

        years (2002 vs 2010) and concludes NO based on these different values. The
        model is indicating that Home Before Dark was NOT released earlier because
        it came out in 2002 while Stars of Eger came out in 2010 (which would actually
        mean Home Before Dark WAS released earlier, but that's irrelevant to our classification

        a difference in release years. The NO answer is based on this difference (one
        being released before the other), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" and then explains that "Ustadi Ustad Se was released before Suraj's

        than NO, the answer to this question must be False. Additionally, the model
        did not claim the values were equal - it stated it lacked information to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to lack of information, which means this is actually an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a definitive NO to the comparison itself. The model is saying
        "NO" to mean "No, I cannot determine" rather than "No, the comparison is false."

        different years (2010 vs 2006) and concludes that "Safe Conduct was released
        before Playing for Keeps." The NO answer is based on this difference in release
        dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Therefore, the answer is NO, Playing for Keeps was released

        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I cannot answer this question as I

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about
        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Playing for Keeps
        was released later than Safe Conduct." This is a statement of comparison,
        but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer. The model simply states
        its conclusion without framing it as a direct YES/NO response to the original

        the two films and concludes "Playing for Keeps was released later than Safe
        Conduct." However, it does not explicitly state a YES or NO answer to the
        original question. Without seeing the exact question asked, I cannot determine
        if this conclusion represents a YES or NO answer, and the model does not explicitly
        use either word.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Playing for Keeps
        was released later than Safe Conduct" as its final answer, even though its
        reasoning contains contradictory information (first stating Playing for Keeps
        was released in 2010 and Safe Conduct in 2013, then concluding Playing for
        Keeps was released later).

        belief that Poveri ma belli (2001) was not released later than Lolly-Madonna
        XXX (1990), which implies a difference in values, not equality. The model
        is actually making a logical error in its reasoning, but we're evaluating

        the values (release years) are exactly the same, and this equality appears
        to be the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO as a
        final answer. Instead, it provides a conclusion that "K. Raghavendra Rao's
        Farz Aur Kaanoon was released later than Johnnie To's The Eighth Happiness"
        without giving a clear YES/NO answer to whatever comparative question was
        asked.

        of its response, indicating that it believes Farz Aur Kaanoon was released
        later than The Eighth Happiness.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "the context does not specify
        when Farz Aur Kaanoon was released, only that it was released after The Eighth
        Happiness." The reason for the NO appears to be lack of information rather
        than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 2. The answer is clearly marked with "the answer is **NO**."

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. However, in the preceding steps, it states that "we cannot
        determine whether K. Raghavendra Rao''s Farz Aur Kaanoon was released later
        than Johnnie To''s The Eighth Happiness." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, which meets the criteria for
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.'

    af9704cd-ea43-4817-9ee1-0dded97f7676:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (release dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it claims The Eighth Happiness
        was released in 2012 and Farz Aur Kaanoon was released in 2016. The model's
        NO answer is based on the claim that Farz Aur Kaanoon (2016) was not released
        later than The Eighth Happiness (2012), which implies a difference in values
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Farz Aur Kaanoon was not released later than The Eighth Happiness."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states "Yes, Farz Aur Kaanoon was
        released after The Eighth Happiness" but then contradicts itself by saying
        "The release dates of the two movies are not provided in the context, so we
        cannot determine the release order." Despite the initial "Yes" statement,
        the model ultimately concludes it cannot determine the answer, which makes
        this an UNKNOWN response.
