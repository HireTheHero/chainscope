      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the release
        years are different (1997 vs 2009) and concluded that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        released earlier than Rock Slyde, not later. The NO answer was based on a
        clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" at the
        end of its response, indicating that Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was not released later
        than Rock Slyde. This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "*Ankhon Mein Tum Ho* (1999)
        was released **earlier** than *Rock Slyde* (2009)." The NO answer is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (1997)
        was released earlier than Rock Slyde (2009)" and "1997 is earlier than 2009."
        The NO answer is based on the fact that one movie was released earlier than
        the other, not that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Ashim Samanta's Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho was not released later than Chris Dowling's Rock Slyde." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "1998 is earlier
        than 2009" - indicating a clear difference between the release dates. The
        model's reasoning is that one movie was released before the other, not that
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Ashim Samanta''s "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was

        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho (1999) was released earlier than Rock Slyde (2009)" - indicating a
        difference in values (release dates), not equality. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in release dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        dates) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was
        not released later than Rock Slyde; it was released earlier." The NO answer
        is based on one movie being released earlier than the other, not on equal
        release dates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        30, 1999) was released earlier than Rock Slyde (March 27, 2009)." The NO answer
        is based on the fact that one film was released earlier than the other, not
        that they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it clearly identifies a difference in release dates (1999
        vs. 2009) and states that "Rock Slyde was released after Ankhon Mein Tum Ho."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the release dates are different (1999 vs 2009), with Ankhon Mein Tum
        Ho being released earlier than Rock Slyde. The model explicitly states "Since
        1999 is earlier than 2009, Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released before Rock Slyde."
        This indicates a clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question, indicating
        that Rock Slyde was not released before Ankhon Mein Tum Ho. The model determined

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that 1995 (Pharaoh's Army) is
        earlier than 2003 (Hero), showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in release years, not on equality.

        released earlier than Hero (1997)" - indicating a clear difference in values
        (1995 vs 1997), not equality. The NO is based on this difference in release
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, the answer is **NO**,
        Robby Henson's *Pharaoh's Army* was not released later than Swapan Saha's

        than the other (1965 vs. 1973), indicating a clear difference in release years.

        Instead, it explicitly states that "The Three Faces (1965) was released earlier
        than Because of the Cats (1973)" and concludes NO based on this difference
        in release years (1965 vs 1973). The model is saying NO because one film was
        released earlier than the other, not because they were released in the same
        year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Thus, NO, Franco Indovina's

        of release years. The model explicitly states "Both movies were released in
        the same year, 1976" and concludes that because they were released in the
        same year, one cannot be considered later than the other. The equality of
        release years is the primary reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question of whether "It
        Shouldn't Happen to a Vet" was released later than "The Real Story of Happy
        Birthday to You".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Goin'
        South was released earlier (1978) than La Balance (1982), not because the
        values were equal. The model clearly identified a difference in release years
        and based its NO answer on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Goin' South was released
        in 1978 and La Balance was released in 1982, concluding that Goin' South was
        released earlier, not later.
