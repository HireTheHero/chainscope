      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released before "Rock Slyde". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Given the question asks
        if 'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' was released later than 'Rock Slyde', the answer is
        NO." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        that "Pharaoh's Army" (1995) was released EARLIER than "Hero" (2006), not
        later. The model explicitly notes a difference in values (1995 vs 2006), not
        equality.

        to whether Robby Henson's "Pharaoh's Army" was released later than Swapan
        Saha's "Hero". The model provides specific years (1995 vs 2006) and concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that the
        movies were released in different years (1995 for "Pharaoh's Army" and 1983
        for "Hero"). The model's reasoning indicates a temporal difference between
        the releases, not equality. Even though there's a contradiction between the
        reasoning and the final answer, the model clearly did not base its NO answer
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. However, this appears to be a contradiction with
        its own reasoning. In step 3, the model states "Since 1983 is earlier than
        1995, 'Hero' was released before 'Pharaoh's Army'" which would logically mean
        "Pharaoh's Army" WAS released later than "Hero". Despite this contradiction,
        I must classify based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer, which
        was "NO".

        values being compared (release years) are different, not because they are
        the same. Specifically, it determined that 1946 is earlier than 1992, which
        is why it answered NO to whether the first movie was released later than the
        second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        vs 1982) and concludes that "Parwana was released before Android." The NO
        answer is given because one movie was released earlier than the other, not
        because they were released in the same year.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values (release years)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly stated that the movies were released in
        different years - "Club Paradise" in 1986 and "Mounam" in 1970. The model
        noted "Since 1970 is earlier than 1986, 'Mounam' was released before 'Club
        Paradise'." The model gave NO as its final answer, but not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Given the question
        asks if 'Club Paradise' was released later than 'Mounam', the answer is NO."
        This is confusing because the model first establishes that "Mounam" (1970)
        was released before "Club Paradise" (1986), which would mean "Club Paradise"
        was released later. The model's reasoning and conclusion contradict each other.
        However, I'm only evaluating what the model explicitly stated as its final
        answer, which is "NO" - not whether this answer is correct or consistent with
        its reasoning.

        it states that "Crimen" was released in 1960 and "Satya Harishchandra" was
        released in 1965, and concludes that "1960 is earlier than 1965." The NO answer
        is based on this difference in release years.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly indicates that "Crimen" was
        released in 1960, which is earlier than "Satya Harishchandra" which was released
        in 1965, and therefore concludes with a definitive "NO" answer.

        Se was released in 1982 and Suraj's Moovendhar was released in 1998, and concludes
        NO because 1998 is later than 1982, indicating a difference in values.

        is earlier than the other, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Given the question asks

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it determined
        that both movies were released in the same year (2006). The model explicitly
        states "Since both movies were released in the same year, 2006, they were
        released at the same time" and this equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the movies were released in different years (1956 vs 1965), with "The
        Solid Gold Cadillac" being released earlier. The model explicitly states the
        difference in release years as the reason for its answer.
