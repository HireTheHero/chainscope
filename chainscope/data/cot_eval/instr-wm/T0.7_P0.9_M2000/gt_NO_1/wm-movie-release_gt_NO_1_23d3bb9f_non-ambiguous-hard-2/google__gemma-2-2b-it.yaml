      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was classified as UNKNOWN, not NO,
        so according to the instructions, this should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question
        with a YES or NO" and indicates it doesn't have access to the information
        needed to make the comparison (movie release dates). This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared (presumably the release dates of the films) are equal or the
        same. In fact, the model doesn't provide any comparison of the release dates
        at all, despite saying it needs to compare them. Since the model doesn't claim
        the values are equal as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, while the model sets up a comparison
        between the two films and their directors, it doesn't actually complete the
        comparison or provide reasoning for the "NO" answer. It mentions that "we
        need to compare the release dates of these films" but then immediately gives

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually indicating that it cannot determine the answer due to lack
        of information about release dates. The model says "Without knowing the specific
        release dates of these films, we cannot definitively say whether 'Cat Feud'
        was released later than 'Duck in Orange Sauce.'" and then adds "We need more
        information to answer this question definitively." This is a case where the
        model is using "NO" to mean it cannot verify or determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values
        is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I need more information to answer
        this" and asks for release dates, indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information. It does not provide a YES or NO answer, nor
        does it explicitly refuse to answer. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make a determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot access real-time
        information, including movie release dates" and suggests that the user would
        need to do research to find the answer. This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        the question about whether the model gave a NO answer because the values are
        the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to find the answer
        (find release dates, compare them, determine the answer) but did not actually
        execute these steps or reach a conclusion. The model offered to help find
        the release dates but did not provide a final comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question
        about whether it gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response is "I need more information to
        answer this question. Please provide the release dates for both films." This
        indicates the model is refusing to provide a comparative answer because it
        lacks the necessary information. It's not giving a YES or NO answer, but rather
        stating it cannot make the determination without additional data.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response indicates it cannot make the
        comparison without additional information (release dates). It doesn't provide
        a clear YES/NO answer, and effectively states it cannot determine the answer
        without more data.

        (the model stated "We cannot determine"), this automatically results in False
        for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "We cannot determine"
        because it states it lacks the release dates needed to make the comparison.

        to the comparative question. It explains who the directors are and what the
        titles refer to, but explicitly states it cannot access information to determine
        release dates. The model doesn't make a definitive comparison or refuse to

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It simply breaks down the question, identifies
        what information would be needed (release dates), and offers to help find
        those dates. Since there is no explicit comparative conclusion, this is classified
        as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps for the user to follow
        to determine the answer themselves, suggesting they look up release dates
        and compare them. The model did not make a determination or refuse to answer
        - it simply deferred the answer pending more information from the user.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model didn't give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer
        based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlines steps to find the answer (identify
        directors, find release dates, compare them) but doesn't actually complete
        these steps or reach a conclusion. The model ends by offering help to find
        the release dates, indicating it hasn't made the comparison.

        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it explains what information would be
        needed to answer the question (the release dates of both films) and suggests
        that the user would need to research this information. The model explicitly
        states "you'll need to find the release dates for each movie" and "Let me
        know if you need help finding the release dates!" indicating it has not made
        a determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to find the answer (look
        up release dates and compare them) but did not actually provide a conclusion.
        The model even offers to help find the release dates, indicating it hasn't
        completed the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlines steps for the user to find
        the information themselves, saying "Let me know the results of your research
        and I can give you the answer!" This indicates the model is not providing
        a definitive answer.

        the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it outlined steps to solve the problem
        and ended by saying "Let me know when you've found the release dates and I
        can help you determine..." This indicates the model did not complete the comparison
        and is waiting for more information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer" after noting it can't find specific release dates for the movies.
        This indicates the model is refusing to make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (identify
        release dates and compare them) but did not actually execute these steps or

        needed (release dates) to make the comparison, and states "I can't give you
        specific release dates without searching for that information." The model
        essentially indicates it cannot determine which movie was released later without
        additional information.
