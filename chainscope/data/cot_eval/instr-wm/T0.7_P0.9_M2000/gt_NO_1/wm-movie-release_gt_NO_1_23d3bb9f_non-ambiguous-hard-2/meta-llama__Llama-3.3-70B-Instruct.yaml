      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes
        that "Since 1997 is earlier than 2009, 'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' was released before
        'Rock Slyde'." The NO answer is based on the fact that one movie was released
        before the other, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether 'Ankhon Mein Tum Ho' was released later than 'Rock Slyde' is NO."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho"
        was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released earlier than "Rock Slyde". The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than "Rock Slyde". The
        model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released
        in 2009, concluding that the first movie was released earlier than the second
        movie (not later). The model explicitly states "1997 is earlier than 2009"
        and not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the films were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes that "Rock Slyde" was released
        later than "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho". The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (release
        years) are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released
        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes NO because "Rock Slyde was
        released later than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" - indicating a clear difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Ashim
        Samanta's Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released later than Chris Dowling's Rock
        Slyde is NO" at the end of its response. This is an explicit NO answer to

        in different years (1997 vs 2009) and that "1997 is earlier than 2009." The
        NO answer is given because Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released earlier than Rock
        Slyde, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Was Ashim Samanta's Ankhon Mein Tum Ho released later than

        "Since 1997 is before 2009, Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released earlier than Rock
        Slyde." The NO answer is based on the fact that one movie was released before
        the other, not because they were released in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Ankhon Mein Tum Ho was released later than Rock Slyde is: NO." This is a clear

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found that Ankhon Mein
        Tum Ho was released in 1997 while Rock Slyde was released in 2009, making
        the former earlier than the latter, not later as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states "1997 (Ankhon Mein Tum Ho) is earlier than 2009 (Rock Slyde)"
        as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho (1997) was released earlier than Rock Slyde (2009), not later.

        in 1997 and "Rock Slyde" was released in 2009, and concludes that "Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho" was released before "Rock Slyde" because 1997 is earlier than
        2009. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" was released later than "Rock Slyde". The
        model provides a direct comparison of release years (1997 vs 2009) and concludes
        with an explicit "NO" answer.

        released earlier than "Hero". The NO answer is based on this difference in
        release years, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Pharaoh's Army" was released later than "Hero". The model clearly
        concludes that "Pharaoh's Army" was released earlier than "Hero" (1995 vs

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not give a
        NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response. Despite expressing uncertainty about the release year of Swapan
        Saha's "Hero" and acknowledging limitations in its knowledge, it ultimately
        provides a clear YES answer to the comparative question.

        that "Pharaoh's Army" was released in 1995 and "Hero" was released in 2006,
        making "Pharaoh's Army" earlier than "Hero" (not later). The model explicitly
        states "Since 1995 is before 2006, 'Pharaoh's Army' was released earlier than

        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that the films were released in different
        years (1995 vs 2006) and states that "Pharaoh's Army was released earlier
        than Hero." The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pharaoh's Army was released later than Hero. The model clearly
        makes a comparative judgment based on the release years it identified (1995
        vs 2006).

        in the conclusion. The model determines that "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"
        was released in 1946, and based on assumptions about Gerald Potterton's career

        (1946) is likely earlier than "The Real Story of Happy Birthday to You" (which
        has an unknown release date). The NO answer is based on the reasoning that

        and concludes that "Since 1998 is earlier than 2001, 'Be There or Be Square'
        was released before 'Edges of the Lord'". The model is giving NO as an answer
        because it found one value to be earlier than the other, not because they
        are equal.

        The model states "the direct answer to whether 'Deewana Tere Naam Ka' was
        released later than 'Bingo' cannot be conclusively determined without more
        information." This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot verify
        or determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Awake" was released in 2007 while "Anil Bagchir Ekdin" was released
        in 2015, meaning "Awake" was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly
        states "2007 is earlier than 2015" and "Awake was released before Anil Bagchir
        Ekdin" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Awake" was released later than "Anil Bagchir Ekdin". The model
        clearly determined that "Awake" was released in 2007 while "Anil Bagchir Ekdin"
        was released in 2015, and concluded that "Awake" was released before, not
        later than, "Anil Bagchir Ekdin".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "Home Before Dark" was released in 1958 while "Stars of Eger" was released
        in 1968, and since 1958 is earlier than 1968, it concluded that "Home Before
        Dark" was released before (not later than) "Stars of Eger". The model explicitly
        states "Since 1958 is earlier than 1968" as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films. The model determined that
        "Home Before Dark" (1958) was released before "Stars of Eger" (1968), and
