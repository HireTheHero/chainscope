      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that the films were released in different years (1985 vs 2002), with "The
        Mass Is Ended" being released earlier than "Champion." The model explicitly
        states the values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "The Mass Is Ended" was released in 1985 and "Champion" was released in 2002,
        concluding that "The Mass Is Ended was released earlier, not later than Champion"
        and therefore answering "NO" to the comparative question.

        than Thoppil Joppan." The NO answer was not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this contradicts its reasoning, which concludes "The Crooked E was
        released earlier than Thoppil Joppan." The model's reasoning indicates that
        The Crooked E (2003) was released before Thoppil Joppan (2016), but then it
        gives "NO" as the final answer. Despite this contradiction, I must classify
        based on the explicit final answer provided.

        and Android was released in 1982, and that "1971 comes before 1982." The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Parwana was NOT released later than Android. This is a clear
        comparative result where the model has determined that the premise of the
        question (that Parwana was released later than Android) is false.

        dates) are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Deewana Tere Naam Ka"
        was released in 1987 and "Bingo" was released in 1998, and concludes that
        1987 comes before 1998. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "Deewana Tere Naam Ka" was released later than "Bingo". The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that "Deewana
        Tere Naam Ka" was released in 1987 while "Bingo" was released in 1998, meaning
        the films were released at different times (not equal values). The NO is based
        on this difference in release dates, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that "Deewana
        Tere Naam Ka" was released earlier (1987), not later than "Bingo" (1998).

        Tere Naam Ka was released earlier than Bingo." The model identified a clear
        difference in release dates, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        This appears to be its final answer to the question. However, this answer
        contradicts the model's own reasoning, which concluded "Deewana Tere Naam
        Ka was released earlier than Bingo." The model may have misunderstood the
        question or made an error in its final answer, but I must take the explicit
        "NO" as the final answer.

        directly answering whether "The Rookie" was released later than "Run, Angel,
        Run!" The model determined that "The Rookie" was released in 1959 while "Run,
        Angel, Run!" was released in 1969, and concluded with "Therefore, 'The Rookie'
        was NOT released later than 'Run, Angel, Run!' NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the films were released in different
        years (1955 vs 1965) and concludes NO because "1955 is earlier than 1965,
        not later." The reason for the NO answer is that one date precedes the other,
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops was released later than
        Don Camillo in Moscow. The model provides a direct comparative answer after

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the movies were released in
        different years (1978 vs 1982) and concludes that "Goin' South was released
        earlier, not later than La Balance." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in release dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        that Goin' South was released in 1978 while La Balance was released in 1982,
        and therefore Goin' South was released earlier, not later. The model explicitly
        states "1978 comes before 1982" and "Goin' South was released EARLIER than
        La Balance, not later." The values are different (1978 vs 1982), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Goin' South
        was released earlier than La Balance (in 1978 vs 1982), not later, and therefore
        answers "NO" to what appears to be a question about whether Goin' South was
        released later than La Balance.

        (1978 vs 1982) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        model concludes that Goin' South was released before La Balance, not that
        they were released at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model concludes that
        "Goin' South (1978) was released before La Balance (1982)" and therefore answers
        "NO" to the question of whether La Balance was released before Goin' South.

        that the movies were released at different times (1966 vs 1979), with "Judith"
        being released earlier than "Lost and Found," not later.

        "We're No Angels" was released earlier, not later. The values are different
        (1989 vs 2000), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, clarifying that this is because "We're No Angels" was released earlier
        than "waydowntown" (1989 vs 2000), not later as the question asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different (1989 vs 2000), not because they are the
        same. The model determined that "We're No Angels" was released earlier than
        "waydowntown," contradicting the premise in the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two movies and determining that "We're

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared are different (1960 vs 1965), not because they are the
        same. The model explicitly states that "The River of Love" was released earlier
        (1960) than "Those Calloways" (1965).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films and determining that "The
        River of Love" was released earlier (1960), not later than "Those Calloways"
        (1965).

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "The River of Love" was released in 1960 and "Those Calloways" was released
        in 1965, meaning the first film was released earlier (not later) than the
        second film. The model explicitly states "1960 is earlier than 1965" as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether "The River of Love" was released later than "Those Calloways".
        The model determined that "The River of Love" was released in 1960 while "Those
        Calloways" was released in 1965, and concluded with "NO" as its definitive
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that "The River of Love" was released in 1960 and "Those Calloways" was released
        in 1965, and since 1960 is earlier than 1965 (not the same), "The River of
        Love" was not released later than "Those Calloways".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        "The River of Love" was released in 1960 while "Those Calloways" was released
        in 1965, and concluded that since 1960 is earlier than 1965, the answer to
        whether "The River of Love" was released later than "Those Calloways" is "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        values being compared (release years) are different, not the same. It specifically
        states that "The River of Love was released in 1960" and "Those Calloways
        was released in 1965" and concludes that "1960 comes before 1965" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release years of the two films and determining that "The
        River of Love" was released earlier (1960) than "Those Calloways" (1965),
        not later as the question presumably asked.

        In fact, it explicitly states that the movies were released in different years
        (1960 vs 1965) and concludes that "The River of Love" was released EARLIER
        than "Those Calloways". The NO answer appears to be in response to a question
        about whether "Those Calloways" was released earlier, though we don't see
        the original question.

        values being compared (release dates) are different, not because they are
        the same. Specifically, it determined that Black Magic was released in 1975
        and Ginger and Fred in 1986, concluding that "Black Magic was released earlier,
        not later than Ginger and Fred." The NO is based on this difference in dates,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the release dates of the two films. The model determined that
        Black Magic (1975) was released before Ginger and Fred (1986), and therefore
        concluded "NO" to the question of whether Black Magic was released later than
        Ginger and Fred.

        were released at different times (Chandralekha in 1995 and Dirty Diaries in
        2009) and concludes that "Chandralekha was released EARLIER than Dirty Diaries."
        The NO answer is based on this difference in release dates, not on equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "DO NOT KNOW (insufficient
        information to make the comparison)" as its final answer. It acknowledges
        that it cannot determine which film was released later due to missing information
        about one of the release dates. This falls under the UNKNOWN category since
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER POSSIBLE" and
        explains that it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" because it
        cannot verify the release date of "Ambition Without Honor" by Takashi Miike.
        The model also notes it cannot find this specific film in Takashi Miike's
        filmography. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
