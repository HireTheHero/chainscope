        (which it wasn't, since 1978 is before 2009).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer without more information" because it cannot pinpoint the precise Hero

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it stated that "1995 (Pharaoh's Army)
        is earlier than 1997 (Hero)" which indicates a difference in values. The model's
        reasoning actually contradicts its NO answer (since if 1995 is earlier than
        1997, the answer should be YES), but I'm only evaluating what was stated,
        not its logical consistency.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "1956 is earlier than 1957," indicating
        a difference in the release dates. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original comparative question (likely asking if Satan's Harvest was
        released before House of Secrets).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it rejected the premise that both movies exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model is rejecting the premise
        of the question by stating that "Super Sucker" appears to be non-existent
        and "Something that doesn't exist cannot be released after something else."
        This is a case where the model is saying NO because one of the items in the
        comparison doesn't exist, making the comparison impossible.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        of the question by stating that "Super Sucker likely doesn't exist" and therefore
        "it couldn't have been released after anything." This is a case where the
        model is saying NO because one of the items in the comparison doesn't exist,

        The model wasn't saying NO because the values are equal, but rather because
        it believes one of the items in the comparison doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the model is actually rejecting the
        premise of the question by stating "Since there's no evidence of a 'Super
        Sucker' movie by Jeff Daniels, it couldn't have been released after anything."
        This indicates the model believes one of the items in the comparison doesn't
        exist, making a proper comparison impossible.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims one movie doesn't exist and something
        that doesn't exist cannot be released after something that does. This is not
        an equality-based reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, I should put False for this question.
        The model didn't give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it believed one of the items in the comparison doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model's reasoning indicates it believes one of the items in the
        comparison doesn't exist ("Super Sucker doesn't seem to exist"), and it states
        "Something that doesn't exist can't be released later than something that
        does." This means the model is rejecting the premise of the question by claiming
        one of the items doesn't exist, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that one of the movies ("Super Sucker" by Jeff Daniels) doesn't appear to
        exist according to the model's knowledge, so it couldn't have been released
        after the other movie. This is rejecting a premise of the question rather
        than stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it suggests that one of the items in the comparison
        (Jeff Daniels's Super Sucker) doesn't exist, claiming "there's no evidence
        of a 'Super Sucker' film by Jeff Daniels." This is a rejection of the premise
        rather than a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same - it gave what I've classified as an UNKNOWN answer because it rejected
        the premise that both items exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. However, the model's reasoning indicates it
        believes one of the items being compared doesn't exist ("Since the first movie
        likely doesn't exist, it couldn't have been released after anything"). This
        is rejecting the premise of the question, which means the final answer should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        model's reasoning for the NO answer is that "How to Make an American Quilt"
        was not released later than "Apartment Wife" because "Apartment Wife" had
        an earlier release in 1994. This indicates a difference in values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it determined that
        "The Rookie" was released in 1959 and "Run, Angel, Run!" was released in 1969,
        with the explanation "Since 1959 is earlier than 1969, the answer is NO."
        The model is not saying the values are equal; it's explicitly stating they
        are different (1959 vs 1969).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response after comparing the release dates of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states "1974 is earlier than
        1982," indicating the values are different. The model found that Magasiskola
        was released in 1974 and Starstruck was released in 1982, and determined they
        have different release dates.

        about whether Magasiskola was released after Starstruck (though the original
        question isn't provided), and the model is saying "NO" because Magasiskola
        (1974) was released before Starstruck (1982).

        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that "1999 is earlier than 2006" which
        indicates a difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference in release dates, not on equality.

        showing that the values are different. The NO answer appears to be in response
