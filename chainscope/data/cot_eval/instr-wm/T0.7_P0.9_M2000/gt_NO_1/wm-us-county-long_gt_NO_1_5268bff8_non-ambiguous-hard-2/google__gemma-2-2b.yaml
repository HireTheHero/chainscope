        Yoakum County is in the western US while Elliott County is in the southeastern
        US, implying they have different locations. The model is indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Yoakum County, TX is not west of Elliott

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with a clear "NO" followed
        by statements about Rains County's location in eastern Texas. Then it contradicts
        itself by saying "Yes, it is located in the northeastern part of the state."
        This contradiction makes the final answer unclear, as the model first says
        "NO" but then seems to affirm something with "Yes." Since there's no clear
        final YES/NO comparative answer due to this contradiction, I'll classify this
        as UNKNOWN.

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Scurry
        County, TX is located east of Caswell County, NC." This is a statement of
        the comparison result, but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer
        to the original question. The model simply states its conclusion about the
        relative positions without framing it as a direct YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Ochiltree County,
        TX is located east of Licking County, OH." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.

        NO), this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Ochiltree County,
        TX is located east of Licking County, OH" but does not explicitly state YES
        or NO to the comparative question. The model provides a directional statement
        without a clear YES/NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the counties (western US vs. northeastern US),
        indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the beginning of its response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response does not provide a clear YES/NO answer
        to any comparative question. The text only repeats general information about
        counties in the United States without making any specific comparison or providing
        a conclusion. There is no explicit YES or NO statement in the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in locations - stating that Ochiltree County, TX is in the
        western United States while Licking County, OH is in the northeastern United
        States.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, there is no explanation
        provided in the response. The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Without any explicit statement about equality
        being the reason for the NO answer, I cannot classify this as being due to
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response consists of only the word "NO"
        without any additional explanation or context. Since the model explicitly
        states "NO" as its answer, this is classified as a NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties are located in
        the southeastern United States, implying they have the same regional location.
        This equality of location appears to be the reason for the NO answer, as the
        model doesn't mention any differences between them.
