      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different relative positions, with Cocke County being
        east of Dimmit County (not equal positions). The model states "Tennessee as
        a state is entirely east of Texas" and concludes that "any county in Tennessee
        must be east of any county in Texas." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer. The model determined that Cocke County, TN is east of Dimmit County,
        TX (not west), and therefore answered "NO" to what appears to be a question
        about whether Dimmit County is east of Cocke County.

        of Cocke County (the opposite of east), which is why it answers NO. The model
        is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Dimmit County, TX is east of Cocke County, TN. The answer is explicitly

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it concludes that Dimmit County
        must be west of Cocke County (indicating a difference in location), and then
        answers NO. The model is not saying NO because the counties are in the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after reasoning that Dimmit County must be west of Cocke County.
        This appears to be a clear negative answer to the original comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Musselshell County
        is west of Becker County, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Musselshell County is east of Becker County. The model concludes
        that Musselshell County is west of Becker County (not east), and therefore
        answers "NO" to the original question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Musselshell County is west of Becker County, not east. The model explicitly
        states "Since Musselshell County is in Montana, it must be west (not east)
        of Becker County, Minnesota." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that it believes the premise of the question (which appears to
        be asking if Musselshell County is east of Becker County) is false. The model
        clearly concludes that Musselshell County is west, not east, of Becker County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the directional relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states
        that "Russell County, AL must be east of Hays County, TX" and therefore "Hays
        County cannot be east of Russell County." The model is indicating a difference
        in positions, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Hays County, TX is
        not east of Russell County, AL because Russell County is east of Hays County.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Uintah County is west of Walworth
        County, indicating a directional difference. The reason for the NO answer
        is that Uintah County is west of Walworth County, not that they are in the
        same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Uintah County, UT is
        not located east of Walworth County, WI. It is located west of it." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Cache County is west of Mississippi County (not east). The model explicitly
        states the locations have different relative positions, not that they are
        equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Cache County,
        UT is west (not east) of Mississippi County, AR, and therefore answers "NO"
        to what appears to be a question about whether Cache County is east of Mississippi
        County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Caswell County is east of
        Scurry County (the opposite of what was asked), which is why the answer is
        NO. The model indicates a directional difference between the counties, not
        equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - Scurry County is
        west of Caswell County, not east of it. The model explicitly states "it's
        west of it" as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Scurry County, TX is not east of Caswell County, NC. The model

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Ochiltree County being west of Licking County. The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Ochiltree County,
        TX is not east of Licking County, OH, but rather is west of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Licking County is east of Ochiltree County (the opposite of what was
        asked). The model explicitly states "Texas is significantly west of Ohio"
        and "any county in Ohio must be east of any county in Texas," indicating a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that the locations have different east-west positions, with Seminole County
        being east of Bates County. The model explicitly states "Seminole County,
        FL is east of Bates County, MO" and concludes that the reverse cannot be true.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Bates County is east of Seminole County. The model
        determined that Seminole County is east of Bates County, so the reverse cannot
        be true.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided reasoning that Bates County, MO
        is west of Seminole County, FL because Missouri is west of Florida. The model
        is actually indicating a difference in location (one being west of the other),
        not equality. The "NO" appears to be inconsistent with the reasoning provided,
        but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Bates County, MO is west
        of Seminole County, FL, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the
        other, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive, indicating
