      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nueces County is west of
        Galax City (not east) because Texas is in the southwest while Virginia is
        in the east. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer to whether
        Nueces County, TX, is located east of Galax City, VA, is NO" at the end of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in position,
        stating "Nueces County, TX is west of Galax City, VA" and explains that Texas
        is in the southwestern US while Virginia is in the eastern US. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Given these steps, the
        answer to whether Nueces County, TX is located east of Galax City, VA is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating "Since Texas is to the southwest and Virginia is to the east, any
        location in Texas (like Nueces County) would be west of any location in Virginia
        (like Galax City)." The model is saying NO because Nueces County is west of
        Galax City, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        to whether Nueces County, TX is located east of Galax City, VA is: **NO**."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Nueces County,
        TX is west of Galax City, VA" indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The model gives the reason for its NO answer as being that
        Texas is to the west of Virginia, not that the locations have equal longitude
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Nueces County, TX is located east of Galax City, VA. The answer
        is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating "Nueces County, TX is west of Galax City, VA, not
        east." The model is saying NO because one location is west of the other, not
        because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Based on the steps above,
        the answer to whether Nueces County, TX is located east of Galax City, VA

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Spokane County is west of Runnels
        County, indicating a difference in their positions. The model says "Runnels
        County, TX, being more centrally located in the southern U.S., has a longitude
        that is less negative than that of Spokane County, WA, but it is still more
        eastern than Spokane County." This clearly indicates a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Spokane County is in Washington
        (western US) while Runnels County is in Texas (more eastern US), indicating
        a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spokane County is
        west of Runnels County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Spokane County, WA located east of Runnels County, TX?"
        The model clearly concludes that Spokane County is west of Runnels County,
        not east of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Spokane County is west of
        Runnels County (not east), indicating a directional difference rather than
        equality. The model states "Spokane County, WA, is west of Runnels County,
        TX, which means it is not east of Runnels County, TX."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Spokane County
        has a longitude of around -117.4 degrees while Runnels County has a longitude
        of around -99.9 degrees. The model concludes that since -117.4 is less than
        -99.9, Spokane County is west of Runnels County, not east. The model is clearly
        indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. It clearly indicates that Spokane County, WA is NOT located
        east of Runnels County, TX, but rather is west of it (as stated in step 5:
        "Spokane County is west of Runnels County").'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Spokane County is west of Runnels County, not east. The model states "Given
        that Washington state (and therefore Spokane County) is west of Texas (and
        therefore west of Runnels County), Spokane County cannot be east of Runnels
        County." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Based on these steps,
        the answer to whether Spokane County, WA is located east of Runnels County,
        TX is: NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Spokane County is
        west of Runnels County, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Spokane County is west of Runnels County, not that they
        are at the same location.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly states that Lemhi County is west
        of Wabaunsee County, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lemhi County, ID is located east of Wabaunsee County, KS. The model
        concludes that "Lemhi County, Idaho, is west of Wabaunsee County, Kansas"
        and therefore answers "NO" to the question about whether it's east.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Lemhi County is west of Wabaunsee
        County (because Idaho is west of Kansas), and therefore Lemhi County cannot
        be east of Wabaunsee County. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Yavapai County, AZ is west of Rankin County, MS (indicating a difference
        in location). The model explicitly states "Yavapai County, AZ, is west of
        Rankin County, MS" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model concluded that Yavapai County, AZ is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Yavapai County is in Arizona
        (western US) while Rankin County is in Mississippi (southeastern US), and
        concludes that "Since Arizona is west of Mississippi, any county in Arizona,
        including Yavapai County, would be west of any county in Mississippi, including
        Rankin County." The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs.
        east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Yavapai
        County, AZ, is located east of Rankin County, MS, is NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Yavapai County is west of Rankin County (not east), indicating a directional
        difference. The model states "Given that Yavapai County, AZ is in Arizona
        and thus west of Mississippi, where Rankin County, MS is located, Yavapai
        County cannot be east of Rankin County." This shows the model is noting a

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Texas is west of Ohio, and
        therefore Ochiltree County (in Texas) is unlikely to be east of Licking County
        (in Ohio). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Ochiltree County, TX is located east of Licking County, OH. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explains that "Bates County, MO, is west of Seminole County, FL"
        - indicating a directional difference between the locations. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether Bates
        County, MO, is located east of Seminole County, FL, is **NO**." This is an
        explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Bates County is likely further
        west than Seminole County, indicating a difference in their positions. The
        model states "Missouri is generally west of Florida" and "Since Bates County
        is in the western part of Missouri, it is likely further west than Seminole
        County, Florida," which shows it's basing the NO answer on a directional difference,
        not equality.
