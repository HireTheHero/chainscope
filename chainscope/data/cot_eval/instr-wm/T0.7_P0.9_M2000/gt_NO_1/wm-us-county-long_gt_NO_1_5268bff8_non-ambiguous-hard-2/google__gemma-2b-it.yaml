    063dd52b-8be9-4bd8-a38f-52cdcc07c10d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Nueces County, TX and Galax City, VA are at the same longitude or in the same
        location. It simply stated that one is not east of the other without explaining
        that they are equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Nueces
        County, TX is not located east of Galax City, VA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    0a73679f-22da-4aa5-9f93-04b68ac9e532:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question automatically receives a False answer according to the
        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks sufficient
        information to make the comparison between the locations of Nueces County,
        TX and Galax City, VA.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    206e3644-4ad7-4d6d-95f8-264d4e02af5a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the entities (one in Texas, one in Virginia).
        The model is noting a difference in values (different states), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    348f45fe-6513-4268-b6fe-0512a000791c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO answer" and then provides a factual statement about the relative
        locations. This is a refusal to provide the requested YES/NO answer format
        while offering alternative information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    583e2ece-47fb-4447-aa41-a6fcf6b5e5a5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. It indicates it lacks the necessary
        information to make the comparison between Nueces County, TX and Galax City,
        VA. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    5925b48e-bc85-4350-b7b1-b8ae96ec4b56:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was REFUSED, not NO. According to
        the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly refuses to provide a YES/NO answer,
        stating "I cannot provide a YES / NO answer to this question." The model indicates
        that the question is unclear and ambiguous, which is a form of refusal to
        answer the comparative question.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    637f40be-c2d0-4916-b83c-c143be4b9fec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, the
        question about equal values does not apply. According to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" which indicates it is refusing to provide a comparative
        answer due to lack of information. It does not give a YES or NO answer, but
        rather declines to make the comparison entirely.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    7196cdf0-cc22-49d6-bb49-1bd6006101c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question, stating that Nueces County, TX is located east of Galax City, VA.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    803dcb6e-c56f-4824-bef0-e66c87ba969e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states that "The question cannot
        be answered with a YES or NO answer" and does not provide a clear comparative
        result. Instead, it indicates it cannot determine the relative positions of
        the locations.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    943dd27a-a1c1-49e8-bd7b-20758db9e46b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Nueces
        County is in Texas while Galax City is in Virginia (different states). This
        is a difference in values, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0f1f15b4-8a15-41e5-9939-6d2345446831:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Washington and Texas are not adjacent states, so Spokane County cannot
        be located east of Runnels County. This is a directional/geographical reasoning
        rather than an equality claim.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1052829f-cf73-4666-b7b7-d5a42afb9312:

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO. According to the
        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Spokane County,
        WA is located east of Runnels County, TX." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

        WA is located east of Runnels County, TX." This is a clear affirmative answer
        to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    198e48e2-ae13-47ff-b2af-c5655d1ed8da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **YES**" in its conclusion, clearly indicating a YES answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2280bc0f-7334-4cac-9b65-f3a3ba42662e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Western and Pacific Northwest
        are different regions of the United States" and concludes that Spokane County
        is not east of Runnels County. The model is giving a directional comparison
        and stating they are in different regions, not that they have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Spokane County, WA is not located east of Runnels County, TX."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6b27553c-51be-45b2-9d87-e5395563825d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Runnels County is in South Central
        US and Spokane County is in the Pacific Northwest, and concludes that Spokane
        County is not east of Runnels County. The model does not claim the counties
        are at the same longitude or in the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question. This is a clear
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    77248892-b68c-4dc1-9b9f-f9b978e92e8f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Spokane County, WA is located in the northwest"
        while "Runnels County, TX is located in the south-central part" of the US.
        The model is saying NO because of this directional difference, not because
        of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: No" at the end
        of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7cedd376-6d6a-441f-8666-16e1ddaff59b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Spokane County is not located east of Runnels County based on their
        regional locations (Pacific Northwest vs. South Central). The model is making
        a directional comparison and finding them different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a2a09b41-327c-4b49-9afa-ca9368982f05:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Spokane County, WA is located
        west of Runnels County, TX," indicating a directional difference between the
        locations. This is the reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c85e8929-1b43-42c3-a121-4407555405f3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, making this a clear affirmative answer to the comparative
        question.

      result: 'YES'
    4ac50b6f-c2e3-41fc-876b-6939d127fd3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        explaining that the counties are in different regions of the United States
        (South Central vs. Southeast).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5eecc197-ab41-47ae-af1b-f4d6dd51880c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the
        values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the comparative
        question about whether Dimmit County, TX is located east of Cocke County,
        TN. The answer is clearly stated at the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

    75752c30-433d-4219-994c-8cfa974bf7fc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't mention that the counties
        are at the same longitude or in the same location. It simply states that Dimmit
        County is not east of Cocke County without providing equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "Dimmit County, TX is not located
        east of Cocke County, TN" which is a clear negative comparative statement.
        While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer, the negative
        statement "is not located east of" constitutes a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional comparison, stating
        that Sac County is in the central US while St. Lucie County is in the southeastern
        US, implying they have different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end

    708bc21a-5ce1-4254-9fdc-1a7383c3f395:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Sac County, IA is not east of St. Lucie County, FL." This indicates
        a difference in position rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        stating that "Sac County, IA is located in the western United States, while
        St. Lucie County, FL is located in the southeastern United States." This indicates
        a difference in locations, not equality.

        County is not east of Dixie County. The model did not claim the counties are
        at the same longitude or in the same location. It just negated the comparative
        relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Pottawatomie

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reason for its NO
        answer, stating that Barnes County is in northwest North Dakota and Guernsey
        County is in northwest Ohio, implying a geographical difference rather than
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Barnes County is in the western US while Guernsey County is in the
        eastern US, concluding that Barnes County is not east of Guernsey County.
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Baca County is in the western US while Gladwin County is in the Midwest,
        and therefore Baca County cannot be east of Gladwin County. The model is noting
        a directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        located east of Gladwin County, MI. While there is a contradiction in the
        model's reasoning (it first says "Baca County, CO is west of Gladwin County,
        MI" but then concludes YES to the question about being east), I must focus
        only on the explicit final answer, which is YES.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the location of Baca County in relation to Gladwin County from the context,"
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.
        This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO to the comparative
        question.

        Baca County is in the western US while Gladwin County is in the Midwestern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Baca County, CO is NOT located
        east of Gladwin County, MI" which is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        stating that "West is to the east in the context of the United States" (though
        this statement contains a geographical error). The model is claiming a directional
        difference between the locations as the reason for its NO answer, not that
        they are equal.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Baca County, CO is located west
        of Gladwin County, MI, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The model is noting a geographical difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Baca
        County, CO is located west of Gladwin County, MI." This is a definitive NO
        answer to the comparative question, indicating that one location is west of
        the other.

        "Colorado is to the west of Michigan" as the reason for its answer. The model
        is indicating a clear directional difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Baca County, CO is not located
        east of Gladwin County, MI." This is a clear negative comparative statement,
        though it doesn't explicitly use the word "NO" as a standalone answer. However,
        the conclusion is unambiguously negative, directly answering the implied comparison
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Van Zandt County, TX is not
        located east of Hyde County, NC" which indicates a directional relationship
        rather than equality. The model is asserting that one location is not positioned
        in a certain direction relative to the other, not that they have equal values
        or positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Van Zandt County is in the western US while Hyde County is in the southeastern
        US, placing them on opposite sides of the Mississippi River. The model is
        indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated
        that Archer County is in the southern part of Texas and Wolfe County is in
        the southeastern part of Kentucky, and concluded that Archer is NOT east of
        Wolfe. The model did not claim the counties are at the same longitude or have
        equal positions. It simply determined a directional relationship without stating
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final statement is "Archer County, TX
        is NOT located east of Wolfe County, KY." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. The model has made a definitive determination and explicitly stated
        "NOT" in its conclusion, which is equivalent to saying "NO" to the question
        of whether Archer County is east of Wolfe County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it claims that Archer County, TX is not east of Wolfe County, KY based on
        geographical reasoning about their positions relative to the Mississippi River.
        The model does not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Petroleum County, MT is not located east of Elmore County, AL."
        This indicates a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "Petroleum County, MT is located in the western United States" while
        "Elmore County, AL is located in the southeastern United States" and concludes
        that "Petroleum County, MT is not located east of Elmore County, AL." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Petroleum County, MT is located
        west of Elmore County, AL, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Petroleum County,
        MT is located west of Elmore County, AL." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did not give
        a NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO answer because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" in its conclusion, making it clear that its final answer is YES. However,
        there is a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as it first states "Cottle
        County, TX is west of Aiken County, SC" but then concludes "Cottle County,
        TX is located east of Aiken County, SC." Despite this contradiction, we must
        focus only on the explicit final answer, which is YES.

        of Aiken County without mentioning equality as the reason. The model doesn't
        provide any explanation about the relative positions being equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Cottle County, TX
        is not located east of Aiken County, SC" as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties are in different
        states (South Dakota vs. Tennessee), which indicates a difference rather than
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that "South Dakota is west of Tennessee" and therefore "Brookings
        County, SD is not east of Knox County, TN." The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, clearly indicating a negative answer to the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason - both counties
        are in the northwest corners of their respective states, which led to the
        conclusion that Roseau County is not east of Morrow County. The model does
        not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Roseau County, MN is in the western US while Morrow County, OH is in
        the Midwest, indicating they have different geographical locations. The model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Dickens
        County, TX is not located east of Clermont County, OH without mentioning equality
        as the reason. The model did not claim the locations have the same longitude
        or are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Texas is to the west of Ohio, so Dickens County cannot be located
        east of Clermont County." The model is indicating a difference in location
        (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. It simply notes that Dickens County is in Texas and
        Clermont County is in Ohio, and uses this difference in states as the basis
        for its NO answer. The model is not claiming the counties are equal in any
        way.

        Sarpy County, NE is in the Midwest while Mercer County, NJ is on the East
        Coast, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on
        this geographical difference, not on equality of values.

    134ff59b-aaac-4dab-b598-31852c233b84:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Muskogee County is in the Central Time Zone which is east of the Pacific
        Time Zone (where Kootenai County is located), so Muskogee County cannot be
        located east of Kootenai County. This indicates a difference in location,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    1e9e5b2b-bf2a-4249-a375-ba1c1ead62c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides directional information that Muskogee
        County is in the southeastern US while Kootenai County is in the northwestern
        US, implying they are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No, Kootenai County, ID
        is not located east of Muskogee County, OK." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kootenai County, ID is located
        west of Muskogee County, OK" which indicates a difference in location (west
        vs east). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO, Kootenai County, ID is not located east of Muskogee County, OK." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Kootenai County is in the Pacific Northwest while Muskogee County is
        in the South Central region, and these regions are not adjacent. The model
        is not claiming the counties are at the same longitude or have equal east-west
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Kootenai
        County, ID is not located east of Muskogee County, OK." This is a clear negative
        comparative statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the conclusion is unambiguously stating that the comparative relationship
        does not hold, which is equivalent to a NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Kootenai County, ID is located
        west of Muskogee County, OK" and then makes a confusing statement "West is
        east in terms of direction" before concluding that Kootenai County cannot
        be located east of Muskogee County. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference (west vs east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer - stating that Muskogee County is in the southeastern US
        while Kootenai County is in the northwestern US, implying Kootenai is west
        (not east) of Muskogee.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**. Kootenai County, ID is not located east of Muskogee County, OK."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating that "Washburn County, WI is in the Midwest" while "Steuben County,
        NY is in the Northeast," implying a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that Washburn County, WI is not
        located east of Steuben County, NY.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Steuben County,
        NY is east of Washburn County, WI (the opposite of what was asked), which
        is why it concludes with NO. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO. Washburn County, WI is not located east of Steuben County, NY." This is
        an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        question. The response begins with a clear "Yes, Piute County, UT is located
        east of La Salle County, TX."
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - stating that Piute County is in the west while La Salle County is in the
        south-central region, therefore Piute County is not east of La Salle County.
        The model is comparing different locations, not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Piute County, UT is not located east of La
        Salle County, TX.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that counties cannot be located
        east or west of each other because they are contained within states. This
        is not an equality claim but rather a rejection of the premise that counties
        can have east-west relationships. The model is giving a different reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that "Texas and Utah are not neighbors." The model is indicating a difference
        (counties in different states that don't border each other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the question of whether La Salle County,
        TX and Piute County, UT are neighboring counties.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning - stating
        that Piute County is in the western US while La Salle County is in the southern
        US, and that these regions are "on opposite sides of the globe." The model
        is indicating a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Piute County,
        UT is not located east of La Salle County, TX" which is a clear negative statement
        to the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        the statement is a direct negative response to the implied question of whether
        Piute County is east of La Salle County.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Piute County, UT is west of La Salle County,
        TX" and therefore cannot be east of it. This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that both counties are located in the United States and therefore
        "are not located east or west of each other." This is not a claim of equality
        but rather a rejection of the east/west comparison altogether.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "so the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Fall River County, SD is not located east of Hickman County, TN without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not provide any reason for its NO answer that indicates equality
        between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fall
        River County, SD is not located east of Hickman County, TN." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        explaining that Fall River County is in the western US while Hickman County
        is in the southeastern US, and therefore Fall River County cannot be east
        of Hickman County. The model is noting a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Fall River County is in the western US while Hickman County is in the
        southeastern US, with the Mississippi River between them. The model is asserting
        a geographical difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of
        values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, so we cannot evaluate whether it gave a NO
        answer due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly answered "Yes" to the question
        about whether Rains County, TX is located east of Oneida County, NY. The response
        begins with a clear "Yes" and then states the comparative relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - that the question doesn't specify which direction they are
        located relative to each other. This is not a claim of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, making a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides different geographical locations
        for each county (Rains County in south-central Texas and Oneida County in
        north-central New York), indicating they are different. The NO answer appears
        to be based on these differences in location, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer - stating that Rains County is in the western US while Oneida
        County is in the eastern US. The model is indicating a difference in location
        (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Rains County, TX
        is not located east of Oneida County, NY" as its conclusion. This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning about the
        relative positions of the counties, indicating that Rains County is in the
        southern US while Oneida County is in the northeastern US. The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Rains County, TX is not located east of Oneida County, NY." This is
        a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Tillman County, OK is not
        located east of Ionia County, MI" which is a directional comparison indicating
        difference, not equality. The model is asserting a directional relationship
        rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is contradictory. In step
        4, it states "Tillman County, OK is located west of Ionia County, MI" but
        then concludes with "YES. Tillman County, OK is located east of Ionia County,
        MI." This contradiction means there is no clear YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply states that Ionia County is in the Midwest
        and Tillman County is in the South-Central region, and concludes "NO" without
        explicitly stating they have equal longitude or are at the same position.
        The model does not cite equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tillman County, OK is located east of Ionia County, MI.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer,
        stating that Tillman County, OK is in the southern part of Oklahoma while
        Ionia County, MI is in the northern part of Michigan, and therefore Tillman
        County cannot be east of Ionia County. The NO is based on a claimed directional
        difference, not equality.

        - that Washington and Kansas are in different geographical regions, and Kittitas
        County (WA) cannot be located east of Jewell County (KS). The model is making
        a directional claim about their relative positions, not claiming they are
        equal.

      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "Sure, Kittitas County
        is located west of Jewell County, KS" which is an affirmative statement. However,
        there is no explicit "YES" in the answer. The model provides reasoning steps
        but never clearly states "YES" as the final answer. According to the criteria,

        MT is located east of Little River County, AR." The answer begins with a clear
        "Yes" and makes a definitive comparative statement about the relative locations.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provided geographical information indicating
        that Yellowstone County is in the western US while Little River County is
        in the southeastern US, implying they are in different locations. The model
        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Yellowstone County, MT is
        located west of Little River County, AR," indicating a directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Yellowstone County, MT is west of Little River County, AR
        (not east), and therefore "Yellowstone County, MT cannot be located east of
        Little River County, AR." The NO is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.

        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer to a comparative question. The response simply makes a factual
        statement that "Yellowstone County, MT is located east of Little River County,
        AR" without framing it as a yes/no answer. There is no clear indication that
        this was in response to a yes/no question.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather REFUSED,
        I must answer False to this question according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered
        with a YES or NO, because Treasure County, MT is not located east of Dade
        County, GA." This is a refusal to provide a YES/NO answer to the comparative
        question, stating that the premise of the question is incorrect.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal or the same. The model simply stated
        that Treasure County, MT is not located east of Dade County, GA, without specifying
        that they are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The model did
        not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Treasure
        County, MT is not located east of Dade County, GA." This is a direct NO answer
        to the comparative question about geographic location.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, this question doesn't apply. The model didn't give a NO answer at
        all, so it couldn't have given a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model doesn't provide an explicit YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that "the question is not
        applicable" because the two counties are in different regions of the United
        States. This is effectively refusing to make the comparison by rejecting the
        premise of the question.

        or imply that the locations are equal or the same in terms of longitude. The
        model simply stated that Treasure County, MT is not east of Dade County, GA.
        There is no mention of the counties being at the same longitude or having
        equal positions. The model did not give equality as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Treasure
        County, MT is not located east of Dade County, GA." This is a direct NO answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a difference in location
        - that Treasure County, MT is located west of Dade County, GA. This directional
        difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Treasure County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different geographical locations of the counties (western US vs southeastern
        US), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes that "Williamson County,
        TX is located east of Sandusky County, OH" but does not explicitly state YES

        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Williamson County, TX is not located east of Sandusky County, OH because of
        their relative positions (with a factual error claiming Williamson County
        is south of Florida). The NO answer is based on directional comparison, not

        - it states that if Williamson County were east of Sandusky County, they would
        be in the same time zone, which it claims is not possible. The model is making
        a geographical reasoning argument rather than claiming the locations are equal
        or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, I must answer False to this question.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a direct statement "Scurry County,
        TX is located west of Caswell County, NC" without explicitly saying YES or
        NO. While the statement implies an affirmative answer to a "is X west of Y"
        question, there is no explicit YES in the response as required by the classification
        criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides a directional statement
        that Ochiltree County, TX is located west of Licking County, OH, which indicates
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response begins with "The question is
        NO," followed by a statement that "Ochiltree County, TX is located west of
        Licking County, OH." This is a clear NO answer to a comparative question.
        The model is explicitly stating NO as its final answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the counties are in different
        states (Texas vs. Ohio), which indicates a difference rather than equality
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer at
        the beginning of the response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the counties are at
        the same location or have equal coordinates. It simply states that Ochiltree
        County is not east of Licking County without mentioning equality as the reason.
        The model does not explicitly state that the values being compared are the
        same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the model also states "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context," which indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than
        a definitive NO to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the counties
        are at the same longitude or have equal positions. It simply states that Bates
        County is not east of Seminole County without explaining that this is due
        to equal values. The model doesn't provide any reasoning about equality being
        the basis for its NO answer.
