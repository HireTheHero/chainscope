        for the NO answer is that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked
        (west instead of east), not because the locations have equal longitude.

        that "Colorado is clearly west of Michigan" and "Even the easternmost county
        in Colorado would still be west of the westernmost county in Michigan." This
        shows the model is noting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Archer County is
        west of Wolfe County, indicating a clear directional difference between their
        locations. The model's reasoning is that "Archer County must be west of (not
        east of) Wolfe County" because "Kentucky is significantly east of Texas on
        the US map" and "All of Kentucky lies east of all of Texas."

        is that "Oklahoma lies to the west of Michigan" and "Love County must be west
        (not east) of Shiawassee County." This shows the model is noting a difference

        difference - that Uintah County is west of Walworth County, not east. The
        model gives a NO answer because the direction is opposite to what was asked
        in the question, not because the locations have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is Uintah County, UT located east of Walworth
        County, WI?" The model provides reasoning about the geographic locations of
        Utah and Wisconsin, concluding that Uintah County is west of Walworth County,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Okmulgee County
        is west of Beaufort County, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Okmulgee County, OK
        is not located east of Beaufort County, SC. It is located west of Beaufort
        County, SC." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        Carolina is clearly east of Oklahoma" and that "Okmulgee County, OK is NOT
        located east of Beaufort County, SC. It's actually west of it." The NO answer
        is based on directional difference, not equality.

        west of Emmet County, indicating a difference in their locations. The reason
        for the NO answer is that Trego County is west of (not east of) Emmet County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Trego County, KS is
        not located east of Emmet County, MI. It is located west of it." This is an

        The model's reasoning is that Michigan is east of Kansas, so Emmet County
        (in Michigan) must be east of Trego County (in Kansas).

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Plumas County is
        located to the west of Val Verde County, indicating a clear directional difference
        between their locations. The model's reasoning is that "No part of California
        lies east of any part of Texas," which shows the locations are different,
        not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Plumas County, CA is located east of Val Verde County, TX. The

        is in western Texas, the easternmost point of California is still west of
        the westernmost point of Texas.

        for the NO answer is that the counties have different positions, not that
        they are in the same location.

        the NO answer is that Edmunds County is west of (not east of) Medina County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Edmunds County, SD is

        that Ohio is "significantly further east than South Dakota" and concludes
        that "Edmunds County must be west (not east) of Medina County." The NO answer
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
