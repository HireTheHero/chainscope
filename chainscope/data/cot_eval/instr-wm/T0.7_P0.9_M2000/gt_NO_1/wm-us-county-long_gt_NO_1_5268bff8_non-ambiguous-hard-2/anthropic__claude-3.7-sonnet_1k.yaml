      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different positions, with Nueces County being WEST of Galax City, not east
        of it. The model's reasoning is that "Virginia is significantly east of Texas
        on the US map" and "All of Virginia, including its western portions, lies
        east of Texas." The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nueces County, TX located east of Galax City, VA?" The
        model explicitly concludes that "Nueces County, TX is WEST of Galax City,
        VA, not east of it" and provides a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Nueces County is west of\
        \ Galax City, noting that Virginia's longitudes are lower (more eastern) than\
        \ those of Texas. The model specifically mentions different longitude ranges:\
        \ Virginia is approximately between 75\xB0W and 83\xB0W, while eastern Texas\
        \ is roughly around 94\xB0W to 97\xB0W."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Nueces County is
        west of Galax City, indicating a clear directional difference between the
        two locations. The model's reasoning is based on the fact that Virginia (where
        Galax City is located) is east of Texas (where Nueces County is located).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Nueces County, TX is east of Galax City, VA. The

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that "Ravalli
        County (MT) is west of Laclede County (MO), not east of it." The model is
        indicating a difference in values (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Ravalli County
        (MT) is west of Laclede County (MO), not east of it, and therefore answers

        must be east of Cimarron County (OK) - not the other way around." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Cimarron County, OK located east of Haralson County, GA?"

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cimarron County
        is west of Haralson County, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reasoning is that "Oklahoma is entirely west of Georgia" and therefore "Cimarron
        County must be west of Haralson County, not east of it." This shows the model
        is noting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Sagadahoc County being east of East Baton Rouge Parish. The
        model says "Maine's position on the Atlantic seaboard puts all of its counties,
        including Sagadahoc, much further east than any parish in Louisiana" and "East
        Baton Rouge Parish is therefore west of Sagadahoc County, not east of it."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the question "Is East Baton Rouge Parish, LA located east

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cavalier County
        (ND) must be west of Cheboygan County (MI), not east." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality. The reason for the
        NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not that they are at
        the same location.

        Cavalier County is located) is west of Michigan (where Cheboygan County is
        located). The model concludes that "any county in North Dakota, including
        Cavalier County, would be west of Michigan counties, including Cheboygan County."
        The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, Cavalier County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Bates County is
        WEST of Seminole County, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Bates County, MO is not located east of Seminole
        County, FL. The model clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative
        question.
