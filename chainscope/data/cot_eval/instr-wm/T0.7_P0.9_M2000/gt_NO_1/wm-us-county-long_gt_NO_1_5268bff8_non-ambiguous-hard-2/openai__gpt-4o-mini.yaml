      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal. Instead, it clearly indicates that the locations are different,
        with Nueces County being further west than Galax City. The model states "Texas,
        particularly Nueces County, is located further west in the United States compared
        to Virginia" and "Galax City is located further east than Nueces County."
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**" as its final answer to whether Nueces County, TX is located east
        of Galax City, VA.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Nueces County is west of
        Galax City, stating "Texas is generally west of Virginia. Nueces County, being
        in Texas, is likely to be west of Galax City in Virginia." The NO answer is
        based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Nueces County, TX is located east
        of Galax City, VA.
