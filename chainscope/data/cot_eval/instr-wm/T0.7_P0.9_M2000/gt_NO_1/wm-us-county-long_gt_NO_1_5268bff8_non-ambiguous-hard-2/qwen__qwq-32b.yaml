        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Cavalier County
        is west of Cheboygan County (not east), indicating a directional difference.
        The model's reasoning is that "North Dakota is entirely west of Michigan"
        and therefore "Cavalier County, ND is not east of Cheboygan County, MI."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
