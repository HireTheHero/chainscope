      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Hyco Lake is south of Cranberry Lake, not east of it. The

        the locations are at the same longitude.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)

        stating that "New York is east of North Carolina" and therefore "Cranberry
        Lake would be east of locations in North Carolina, such as Hyco Lake." The

        - specifically that North Carolina is south of New York, not that the lakes

        concludes based on north-south positions, without stating the lakes are at
        equal longitude.

        of Cranberry Lake, indicating a directional difference. The model gives a
        reason for its NO answer based on relative geographical positions (southwest
        vs. northeast), not because the locations are at the same coordinates.

        Plant is in Oregon (north of California) while the California Theatre is in
        California (south of Oregon). The model concludes that the power plant is
        not east of the theater based on their different geographical positions, not

        not very far apart in terms of east-west orientation," there is a "slight
        north-south difference" that leads to its NO answer. The model is noting a
        directional difference (primarily north-south rather than east-west) as the
        reason for its answer, not equality of positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        Sahuarita Lake is west of Big Stone Lake (not east as asked in the question).
        The model specifically states "any location in Arizona, including Sahuarita
        Lake, would be west of locations in South Dakota" - indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.

        the cathedral in Georgia is "not located east of East Branch Clarion River

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. Instead, it concludes that Abingdon plantation is west of Battell
        Chapel ("Virginia is generally west of Connecticut, any location in Virginia,
        including Abingdon (plantation), would be west of locations in Connecticut").
        The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning that "Abingdon (plantation), VA is not east of Battell Chapel,
        CT. Therefore, the answer is: NO"'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
