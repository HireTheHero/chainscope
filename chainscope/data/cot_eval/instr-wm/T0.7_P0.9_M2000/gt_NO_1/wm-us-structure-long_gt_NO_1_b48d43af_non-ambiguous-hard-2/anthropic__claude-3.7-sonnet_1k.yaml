        question asked. The model explicitly states a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        directly answering whether the Civic Center Music Hall is located east of
        Bull Shoals Dam. The model explains that since Oklahoma is west of Arkansas,
        the Civic Center Music Hall (in Oklahoma) must be west (not east) of Bull
        Shoals Dam (in Arkansas).

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Cathedral is west (not east) of the Basilica, based on the geographic
        positions of Illinois and New York. The model explicitly states "the Cathedral
        must be west (not east) of the Basilica" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that St. Paul's Cathedral
        is WEST of El Vado Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two
        locations. The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the
        other, not that they are in the same location or have equal coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, indicating that St. Paul''s Cathedral in San

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with Connecticut being east of Virginia. The model concludes that
        Battell Chapel (in CT) would be east of Abingdon plantation (in VA), not the
        other way around. The NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abingdon plantation is not east of Battell Chapel.
        This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different east-west positions, with Abingdon plantation being WEST of Battell
        Chapel (not east of it). The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abingdon plantation, VA is not located east of Battell
        Chapel, CT. The model clearly provides a negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Abingdon is located
        to the west of Battell Chapel, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states in its conclusion: "NO,
        Abingdon (plantation), VA is NOT located east of Battell Chapel, CT. It is
        located to the west of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        positions, with Connecticut being east of Virginia, and therefore Battell
        Chapel being east of Abingdon plantation (not the other way around). The NO
        answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abingdon plantation is not east of Battell Chapel.
        The model clearly provides a comparative result with a definitive NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Abingdon plantation
        would be west of Battell Chapel, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model's reasoning is that Connecticut is further east
        than Virginia, making the locations different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Abingdon plantation, VA is located east of Battell Chapel, CT.
        The answer is explicitly stated at the end of the response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Abingdon plantation
        is west of Battell Chapel, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer
        is based on this directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of
        positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Abingdon plantation
        in Virginia is not located east of Battell Chapel in Connecticut. It is located
        west of it." This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
