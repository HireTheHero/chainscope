      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hyco Lake is southwest
        of Cranberry Lake" and concludes that Hyco Lake is NOT east of Cranberry Lake
        because of this directional difference. The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.

        The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Hyco Lake is west
        of Cranberry Lake, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Hyco Lake is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO based on geographical reasoning
        that "Hyco Lake is in North Carolina (south) and Cranberry Lake is in New
        York (north), Hyco Lake is NOT east of Cranberry Lake." The model is making
        a directional claim about relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hyco Lake would be west
        and south of Cranberry Lake" - indicating a directional difference (west vs
        east). The model is saying NO because Hyco Lake is in the opposite direction
        (west) of what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't verify the information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot confirm the location, not as a comparative result. The model states
        "I cannot confirm the location, so I cannot affirm the statement is true"
        which indicates it lacks information to make the comparison. This falls under
        the UNKNOWN category since the model is indicating it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to
        lack of information about one of the locations. The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison because it cannot confirm the location of the "Binoculars
        Building."

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it lacks verifiable information
        to make the comparison, mentioning "lack of verifiable information" and that
        it "cannot definitively state whether Binoculars Building is east of Horseshoe
        Lake." The NO answer is based on inability to verify the comparison, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "If forced to give a
        binary answer, I would say: NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the
        same, but rather because it couldn't verify the existence or location of one
        of the places.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot determine the answer because
        it cannot verify if the "Binoculars Building" exists or where it is located.
        The model states "I cannot confirm the location exists, so I cannot confirm
        its geographic position relative to Horseshoe Lake." This is a case where
        the model is rejecting its ability to make the comparison due to lack of information.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it gave what appears
        to be a NO answer based on inability to verify the locations, but this was
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "my answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response. However, the reasoning leading up to this answer
        indicates the model cannot determine the relationship between the locations
        due to lack of information. The model states "I cannot confidently answer
        YES or NO" but then contradicts itself by giving a NO answer. Since the model
        is rejecting the premises of the question and indicating it cannot make the
        comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Binoculars Building is
        in California, which is west of Arizona where Horseshoe Lake is located. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (California being west of Arizona,
        not east), not on equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values being compared are the

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Tappan Lake is west

        Court Building. The model is noting a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it determines that Blue Canyon Wind Farm
        is west of Tellico Reservoir, not east of it. The model explicitly states
        "Blue Canyon Wind Farm is west of Tellico Reservoir, NOT east of Tellico Reservoir."
        This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        identified a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that the statement is false. The model determined that Blue

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Nichols Hall, KS located east of Bellefonte Nuclear Plant,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Abingdon, VA is west of Battell
        Chapel, CT" which indicates a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response. It clearly concludes that Abingdon is NOT east of Battell
        Chapel, CT.'

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Abingdon is west
        of Battell Chapel, indicating a directional difference between their locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference (west vs east), not
        on equality of values.

        to the question "Is Abingdon (plantation), VA located east of Battell Chapel,
