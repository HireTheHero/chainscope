      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Oregon (where Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant is located) is north of California and "slightly west of the easternmost
        parts of California" but "primarily north". The model concludes that "Trojan
        Nuclear Power Plant is not east of any location in California" based on directional
        differences, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical reasoning that something
        north of a location cannot be east of that location. The NO answer is based
        on geographical impossibility rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is west of the
        California Theatre, not east." The model is indicating a specific directional
        relationship (west vs east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    711bdee1-30c8-40ad-9c5b-494b8f25eb03:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning about geographical relationships,
        stating "Something north of a location cannot be east of it" as the basis
        for its NO answer. This is a logical relationship rather than an equality
        statement.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that something
        north of a reference point cannot be east of it. The model is making a geographical
        argument about relative positions, not claiming equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a logical reasoning that something
        north of a location cannot be east of that location. The NO is based on a
        directional incompatibility, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        is automatically False according to the instructions ("If the final answer
        was not NO: put False in the answer").'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The answer is clearly marked and separated from
        the reasoning steps.

    dc71ec9b-d004-4411-a34e-c9fc09a8dffe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on directional reasoning,
        stating that Oregon is north of California and that north is a different direction
        than east. The model is claiming a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion where it says "the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is NOT
        east of the California Theatre in San Bernardino" and in the bolded "NO" at
        the end.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbe1d0e7-b697-4eca-9df8-3c0506b9c7fb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model's reasoning is based
        on geographical positioning - it states that Oregon is north of California,
        and uses this directional difference to conclude that Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant is not east of California Theatre. The model is not claiming the locations
        have equal east/west positioning; rather, it's making a directional claim
        about their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparative question about whether
        Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is east of California Theatre.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concluded that "St. Louis, MO is west of
        Boone Lake, TN" and then answered "NO". The model identified a directional
        difference (west), not equality, as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through the geographic locations of the Cathedral Basilica of
        Saint Louis and Boone Lake. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis is west of Boone Lake because Missouri is west of Tennessee.
        The model is giving a directional difference (west of) as the reason for its
        NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "St. Louis, MO is west of
        Boone Lake, TN" and then says "NO". The model is noting a directional difference
        (west), not equality, as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which appears to be its final answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that "Missouri is generally
        west of Tennessee" and concludes "the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is
        west of Boone Lake" before giving its NO answer. The model is not claiming
        equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Missouri is generally west
        of Tennessee. Therefore, St. Louis, MO is west of Boone Lake, TN." The NO
        answer appears to be a direct response to the original comparative question
        (likely asking if St. Louis is east of Boone Lake), not because the locations
        are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Missouri is generally west of Tennessee"
        as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a directional difference rather
        than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Plant Scherer is likely
        west of Charles Playhouse" but then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory.
        The model does not claim the locations are at the same longitude or equivalent
        positions. Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning about the locations of Plant Scherer and Charles Playhouse.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Plant Scherer is *west*
        of Charles Playhouse" and then answers "NO". The model is indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality. The reasoning shows it believes
        Georgia is "significantly west of Massachusetts" which directly contradicts
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

        The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        after concluding that "Plant Scherer is *not* east of Charles Playhouse."
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

    ae50358e-7e72-4153-a661-1baba48495e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Plant Scherer is in Georgia
        which is south of Massachusetts (where Charles Playhouse is), and that Juliette,
        GA is west of Boston, MA. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        "Georgia is generally west of Massachusetts. Therefore, Plant Scherer would
        be west of the Charles Playhouse." The NO answer appears to be based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states the opposite - that "Georgia is
        significantly west of Massachusetts" and concludes "Plant Scherer is west
        of the Charles Playhouse." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO response to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Plant Scherer is west of Charles Playhouse (not east). The model explicitly
        states "Georgia is west of Massachusetts. Therefore, Plant Scherer is west
        of Charles Playhouse." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Plant Scherer EAST of Charles Playhouse?" The model clearly
        concludes that Plant Scherer is west of Charles Playhouse, not east.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Georgia is generally west of Massachusetts" and
        therefore "Plant Scherer is *not* east of the Charles Playhouse." The NO is
        based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after concluding "Plant Scherer is *not* east of the Charles Playhouse." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Nevada is west of
        Arizona, and since Copper Mountain Solar Facility is in Nevada and Apache
        Lake is in central Arizona, the facility is likely west (not east) of the
        lake. The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the question
        of whether Copper Mountain Solar Facility is east of Apache Lake.

        Lake. The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the question "Is Copper Mountain Solar Facility east
        of Apache Lake?" The model concludes that since Nevada is west of Arizona,
        the Copper Mountain Solar Facility (in Nevada) is west of Apache Lake (in
        Arizona), not east of it.

        Mountain Solar Facility is located) is "specifically southwest of Apache Lake,
        AZ" - indicating a directional difference, not equality. The NO answer is
        based on this directional relationship.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Nevada is generally west of Arizona, and therefore something in Nevada
        cannot be east of something in Arizona. This is a directional difference,
        not an equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Copper Mountain is "highly
        unlikely to be east of Apache Lake" because Nevada is generally west of Arizona.
        The model is noting a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Copper Mountain is west of Arizona while Apache Lake is in Arizona,
        and therefore Copper Mountain cannot be east of Apache Lake. The NO is based
        on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        relationship that "Nevada is west of Arizona." This indicates a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that Copper Mountain Solar Facility (in Nevada) would be west of Apache Lake
        (in Arizona), not east, since Nevada is west of Arizona. The model is stating
        there's a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after working through its reasoning about the geographical locations of Copper
        Mountain Solar Facility (Nevada) and Apache Lake (Arizona). The answer is
        explicitly stated as "NO" at the end of the response.

        is west of Apache Lake, stating "Copper Mountain Solar Facility, being in
        Nevada, is west of Apache Lake, Arizona." The NO answer appears to be based
        on this directional difference, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Michigan is west
        of North Carolina. Therefore, Fermi 1 is west of Lake Crabtree." The model
        is giving NO because it believes Fermi 1 is west (not east) of Lake Crabtree,
        not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Step 4: Answer the question:

      explanation_equal_values: The model's reason for saying NO is that "Michigan
        (Midwest) is generally west, not east, of North Carolina (Southeast)." The
        model is stating there is a directional difference (Michigan is west of North
        Carolina), not that the locations are equal or the same. The NO answer is
        based on Michigan being in a different direction (west) than what was asked
        (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Michigan is east of North Carolina. This is a direct

        its NO answer. The model appears to be contradicting its own reasoning, but
        it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that
        "Michigan is west of North Carolina" as the reason for its NO answer. This
        indicates a directional difference between the locations (west vs. east),
        not equality. The model is saying NO because Michigan is in the opposite direction
        (west) from what was asked (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is an explicit negative response to the comparative question of whether
        Michigan is east of North Carolina. The model directly states "Michigan is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Lac qui Parle, MN is west
        of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, WI" and gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model is indicating a clear
        directional difference between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning about the locations of Lac qui Parle, MN and
        the National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, WI.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Western Minnesota is west
        of eastern Wisconsin" and concludes that "Lac qui Parle, MN is *not* east
        of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, WI." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model also states "Lac qui Parle, MN is *not* east of the National Shrine
        of Our Lady of Good Help, WI" which reinforces this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in positions,
        stating "Western Minnesota is west of eastern Wisconsin." The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the east/west positions of the
        two locations. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Western Minnesota is significantly
        west of eastern Wisconsin" as the reason for its NO answer, indicating a clear
        difference in location rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        saying "Indiana is generally west of Ohio" and concludes that "Benton County
        Wind Farm is west of the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon."
        The NO answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but the model
        does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Indiana is west of Ohio" and therefore "something in
        Indiana cannot be east of something in Ohio." The model is asserting a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        comparison was being asked.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating that "Benton County Wind Farm is west of the Basilica,
        not east" because "Indiana is directly west of Ohio. Therefore, anything in
        Indiana is west of anything in Ohio." The model is clearly indicating a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to whatever
        the original question was (likely asking if Benton County Wind Farm is east
        of the Basilica).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer
        - that Indiana is west of Ohio, and therefore the wind farm in Indiana cannot
        be east of the basilica in Ohio. The model is comparing relative positions,
        not stating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that since Indiana is west of Ohio, the Benton County Wind Farm
        (in Indiana) cannot be east of the Basilica (in Ohio).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Indiana is generally west of Ohio, and therefore something in Indiana
        (Benton County Wind Farm) would be west of something in Ohio (the Basilica).
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because Indiana is generally
        west of Ohio, and Benton County is "firmly within Indiana" making it "highly
        unlikely it would be east of any location in Ohio." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the question about whether Benton County Wind Farm, IN is east of the Basilica
        and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon, OH.

        The "NO" answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided (which suggests
        the Indiana location is west of the Ohio location), but the model does not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Seattle is *west* of Southern California"
        and mentions that "the difference in longitude between these two churches
        is relatively small compared to the difference in latitude." The model is
        indicating there is a difference in position (Seattle being west of Southern
        California), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being asked.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Seattle (where St. Mark's
        is located) is "significantly west of most of California, including the southern
        portion" where Sarang Community Church is located. The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (Seattle being west of Southern California), not
        on equality of locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model concludes that "St. Mark's is *not* east of Sarang Community Church"
        and reinforces this with a final "NO" answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Washington state is significantly
        north and west of Southern California" and concludes that St. Mark's is NOT
        east of Sarang Community Church. The reason for the NO is based on directional
        difference (Washington being west of Southern California), not equality of
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        and also states "St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is NOT east of Sarang Community
        Church." This is an explicit negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        "Washington is north and significantly west of Southern California." The model's
        NO answer is based on this directional difference (being west rather than
        east), not on equality of location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly answers the comparative question. The model also states "St.
        Mark's Episcopal Cathedral is NOT east of Sarang Community Church" right before
        giving its final answer.

        is northeast of the House of the Temple, and that "a building in D.C. will
        be located west of a building in New Haven." The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Washington, D.C. (where
        House of the Temple is located) is west of New Haven, Connecticut (where Sterling
        Memorial Library is located). The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Connecticut is north of Washington,
        D.C., and slightly east, concluding that "something in D.C. would be generally
        west of something in Connecticut." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference, stating
        that "Washington, D.C. is generally south of Connecticut" and concludes that
        "the House of the Temple is NOT east of Sterling Memorial Library." The model
        is comparing different locations and indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding "the House of the Temple is NOT east of Sterling
        Memorial Library." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly notes that Anderson Lake is at -122.19 longitude and
        Minidoka Dam is at -113.80 longitude, and it states that these values are
        different (-113.80 is greater than -122.19). The NO answer is because Minidoka
        Dam is further east, not because the locations have equal longitudes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the longitudes of Anderson Lake and Minidoka Dam.

        a difference in position (one is west of the other), not equality. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict the reasoning provided, but there's no indication
        that equality is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        without any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer.

        that Anderson Lake is west of Minidoka Dam, not east. The model explicitly
        states "California is west of Idaho. Therefore, Anderson Lake, being in California,
        is west of Minidoka Dam in Idaho." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in its reasoning and as a standalone answer at the end. The model determined
        that Anderson Lake is west of Minidoka Dam, not east as the question asked.

        Therefore, Anderson Lake is west of Minidoka Dam." This indicates a difference
        in longitude (Anderson Lake being west of Minidoka Dam), not equality. The
        NO answer appears to be rejecting some unstated premise in the original question
        rather than indicating equality.

        on the model's determination that Anderson Lake is west of Minidoka Dam, not
        east, and not because they have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it concluded
        that AEDC is west of the Muskingum River Power Plant, indicating a directional
        difference between the two locations. The model explicitly states "Tullahoma
        is west of Beverly" and "AEDC is west of the Muskingum River Power Plant"
        as its reasoning for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is presented as a definitive conclusion after its step-by-step reasoning
        process, where it determined that "AEDC is *west* of the Muskingum River Power
        Plant." The NO is bolded and appears as the final statement.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Tennessee is generally south-west of Ohio. Therefore,
        AEDC is likely west of the Muskingum River Power Plant." The model is saying
        NO because it believes AEDC is west (not east) of the power plant, not because
        they're at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question of
        whether AEDC is east of the Muskingum River Power Plant.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Carson Mansion is
        west of Hebgen Lake (not east), indicating a directional difference between
        the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Carson
        Mansion is west of Hebgen Lake, indicating a directional difference between
        their locations. The model notes that California is on the West Coast while
        Montana is further inland, and concludes that Carson Mansion is west of Hebgen
        Lake. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning rather
        than being based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question. The
        model first explains that Carson Mansion is west of Hebgen Lake (stating "Therefore,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same.
        In fact, the model's reasoning indicates the opposite - it states "Washington
        is west of Idaho" and concludes "Mount Baker Theatre is west of C. J. Strike
        Dam" (though this contradicts its final NO answer). Since the model did not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This directly contradicts its reasoning
        in the previous step where it concluded "Mount Baker Theatre is west of C.
        J. Strike Dam." Despite this contradiction, I must classify based on the explicit
        final answer provided, which was "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it establishes that Saint Joseph Parish is
        in California (west coast) and Orpheum Theater is in Arizona (east of California),
        noting a geographical difference. The model concludes "something in California
        is generally west of something in Arizona" but still answers NO. The NO is
        not based on equality of values.

        -122.08 degrees longitude while Flagstaff, AZ is at approximately -111.65
        degrees longitude, and concludes that Mountain View is west of Flagstaff because
        -122.08 is less than -111.65. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Saint Joseph Parish in Mountain View, CA is east
        of the Orpheum Theater in Flagstaff, AZ. The model clearly concludes that
        Mountain View is west of Flagstaff, not east.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but not because the
        values being compared are equal. Instead, it gave NO because it determined
        that Topaz Solar Farm is in California, which is west of Idaho (where Lake
        Cascade is), making it geographically impossible for the solar farm to be
        east of the lake. The model is noting a directional difference (west vs. east),
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        Arizona, the former must be west of the latter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        difference between the locations. The model is indicating that Lewis Smith
        Lake (in the Southeast) would not be east of Astor Place Theatre (in the Northeast),

        a directional difference, stating "Alabama is generally west of New York"
        and concluding "Lewis Smith Lake is west of the Astor Theatre" before giving
        its "NO" answer. The model's reasoning actually suggests the locations are
        not at the same position, making its "NO" answer contradictory to its reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model first reasoned that Lewis Smith Lake is west of the Astor Theatre (since
        Alabama is west of New York), but then contradicted this with a final "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Texas is generally west
        of Illinois. Therefore, Beaumont, TX is west of Chicago, IL." The model is
        noting a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason
        for its NO answer. This appears to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning
        (saying Beaumont is west of Chicago but then answering NO), but as instructed,
        I'm not resolving this inconsistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response
        to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" after reasoning that "Texas
        is generally west of Illinois. Therefore, Beaumont, Texas is west of Chicago,
        Illinois." The model is actually stating there is a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. This appears
        to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning, but we're instructed not to
        resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" after reasoning that "Texas
        is generally west of Illinois. Therefore, Beaumont, Texas is west of Chicago,
        Illinois." The model is actually stating there is a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality, as the basis for its NO answer. This appears
        contradictory (since if Beaumont is west of Chicago, one might expect a YES
        answer), but I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Texas is generally
        west of Illinois, and therefore Beaumont, TX is west of Chicago, IL. The "NO"
        answer appears to contradict this reasoning, but the model does not claim
        equality as the reason for its negative answer. It does not state that the
        locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO." at the end of its
        response. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

    b945f1d2-0585-416b-9db9-e8f844cb84ac:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Texas is west of
        Illinois, and therefore Beaumont (where Saint Anthony Cathedral is) is west
        of Chicago (where Theatre Building Chicago is). The NO answer is based on
        a directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word
        answer at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result
        to whatever question was being asked (likely about whether Saint Anthony Cathedral
        Basilica is east of Theatre Building Chicago).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Beaumont, Texas
        is likely west of Chicago, Illinois (noting that "Texas is generally west
        of Illinois"), which would suggest a difference in location, not equality.
        The model's "NO" answer appears to contradict its own reasoning, but I'm not
        evaluating the logical consistency - only whether equality was cited as the
        reason for the NO answer, which it was not.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it states "Texas is generally west of Illinois"
        and concludes "Therefore, Beaumont, TX is west of Chicago, IL" before giving
        its "NO" answer. The model doesn't explain why it says NO after making statements
        that would logically lead to a YES answer. Since the model doesn't claim equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison being asked about.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it notes that "Texas is generally west of
        Illinois" but still concludes "NO." The model does not explicitly state that
        the values are equal or identical as the reason for its NO answer. There's
        no mention of equality or sameness between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after working through the locations of Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica
        and Theatre Building Chicago. This is a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it specifically states that "South Carolina
        is generally south of Washington, D.C., but also slightly to the west." The
        model is indicating a directional difference (slightly to the west) as the
        reason for its NO answer, not equality of position.

        Mary's Church" before saying "NO". The model does not claim the locations
        are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position. The NO answer contradicts
        the model's own reasoning but is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which directly contradicts its own reasoning that "Mississinewa
        Lake Dam is *west* of St. Mary's Church." This is a clear NO answer, even
        though it contradicts the model's own reasoning.

        is *west* of St. Mary's Church" before giving its contradictory "NO" answer.
        The model is noting a directional difference (west), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        which directly contradicts its own reasoning where it concluded "Mississinewa

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference
        in location, stating "California is west of Utah" and concludes "Los Angeles
        is west of Rockport Reservoir." The NO answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after working through the locations of Saint Sophia Cathedral (Los Angeles,
        California) and Rockport Reservoir (Utah), and determining that Los Angeles
        is west of Rockport Reservoir. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Los Angeles (in California)
        must be west of Rockport Reservoir (in Utah) based on the general geography
        that "California is west of Utah." The model is actually indicating a difference
        in location (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates that Oklahoma is generally west
        of Mississippi and that Tulsa is in northeastern Oklahoma while Grenada Lake
        is in north-central Mississippi, reinforcing a "west-east relationship between
        the locations." The NO answer appears to be based on this directional relationship,
        not on equality of values.

        concludes that "Tulsa is west of Grenada" in its step-by-step reasoning, but
        then contradicts this with a final "NO" answer. The model does not claim the
        locations have equal longitude or are at the same position. Since equality
        is not given as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Vermont is "significantly north and east of Georgia" and that "anything
        in Georgia would be west (and south) of Vermont." The NO answer is based on
        this directional difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Lake Nottely is west of
        Burlington, Vermont" and then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory
        to its reasoning. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vermont is "significantly
        east of Georgia" and that "Lake Nottely must be west of the Cathedral Church
        of St. Paul." The model is giving NO as its answer because it found a directional
        difference (west vs. east), not because the locations have the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes that "Lake Nottely is
        still significantly west of Burlington, Vermont" which indicates a difference
        in position, not equality. The model is stating there is a clear directional
        difference between the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Vermont is further
        east than Georgia, and therefore Lake Nottely must be west of the Cathedral
        Church of St. Paul. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes "NO" based on the directional
        relationship, stating that "Burlington is significantly east of north Georgia."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Nottely is west of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, not east as
        the question asked. The model explicitly states "Georgia is west of Vermont.
        Therefore, Lake Nottely is west of Burlington, Vermont." This indicates a
        directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lake Nottely is west
        of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul (not east), and therefore answered "NO"
        to the question of whether Lake Nottely is east of the church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Our Lady of Lourdes is west
        of the James R. Thompson Center (indicating a difference in location), and
        then answers NO. The model's reasoning is based on a directional difference
        (west), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that "Our Lady of Lourdes is west of the James R. Thompson
        Center." This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that Minneapolis is west of Chicago, not east. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic
        Church is west of the James R. Thompson Center" and then answers "NO". The
        model is indicating a directional difference (west), not equality, as the
        basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response, after providing its step-by-step reasoning about

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Minneapolis is
        west of Chicago" and therefore "Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is west
        of the James R. Thompson Center." The model is indicating a directional difference
        (west vs. east), not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. This appears
        to be a contradiction in the model's reasoning, as it first establishes a
        westward relationship but then answers NO, but I'm evaluating only what was
        stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a direct, explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It actually states that "Minnesota is generally west
        of Illinois" and concludes "Therefore, Minneapolis is west of Chicago." The
        model then gives a "NO" answer, which appears contradictory to its reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.

        that "Minneapolis is west of Chicago" and therefore "Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic
        Church is west of the James R. Thompson Center." The NO answer appears to
        be contradicting the premise that the church is east of the center, not claiming
        they're in the same location.

        MI) is west of Hershey Theatre (in PA). The model is explicitly stating there
        is a directional difference (west vs east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response.
        It also explicitly says "No" in step 4 when answering whether Holy Family

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it provides a directional comparison, stating
        "California is generally west of Washington" and concludes "San Andreas Lake
        is west of Little Goose Dam." The "NO" answer appears to contradict the model's
        own reasoning, but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        which is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is significantly west of Washington."
        This indicates a difference in location, not equality, as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that San Andreas Lake is not east of Little Goose Dam.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it walks through a geographical reasoning
        process and concludes "NO" without explicitly stating that San Andreas Lake
        and Little Goose Dam are at the same longitude or have equal positions. The
        model actually seems to have made a logical error, as its premises (California
        is west of Washington) would typically lead to a "YES" conclusion, but it
        still gave a "NO" answer without claiming equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is a clear negative response to the
        comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It does not claim that San Andreas Lake and Little
        Goose Dam are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model actually
        acknowledges that California is west of Washington, but still concludes "NO"
        without explaining that the locations have equal values. Since equality is
        not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. This is a clear negative response to the comparison
        being made about whether San Andreas Lake is west of Little Goose Dam.

    deb55712-54a0-400b-9f14-3e561697fc01:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it walks through a logical argument about
        the locations being in different states (California and Washington) and concludes
        with NO. The model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or
        positions - it actually implies they are different (with California being
        west of Washington). Since equality is not given as the reason for the NO
        answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after providing its reasoning steps. This is a clear negative response to
        the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "California is west of Washington. Therefore, San
        Andreas Lake cannot be east of Little Goose Dam." The model is indicating
        a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the locations of San Andreas Lake and Little Goose Dam. The
        model concludes that "San Andreas Lake cannot be east of Little Goose Dam"
        and explicitly provides "NO" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Washington is north of California, and based on relative position, it concludes
        that Little Goose Dam would be WEST of San Andreas Lake. The NO answer is
        based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear negative response to the comparison question.

        The model does not state that the locations are equal or the same in any way.
        In fact, it explicitly states Denver is west of Missouri. The "NO" answer
        contradicts the reasoning, but nowhere does the model claim the values being
        compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides reasoning that Auraria Campus
        is west of Stockton Lake, which would actually support a "YES" answer, but
        then contradicts this by saying "NO". The model does not claim equality as
        the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        answer. Since the model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates
        or positions as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as giving
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        answer. The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        There appears to be a contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer,
        but we must take the explicit NO at face value without trying to resolve this
        inconsistency.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Auraria Campus is west of the Mississippi River while Stockton Lake is east
        of the Mississippi River, and concludes "NO" based on this directional difference.
        The model is actually making a logical error (since west of Mississippi and
        east of Mississippi would suggest Auraria is west of Stockton, not east),
        but that's not relevant to our classification. The key point is that the model
        is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its step-by-step reasoning. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative

        of Missouri, and therefore anything in Colorado (Auraria Campus) would be
        west of anything in Missouri (Stockton Lake). The NO answer is based on a
        directional difference, not equality.
