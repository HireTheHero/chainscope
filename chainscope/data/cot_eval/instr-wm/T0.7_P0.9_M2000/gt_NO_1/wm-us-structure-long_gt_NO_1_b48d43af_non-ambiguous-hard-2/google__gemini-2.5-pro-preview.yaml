        further west than Mississippi" and concludes that "Fitzsimons Army Medical
        Center in Colorado is located west of Mammy's Cupboard in Mississippi." The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Fitzsimons Army Medical Center is east of Mammy's
        Cupboard. The model explains that Fitzsimons is in Colorado which is west

        states "Since Los Angeles is west of Panguitch Lake, the answer is no." This
        indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        is based on the geographical difference between the states, not on equality
        of the locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the locations have different positions, with Ohio being west of Massachusetts
        (not east). The model explicitly states "Massachusetts is located significantly
        east of Ohio" and "Ohio is west of Massachusetts," indicating a clear directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is west of Massachusetts.

        of Massachusetts, not east as the question asked. The model explicitly states
        "Ohio is located in the Midwest region of the US" and "Massachusetts is located
        on the East Coast" and concludes "The Midwest (Ohio) is west of the East Coast
        (Massachusetts)." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Parker Canyon Lake
        is west of Richland-Chambers Reservoir, indicating a directional difference.
        The model says "Parker Canyon Lake is west of Richland-Chambers Reservoir"
        and "Parker Canyon Lake is significantly further west than Richland-Chambers
        Reservoir," which clearly indicates different geographical positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Parker Canyon Lake, AZ is not east of Richland-Chambers Reservoir,
        TX. The model provides a direct and explicit negative answer to the comparative
        question.

        between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Parker Canyon Lake is east of Richland-Chambers
        Reservoir. The model provides reasoning that Parker Canyon Lake is in Arizona
        which is west of Texas where Richland-Chambers Reservoir is located.

        is west of Bunch-of-Grapes, not east as asked in the question. The model explicitly
        states "Pleasants Power Station is west of Bunch-of-Grapes" as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Power Station (in WV). The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        is based on this directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement is false because Beaumont (where Ford Park

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Gibson Generating
        Station is west of 41 Cooper Square, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the two locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Gibson Generating Station is east of 41 Cooper
        Square. The model explains that Gibson Generating Station is in Indiana (west
        of New York) while 41 Cooper Square is in New York, and concludes that Gibson
        Generating Station is west of 41 Cooper Square, not east.

        of 41 Cooper Square (in New York). The NO answer is based on a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        The reason for the NO answer is that the premise of the question (suggesting
        Gibson is east of 41 Cooper Square) is incorrect according to the model's
        geographical reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that the statement "Saint Sophia Cathedral is east of Rockport

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Detroit is west of Lewiston, not east as the question asked. The model
        explicitly states "Detroit, MI, is therefore located significantly west of
        Lewiston, ME" and "Detroit is west of Lewiston." The model is identifying
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Detroit, MI is west

        Church is west of Lensic Theater, not east as the question asked. The model
        identified a directional difference, not equality.
