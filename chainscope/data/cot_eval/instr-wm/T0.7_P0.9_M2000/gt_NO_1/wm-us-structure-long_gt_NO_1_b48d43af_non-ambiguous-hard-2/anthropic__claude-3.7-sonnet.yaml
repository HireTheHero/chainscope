        of Piqua Nuclear Generating Station. The model explicitly states "any location
        in Kansas (including Hillsdale Lake) would be west of any location in Ohio
        (including Piqua Nuclear Generating Station)" and concludes that if Hillsdale
        Lake is west, it cannot be east of Piqua Nuclear Generating Station.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly "NO" at the end
        of its response. It concludes that Hillsdale Lake cannot be east of Piqua
        Nuclear Generating Station because it determined that Hillsdale Lake (in Kansas)
        is west of Piqua Nuclear Generating Station (in Ohio).

        different, with North Lake being west of Griffy Lake. The model gives a directional
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model is clearly rejecting the premise that
        North Lake (Dallas), TX is located east of Griffy Lake, IN, and instead concludes
        that North Lake is west of Griffy Lake.

        that the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is west of the Basilica of Regina
        Pacis, not east of it. The model explicitly states "Illinois is west of New
        York" and concludes that the Cathedral "is west of Basilica of Regina Pacis
        in New York, not east of it." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        further east than Illinois" and that "Joliet, Illinois would be west of New
        York, not east of it." The model is clearly indicating a difference in positions
        (one is west of the other), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, the Cathedral of
        St. Raymond Nonnatus in Joliet, Illinois is NOT located east of the Basilica

        being compared are the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined
        that Pleasants Power Station is west of Bunch-of-Grapes, not east of it. The
        model identified a directional difference (west vs. east) rather than stating
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Pleasants Power
