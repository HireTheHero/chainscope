      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. The model did not make any comparison between values or state that
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" after explaining that without access to a map, it cannot determine
        the relative positions of Hyco Lake and Cranberry Lake. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any determination about whether the values being compared are
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer
        but did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with
        "Let me know if you'd like me to help with the actual location details" indicating
        it did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine the answer because it doesn't
        have access to a map. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "We cannot determine YES
        or NO without a map" and indicates it's "impossible to know the answer definitively"
        without a map. The model is clearly indicating it cannot make the comparison
        without additional information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps for how one might approach
        answering the question (identifying locations, looking at a map, considering
        directions) but did not actually provide a conclusion. The response ends by
        offering to help guide through the reasoning process, indicating the model
        did not complete the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it could not have given
        a NO answer because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it only outlined how one would approach
        answering the question (by identifying locations, determining relative positions,
        and using a map), but never actually provided a conclusion. The response ends
        with stating that "it's best to use a map to answer it" without giving the
        answer itself.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it only outlined steps to find the information
        needed to make the comparison, suggesting the user look up the locations online.
        The model did not commit to any conclusion about the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a104dbee-e3e5-47bd-ac6b-8f692cee42ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer.
        Instead, it states "Based on the given information, you can't determine the
        answer." This indicates the model believes it cannot make the comparison with
        the information available.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    c873389b-b8af-4a30-b6c1-84fb7c2889a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was UNKNOWN),
        according to the instructions, I must put False for this question. The model
        did not make any comparison about equality or difference between the lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem (locate
        both lakes and compare them) but did not actually complete the comparison
        or provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know if you need help
        with this!" which indicates the model did not make a determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f32288f1-60a4-431a-b171-ce6d3337da61:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, this must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" because it lacks the visual reference needed to determine the geographical
        positioning of the lakes. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be False.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what amounts to an UNKNOWN answer due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies in parentheses that "We cannot definitively say yes or no based
        on the provided information." This indicates the model is actually expressing
        uncertainty rather than a definitive negative comparison. Since the model
        is stating it cannot determine the answer due to insufficient information,
        this falls under the UNKNOWN category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    384d338b-ad13-4fa9-87e0-b51c9c28f2b9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it reasons that a nuclear power
        plant is "unlikely to be located directly next to a theater" which implies
        a difference in location. The NO answer is based on this reasoning about different
        locations, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        without any qualifications or uncertainty. It provides reasoning about why
        a nuclear power plant would be unlikely to be located next to a theater, and
        then gives a clear "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    42dcc58d-1cbc-4ffe-b3c8-4019cd5e5020:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states "Without further information, we
        don't know if the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is east or west of the California
        Theatre" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates lack of information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, making a clear final determination.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    67079140-454f-4c04-9bfe-12f487ef3c50:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO but rather UNKNOWN
        (the model couldn't determine the answer due to lack of information), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO based on the provided information." This indicates the model is unable
        to make the comparison due to lack of information, which falls under the UNKNOWN
        category.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7d42d2f2-e9aa-4b11-9bc2-3cb8c96d4512:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is YES" as
        its final conclusion.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    8a173bb5-e700-4739-9d6d-f665c0645a4d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it provides geographical reasoning,
        stating that the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is in Southern California near
        Chino, while the California Theatre is in San Bernardino which is east of
        Chino. The NO answer appears to be based on this geographical relationship
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c8813e2c-d004-4c07-91df-5de943d1d8a8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it attempts to determine relative positions,
        suggesting the power plant would be "east" of the city. The NO answer is based
        on this directional reasoning, not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ca69dfdc-6747-4942-8bc7-55274639de1d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, making a clear affirmative judgment about
        the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    d77a1d17-da8c-4217-84de-83369dab76c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the second question automatically receives a False answer according
        to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "To answer the question, we
        need more information about the location of these two structures" and asks
        for additional information. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison
        with the information it has.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f384caef-2513-4179-a69f-b758256816da:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the question about equal values does not apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question without
        additional information" without providing a clear YES or NO answer. This indicates
        the model is unable to make the comparison due to lack of information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: 'The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly notes a difference: "The locations
        are in different states." This difference is the reason given for the NO answer.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Based on this, the answer
        is NO" and reaffirms this with "The locations are in different states, making
        the answer NO." The model is clearly providing NO as its final comparative
        answer.

        (the model stated it needs more information), this automatically results in
        False for this question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison. Instead, it states "I need more information to answer this

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparative question. Instead, it outlined steps to determine the answer
        but did not actually provide a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me
        know if you need help with these steps, and I can help you determine the answer!"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "the answer is likely
        NO" without providing any reason for this determination. It doesn't mention
        equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "Based on this process,
        the answer is likely NO." While it says "likely NO," this still constitutes
        a NO answer to the comparative question, as the model is making a determination
        about the comparison, even if with some uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide any specific reason
        for its NO answer - it mentions needing to use a map to determine relative
        location but doesn't share what it found or why it concluded NO. Since equality
        is not mentioned as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. While the model doesn't provide much reasoning,
        it does give a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't answer this question"
        because it needs more information about the exact location of Benton County
        Wind Farm. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to
        insufficient information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. The model's reasoning for
        the NO answer appears to be based on inability to determine the relative positions,
        not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially states "I cannot determine if
        Benton County Wind Farm is east or west of Basilica and National Shrine of
        Our Lady of Lebanon" which indicates uncertainty. However, it then concludes
        with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This creates a contradiction, but following
        the instructions to take what was explicitly stated at face value, the final
        explicit answer given was "NO."

        for this question according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "We cannot answer" as its final response.
        It does not provide a clear YES or NO answer, but rather indicates it cannot
        make the determination due to lack of map access. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        - that Lake Mohawk is in New Jersey and Watson Pond is in Massachusetts, meaning
        they are in different states. This difference in location is the reason for
        the NO answer, not equality of values.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer at all, let alone one based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to determine the
        answer (locate both lakes and compare them) but did not actually perform the
        comparison or state a conclusion. The response ends with "Let me know your
        answer!" suggesting the model is leaving the determination to the user.

        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states "NO" without providing
        any reasoning about equality or similarity between the locations. The model
        doesn't explain why the answer is NO, so there's no indication that equality
        is the reason.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that determining
        if North Lake is east or west of Griffy Lake would require knowing specific
        coordinates, but it doesn't claim they have the same coordinates or are at
        the same longitude. The model gives "NO" without explicitly stating the locations
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it does mention that determining the east/west relationship would require

        - that Texas and Indiana are in different geographical regions (southern vs.
        Midwest), making their locations "on different sides of the country." The

        indicating it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, not
        making a comparative judgment. The model states "it's impossible to definitively

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same - it gave
        what appears to be a NO answer but was actually indicating it couldn't determine
        the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the relationship because
        it lacks information about the locations. This is a case where the model says
        "NO" but actually means it cannot verify or determine the answer due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to
        lack of information about the locations. The model states "we cannot determine
        if Binoculars Building is located east of Horseshoe Lake" which indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison. This makes the actual

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that California and Arizona are "geographically distinct states" and that
        "A building in California would not be located in Arizona." The model is noting
        a difference between the locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it
        gave a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I need more information to

        Arizona is a state located in the southwest part of the US. Based on these
        facts, California is not east of Horseshoe Lake." This indicates a geographical

        - it claims that "Tennessee is located to the west of Nebraska," which indicates
        a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Without a map, it's impossible
        to determine the location of Lewis and Clark Lake in relation to Herb Parsons
        Lake" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates inability to make the
        comparison rather than equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was not NO, but rather a refusal
        to answer. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO,
        the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO without a map" and indicates it cannot determine the relative positions
        without a map. This is a clear refusal to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

        or NO" and indicates that "it's impossible to determine if Lewis and Clark
        Lake is east or west of Herb Parsons Lake." This shows the model is indicating
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to determine the answer
        (locate both lakes and compare their locations) but did not actually state
        a conclusion. The response ends with "Based on this reasoning, you'll be able

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it describes Nebraska as "located in the eastern
        part of the US" and Tennessee as "in the southeastern part" - implying they
        are in different locations. The NO answer is based on this geographical comparison,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes with "Therefore,
        **NO**" after its reasoning process.

        about equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly indicates it cannot answer the question
        without additional information about the locations of Old National Centre
        and O'Rourke's Diner. It explicitly states "I need more information" and requests
        addresses or locations. This is a refusal to provide a comparative answer

        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "Without a map, it's impossible
        to definitively answer" and "I need a map to determine if Parker Canyon Lake
        is located east of Richland-Chambers Reservoir." The model is indicating it
        cannot make the comparison without additional information (a map).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. While it identifies the locations (Parker
        Canyon Lake in Arizona and Richland-Chambers Reservoir in Texas), it doesn't
        complete its analysis to explain why the answer is NO. It doesn't claim the
        locations are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        this question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model
        did not make any comparison of values or state they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. It only outlined steps to solve the problem but
        did not execute those steps or reach a conclusion. The response ends with

        are equal, identical, or the same. It mentions that Parker Canyon Lake is
        in Arizona and Richland-Chambers Reservoir is in Texas, but doesn't explicitly
        state that they are at the same longitude or that equality is the reason for
        the NO answer. The model doesn't provide a clear reason for its NO answer
        beyond identifying the locations of the two lakes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the NO answer is
        based on the geographical locations of Arizona and Texas, concluding that
        Parker Canyon Lake would not be to the east of Richland-Chambers Reservoir
        (since Arizona is west of Texas). The model is making a directional comparison
        and finding a difference, not an equality.

        for the NO answer. It doesn't provide any statement about equality being the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response. While it doesn't provide a complete analysis, it

        Power Station is in West Virginia, which is to the east of Massachusetts."
        This indicates the model believes there is a directional difference, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on this perceived directional difference.

        - indicating a difference in location (different states) as the reason for
        the negative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that West Virginia is in the eastern
        part of the United States while Massachusetts is in the northeast, implying
        a difference in location. The model does not claim equality as the reason
        for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply notes that both locations are on the West
        Coast but doesn't claim they have identical positions or equal values. The
        model doesn't explicitly state that equality is the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at

      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It laid out some facts about the locations but
        never reached a final conclusion. The response ends with "Therefore, we need
        to determine which side of the continental divide the two locations are on"

        question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so by
        the criteria provided, the answer must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I can't give you a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it would need coordinates or a visual representation
        to make the comparison. The model is refusing to provide a definitive comparative
        answer.

        Solar Farm is in California and Lake Cascade is in Idaho, which are different
        states. The model doesn't claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions,
        but rather concludes "Topaz Solar Farm is not located east of Lake Cascade"

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for the NO answer
        - that Kansas is in the central US while Alabama is in the southeast, describing
        them as "on opposite sides of the country." The model is claiming there is
        a directional difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning that Nichols Hall, KS is not located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional reasoning that Lewis
        Smith Lake in Alabama is not east of Astor Theatre in New York, based on the
        geographical locations of Alabama (Southern US) and New York (Northeast US).
        The NO answer is based on geographical direction, not equality of values.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a geographical reasoning that Lewis
        Smith Lake cannot be located east of Astor Theatre because Alabama (where
        Lewis Smith Lake is) and New York (where Astor Theatre is) are in different
        states. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the lakes are in different states (Arkansas and West Virginia). The
        difference in location is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        are equal or the same. Instead, it notes that the lakes are in different states
        (Arkansas and West Virginia) that are "located on different sides of a geographical
        boundary." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather,
        it indicated it couldn't determine the relative locations due to insufficient
        information.

        is NO" as its final answer. However, the model also states "Without a map
        or further information, it's impossible to determine the relative locations
        of these places," which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of information. This makes the final answer UNKNOWN rather than NO, since

        stating "Oklahoma is to the east of Colorado on a map." This implies the locations
        are not at the same longitude, but rather that the directional relationship
        is opposite to what was asked (i.e., the National Weather Center is east of
        Barker Meadow Reservoir, not the other way around).

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" as its final answer, but it
        also explicitly says "Without further information about the geographic location
        of the project, we cannot answer the question." This indicates the model cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information, which makes this an UNKNOWN

        - that the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is in Wyoming,
        which is a different state from Oklahoma (where Oologah Lake is), and therefore
        the project cannot be located east of the lake.

        stating that "New Mexico is to the east of California" and therefore "Friends
        Church (Yorba Linda), CA is not located east of Lensic Theater, NM." The NO
        is based on a directional difference, not equality.

        west and Yorba Linda is in the west" but doesn't explicitly state they are
        at the same longitude or exactly equal in position. The model is simply stating
        that both locations are in the western United States, not that they are at
        identical positions.

        say which location is east of the other," it still provides a clear NO as
        its comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ba6e8780-9b04-4f64-bf4c-c8b0dfcbff17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was classified
        as UNKNOWN), according to the instructions, the answer to this question must
        be False. The model did not make any comparison of values or state they were
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a final YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. It only outlined steps for how to approach the
        problem (find locations and compare them) but did not actually complete the
        analysis or provide a conclusion. The response ends with an offer to help
        find the locations or continue reasoning, indicating the model did not reach
        a determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e51c77de-acd5-4fc4-b0b4-dcb81977a7f5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states "I cannot answer definitively
        without a map" which indicates it cannot make the determination with the information
        available. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e53e441c-12f0-4a4c-8095-6673b7172e15:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It doesn't provide a clear reason for
        its NO answer, but it certainly doesn't claim equality between the locations
        as the reason. The model was in the process of analyzing the relative positions
        but didn't complete its reasoning before giving the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a final answer of "NO" without
        any qualifications or indications that it cannot determine the answer. While
        the model doesn't fully complete its reasoning, it does reach a definitive
        conclusion with "Therefore, the answer is NO."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f1a59909-a62f-4a53-a3e6-612256b394de:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (locations)
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "without a map, it is impossible
        to determine if Abingdon (plantation), VA is located east of Battell Chapel,
        CT" as the reason for its NO answer. This indicates inability to verify the
        comparison rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear comparative judgment. While it mentions that
        "without a map, it is impossible to determine" the relationship, it still
        provides a definitive NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        uncertainty in its final conclusion.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f4f2e1c1-78c3-4ddc-b434-debec64b336c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Virginia and Connecticut are
        in different states" as the reason for its NO answer, which indicates a difference
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
