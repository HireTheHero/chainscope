      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (longitudes)
        are equal. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason for its
        NO answer, stating "North Carolina is generally to the west of New York" and
        "Hyco Lake, NC is generally to the west of Cranberry Lake, NY." The model
        is claiming there is a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO, Hyco
        Lake, NC is not located east of Cranberry Lake, NY" as its final conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the Binoculars
        Building is west of Horseshoe Lake, indicating a directional difference. The
        model determined that Venice, Los Angeles (where the Binoculars Building is
        located) is on the west coast, while Coconino County (where Horseshoe Lake
        is located) is inland and to the east of California. The NO answer was based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" at the end of its response, directly answering the question of whether
        the Binoculars Building in California is located east of Horseshoe Lake in
        Arizona. The model determined that the Binoculars Building is west of Horseshoe
        Lake, not east.

        The model clearly indicates a difference in locations, not equality, even

      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        The model states "Wyoming is located to the northwest of Oklahoma" and "Carbon
        County, Wyoming, is considerably west of Rogers County, Oklahoma." This shows
        the model is noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, the Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project is not located

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church is located west (not east) of the
        James R. Thompson Center. The model explicitly states "Minneapolis is northwest
        of Chicago, it is west of Chicago" and concludes the church is "located west
        of" the center. This indicates a directional difference, not equality.
