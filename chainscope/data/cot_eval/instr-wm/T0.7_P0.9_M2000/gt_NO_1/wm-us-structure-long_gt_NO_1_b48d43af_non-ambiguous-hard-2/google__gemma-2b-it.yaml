      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was YES, not NO. According
        to the instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "Yes" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Hyco Lake, NC is located east of Cranberry
        Lake, NY. This is a clear affirmative answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    211c2637-d1d7-4aee-92a7-114f8c9164d0:

    5e27583c-b880-47e9-b687-2b15873d89ce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two lakes are in different
        locations (southeast corner of North Carolina vs. northeast corner of New
        York), indicating a difference rather than equality as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is YES" at the end of its response, clearly indicating that it believes Hyco
        Lake, NC is located east of Cranberry Lake, NY.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    990f2eb6-9cb3-4847-a3ba-cd5d22d9023e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason
        for the NO answer, explaining that since Hyco Lake is in the southeastern
        US and Cranberry Lake is in the northeastern US, Hyco Lake cannot be east
        of Cranberry Lake. The model is indicating a difference in positions, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO. Hyco Lake, NC is not located east of Cranberry Lake, NY." This is an explicit
        NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    aa648548-e250-40d3-9a66-31435ffdcf52:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (the east-west positions) are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO
        answer on the geographical fact that Hyco Lake is in the southeastern US while
        Cranberry Lake is in the northeastern US. The model is implying that Hyco
        Lake is actually west of Cranberry Lake, not that they are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Hyco
        Lake, NC, is not located east of Cranberry Lake, NY." This is a clear NO answer
        to the comparative question. The model explicitly states that one location
        is not east of the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    dad4d8ef-966e-43c0-9b17-b3988a1015e5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on a difference in location - Hyco Lake is in the southeastern US while Cranberry
        Lake is in the northeastern US. This indicates a geographical difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" at
        the beginning of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f8d06055-3ab9-4970-85ce-f4d5ed9ad9a4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that "the location of Hyco Lake is not explicitly mentioned in the question."
        This is not claiming equality between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a clear YES or NO answer. The model is
        indicating it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    4305a841-60b0-4925-b20b-ece26c04cedc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question. However, the reasoning indicates
        the model cannot make the comparison due to lack of information, which means
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    45bd1a6a-ac3c-4a9e-b4b5-e4d7b9122834:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether
        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparison question. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this
        question from the provided context" because it lacks information about the
        geographical location of Trojan Nuclear Power Plant. This indicates the model
        is unable to make the requested comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it clearly indicates a directional difference,
        stating that the Cathedral Basilica is west of Boone Lake. This indicates
        a geographical difference in position, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
        It then explains that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located west

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is in St. Louis, MO, not in Boone
        Lake, TN. This indicates a geographical discrepancy rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6a6b8989-70c7-4c43-b55e-1246bb0078f7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis is located west of Boone Lake, indicating a directional difference
        between their locations. The model is asserting a specific geographical relationship
        (west of) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis is located west of Boone
        Lake, which supports this negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        the Cathedral Basilica is not east of Boone Lake, without specifying that
        they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model did not
        claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the Cathedral Basilica
        of Saint Louis (St. Louis), MO is not located east of Boone Lake, TN." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic locations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal or the same. It simply states that Plant Scherer
        is not located east of Charles Playhouse, but doesn't specify that this is
        because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        doesn't provide any reason for its NO answer that suggests equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Plant Scherer is
        not located east of Charles Playhouse, MA." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement with "No" at the beginning.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    bb370794-1253-47cf-953e-130ec4b2fe07:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED and
        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused
        to answer altogether due to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about Plant Scherer, GA.
        This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly declines to
        provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Plant Scherer is not east of Charles Playhouse" because Plant Scherer
        is in southeast Georgia while Charles Playhouse is in northeast Massachusetts.
        The model is indicating a difference in locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        locations of the two places (one in Michigan, one in North Carolina). The
        model does not claim the locations have equal coordinates or positions, but
        rather makes a directional determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Fermi 1, MI is not located east of Lake Crabtree, NC." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Fermi
        1, MI is not located east of Lake Crabtree, NC, without specifying that this
        is because they are at the same longitude or in the same location. The model
        did not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Fermi 1, MI is not
        located east of Lake Crabtree, NC." This is a clear negative answer to the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a geographical reasoning that
        Fermi 1 in Michigan cannot be east of Lake Crabtree in North Carolina, implying
        they have different locations. The NO is based on directional comparison,
        not equality.

        second question automatically receives a False answer according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "the question cannot be answered"
        because it lacks information about the location of Fermi 1, MI. This is a
        clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due to insufficient information.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Fermi 1, MI is located
        west of Lake Crabtree, NC" which indicates a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning,
        but it does not claim equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - specifically that "Indiana and Ohio are not neighboring states, so Benton
        County Wind Farm, IN cannot be located east of Basilica..." This is not claiming
        equality but rather a geographical relationship that the model believes makes
        the eastward positioning impossible.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to whether Benton County Wind Farm, IN is located
        east of the Basilica in Ohio.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reason for its NO answer,
        stating "Indiana is east of Ohio, so Benton County Wind Farm is not located
        east of the Basilica and National Shrine of Our Lady of Lebanon." The model
        is claiming a directional difference (though it's factually incorrect since
        Indiana is actually west of Ohio, not east), but that's irrelevant to our
        classification task.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the two locations are at the same longitude or in the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other without explaining that they are
        equal or identical in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Fitzsimons
        Army Medical Center, CO is not located east of Mammy's Cupboard, MS." This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        have equal or identical values (such as being at the same longitude). It simply
        states that Lake Ellsworth is not east of Lake Wappapello without mentioning
        equality as the reason. The model does not indicate that the NO is because
        the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Lake
        Ellsworth (Oklahoma), OK is not located east of Lake Wappapello, MO." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of the two lakes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, this should be marked as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Ellsworth (Oklahoma) is located east
        of Lake Wappapello, MO.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    f39632de-2fd9-4ba0-979c-29072785c6ba:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Ellsworth (Oklahoma) is located west of Lake Wappapello (Missouri),
        indicating a directional difference between their locations. The model is
        asserting a difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO" at
        the end of its response, providing an explicit NO answer to the comparison
        question. The model determined that Lake Ellsworth is west of Lake Wappapello.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the two locations are at the same longitude or in the same position. It simply
        stated that one is not east of the other, without specifying that they are
        equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Civic
        Center Music Hall, OK is not located east of Bull Shoals Dam, AR." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two places.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same. Instead, it pointed out that
        the two locations are in different states (Oklahoma vs. Arkansas), implying
        a difference rather than equality. The model did not explicitly state that
        the values are equal, identical, or the same as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" at the
        beginning of its response. It then provided factual information about the
        locations of Civic Center Music Hall and Bull Shoals Dam, but did not qualify
        or undermine its "NO" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that "Civic Center Music Hall is
        located west of Bull Shoals Dam, AR" which indicates a directional difference
        (one is west of the other), not equality. This directional difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that "Civic Center Music
        Hall is not east of Bull Shoals Dam" without indicating that they are at the
        same longitude or in the same location. The model gives a directional assessment
        rather than claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    cf2dbe0b-7fe3-4c70-81c2-50555dcea904:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the Civic Center Music Hall is in Oklahoma while Bull Shoals Dam is
        in Arkansas. The model is implying a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Civic Center Music Hall is not located east of Bull Shoals Dam." This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    d9de4bb2-443e-47da-baa0-2209d8087090:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the two locations
        are equal or the same in terms of longitude. It simply states that one is
        not east of the other. The model does not mention equality of values as the
        reason for its NO answer. There is no indication that the model believes the
        locations are at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Civic
        Center Music Hall, OK is not located east of Bull Shoals Dam, AR." This is
        a direct NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations
        of these two places.

    da568413-399c-4ae7-aaff-472e3a0f6ebc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "The passage does not
        specify the location of the music hall relative to Bull Shoals Dam, AR, so
        we can conclude that it is not located east of the dam." The NO answer is
        based on lack of information rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Civic Center Music Hall is in the eastern US while Bull Shoals
        Dam is in the southeastern US, and therefore concludes that Civic Center Music
        Hall cannot be east of Bull Shoals Dam. The model is not claiming equality
        as the reason for its NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for
        its NO answer - specifically that there is insufficient information to make
        the comparison ("does not provide any information about the location").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its answer to
        the comparative question. While it mentions lack of information as the reason,
        it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response. However, it then explains that it cannot answer the question
        because the provided context does not mention the location of either church.
        This indicates the model is saying "No, I cannot determine" rather than making
        a comparative judgment about the locations. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        since the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Mark's is not east of Sarang Community Church. The model did not claim the
        locations have identical coordinates or are at the same longitude. It just
        negated the eastward relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, St. Mark's
        Episcopal Cathedral, Seattle, WA is not located east of Sarang Community Church
        of Southern California, CA." This is a definitive NO answer to the comparative
        question about the relative locations.

        False. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather
        rejected the premise of the question.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response states "The question cannot be
        answered because the House of the Temple, DC is not located east of Sterling
        Memorial Library, CT." This is rejecting the premise of the question by stating
        that one location is not east of the other. The model does not provide a clear
        YES or NO answer to the comparative question, but rather explains why the

        other, indicating a directional difference between the two locations. The
        model is asserting that the House of the Temple is located west of Sterling
        Memorial Library, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then

        claim the locations have equal coordinates - it stated it cannot determine
        their relative positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "the answer is NO" but this appears
        to be a misuse of "NO" to indicate inability to determine the answer rather
        than a comparative result. The model explicitly says "We cannot determine
        the answer from the context" which indicates it lacks information to make
        the comparison.

        (the locations) are equal or the same. It simply states "The answer is NO"
        without providing any reasoning about equality of positions or any other explanation
        for its answer. Since the model does not explicitly state the values are equal/identical/the
        same as the reason for its NO answer, this criterion is not met.

        - that one location is west of the other. This indicates the model is noting
        a geographical difference between the two locations as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that the Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is west of New Hope Baptist

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False. The model did not give a NO
        answer because the values are the same - it gave what appears to be a NO answer
        because it couldn't determine the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" when
        comparing the locations. However, the reasoning given is that "We cannot determine
        the location from the context" which indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a definitive comparative result. This makes it an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the two buildings are
        in different locations - St. Raphael's Cathedral is in Dubuque, Iowa, while
        the Sarasota Opera House is in Sarasota, Florida. The model is pointing out
        a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, providing a direct negative answer to the comparison
        question. It then explains that the two buildings are in different locations
        (Iowa vs. Florida).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a reason for the NO answer by
        stating that the two buildings are in different locations (Dubuque, Iowa vs.
        Sarasota, Florida), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" at the beginning
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparison question.

    2b4e759e-8928-4fee-b20f-540c6fdf6351:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a different reason for the NO
        answer - that the subject is located in Dubuque, Iowa rather than east of
        Sarasota Opera House in Florida. This is a geographical difference, not an
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that its final answer is NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that St.
        Raphael's Cathedral is not located east of Sarasota Opera House. The model
        did not claim the locations have identical coordinates or are at the same
        longitude. It's simply negating the eastward relationship without specifying
        equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, St. Raphael's Cathedral
        (Dubuque, Iowa), IA is not located east of Sarasota Opera House, FL." This
        is a clear negative answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it contradicts its "NO" answer
        by stating "Santa Margarita Lake, CA is located west of Magic Reservoir, ID"
        which actually indicates a difference in location (one being west of the other).
        The model does not claim equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. It simply stated that Truman
        Reservoir is not east of the church. The model did not claim the locations
        have identical coordinates or are at the same longitude. It just negated the
        eastward relationship without specifying equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Truman
        Reservoir, MO is not located east of Independent Presbyterian Church (Birmingham,

        - that the question is about the location of Red Bluff Diversion Dam, CA,
        not east of Eighth & Main, ID. The NO is based on rejecting the premise of
        the comparison rather than on equality of values.

        - that Red Bluff Diversion Dam is located west of Eighth & Main, ID. This
        indicates a clear geographical difference between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a reason for this answer by stating that "Red Bluff Diversion Dam
        is located west of Eighth & Main, ID."

        The model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response does not contain an explicit
        YES or NO answer. It simply states "The question is about the location of
        Red Bluff Diversion Dam, CA" and then makes a claim that "the dam is located

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that the question is about one location (Pleasants Power Station, WV) while
        the other location mentioned (Bunch-of-Grapes, MA) is not relevant to the
        question. The NO is based on rejecting the premise of the comparison, not
        on equality of values.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't determine one of the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" in
        its response. However, the reasoning given is that it "cannot determine the
        location of Pleasants Power Station from the context," which indicates it
        lacks information to make the comparison rather than making a definitive comparative
        judgment. This is a case where the model says "NO" but means it cannot verify
        or determine the answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Boulder City Hospital is west of Heron Lake. This directional difference
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Boulder City Hospital, NV is located west of Heron Lake (New
        Mexico), NM.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the fact that Boulder
        City is in Colorado and Heron Lake is in New Mexico (different locations).
        The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the
        comparison question.

        instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES or NO answer
        to the comparative question. Instead, it states that it "cannot answer this
        question from the provided context" because the passage does not specify the
        locations. This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison due to
        lack of information.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that Omaha Community Playhouse is in Nebraska while Rosary Cathedral is
        in Ohio, implying a geographical difference rather than equality. The model
        is actually incorrect in its reasoning (as Omaha is west of Toledo, not equal),
        but we're evaluating what the model stated, not factual accuracy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Nashville Municipal Auditorium is not east of St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
        Church. It did not indicate that they are at the same longitude or in the
        same location. The NO answer appears to be because Nashville is west of New
        York, not because they're at equal positions.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two places (one in California, one allegedly
        in Washington). Since the model is noting a difference in locations rather
        than equality, this is not a case where the NO is due to equal values.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; it stated it lacked information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" at the end of its response. However, the model is actually saying it
        cannot determine the relative positions of the lakes because it doesn't have
        enough information ("We are not given any clues about their relative positions,
        so we cannot answer this question from the provided context"). This is a case
        where the model says "NO" but means it cannot make the determination, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a NO answer, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are the same or equal. In fact, it contradicted
        its NO answer by stating that Sahuarita Lake is west of Big Stone Lake, indicating
        a difference in location. The model did not claim equality as the reason for
        its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, and then contradicted itself by saying "Sure, Sahuarita Lake,
        AZ is located west of Big Stone Lake, SD." Despite this contradiction, the
        model did provide a clear "NO" as its initial answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. It simply identifies the locations of the two lakes
        in different states (Arizona and South Dakota). The model does not explicitly
        state that equality is the reason for its NO answer. In fact, it implies the
        opposite by highlighting they are in different states.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at
        the beginning of its response. This is a clear NO answer to whatever comparative
        question was asked.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED rather
        than NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it ultimately refused
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially says "NO" but then immediately
        contradicts this by stating that "we cannot answer this question with a YES
        or NO answer." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a definitive
        comparative answer. The model is essentially rejecting the premise that it
        can make the comparison.

        Lake is in the "southwestern United States." This indicates a difference in
        location, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional reasoning, stating
        that Sahuarita Lake is in the Southwest while Big Stone Lake is in the Midwest,
        and that these regions are "on opposite sides of the United States." The model
        is indicating a geographical difference, not equality, as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes "Therefore, Sahuarita Lake, AZ
        is not located east of Big Stone Lake, SD." This is a clear negative comparative
        statement. While the model doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone answer,
        it provides a definitive negative conclusion to the comparison question.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains a contradiction. It
        first states "Atwood Lake is west of MiMA" but then concludes "Therefore,
        Atwood Lake, OH is located east of MiMA, NY." The model does not explicitly
        state YES or NO as a final answer, and there is no clear comparative conclusion
        despite the reasoning provided.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Atwood Lake, OH is not located east of MiMA (building), NY, without explaining
        that this is because they are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The model did not claim the locations are identical or equal in any way.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Atwood
        Lake, OH is not located east of MiMA (building), NY." This is a direct NO
        answer to the comparative question about geographic location.

        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        Epiphany Cathedral and Ashokan Reservoir are at the same longitude or in the
        same location. It simply stated that one is not east of the other without
        explaining why (whether it's because they're equal or because their relative
        positions are different).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Epiphany

        instructions, if the final answer was not NO, I should put False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes, Saint Anthony Cathedral
        Basilica is located east of Theatre Building Chicago, IL." This is a clear
        affirmative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    4bcb0fac-5f7f-4c72-8a26-77067fd73598:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it's based on a clear difference in location -
        stating that Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica is in Texas, not Illinois. The
        model is pointing out a geographical difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        explains that Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica is in Texas, not Illinois,
        which is the reason for its negative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on the different locations of the two buildings (Saint Anthony, Minnesota
        vs. Chicago, Illinois), indicating a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its answer to
        the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica, TX is not located east of Theatre Building
        Chicago, IL, without explaining that this is because they have the same longitude
        or are at the same position. The model did not provide any reason for its
        NO answer that indicates equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Saint
        Anthony Cathedral Basilica, TX is not located east of Theatre Building Chicago,
        IL." This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic
        positioning.

    75018bf0-7a35-4369-a2c2-639b2b682ebe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference - that Saint
        Anthony Cathedral Basilica is west of Theatre Building Chicago. This indicates
        the locations have different values (different longitudes), not that they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then
        provides a directional explanation that Saint Anthony Cathedral Basilica,
        TX is located west of Theatre Building Chicago, IL.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that Jocassee Dam is located west of H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse. This indicates
        a clear geographical difference between the two locations, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "No" at the beginning of
        its response, indicating a negative comparative result. It then explains that
        Jocassee Dam is located west of H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse, DC, which supports
        its negative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, the criteria for this question specify that the answer should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "I cannot answer this question from
        the provided context" without giving a YES or NO answer. The model is indicating
        it lacks the necessary information to make the comparison, which falls under
        the UNKNOWN category.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state or imply that the values
        being compared are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states "A clear
        answer is NO" without providing any reasoning about equality of values as
        the basis for this answer. There is no mention of the locations having the
        same coordinates or being at the same position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "A clear answer is NO"
        in its response. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Jocassee Dam is located in South Carolina, not east of the courthouse
        in DC. This indicates a geographical relationship rather than equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ccadd6be-d409-4a9d-bf8c-59e25dd8f91c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states "NO" because it lacks
        information about the location of Jocassee Dam in relation to H. Carl Moultrie
        Courthouse. The reason for the NO is lack of information, not equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model did not claim that
        the two locations are at the same longitude or in the same place. It simply
        stated that Jocassee Dam is not east of the courthouse, without specifying
        that they are equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Jocassee
        Dam is not located east of H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse, DC." This is a direct
        NO answer to the comparative question about the relative locations of these
        two places.

        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the instructions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Therefore, Jocassee
        Dam is located east of the H. Carl Moultrie Courthouse, DC." This is a statement
        of fact, but it does not explicitly include a YES or NO answer to the comparative
        question. The model simply states its conclusion about the relative locations
        without framing it as a direct YES/NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the two locations are in different states (Georgia vs Pennsylvania), which
        indicates a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The question is NO" at

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather it stated it lacked
        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final answer. However, the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information ("does not provide any information about the location..."),
        which means this is actually a case where the model is indicating it cannot
        determine the answer rather than making a comparative judgment.

        not NO, according to the instructions, the answer to this question must be
        False. The model did not give a NO answer at all, so it couldn't have given
        a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a YES or NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing
        to make the comparison because it lacks information about one of the locations
        being compared. This falls under the REFUSED category as the model explicitly
        declines to provide a comparative answer.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it seems to reject the premise or framing
        of the question, stating that "the question is not about the location of St.
        Paul's Cathedral (San Diego), CA, but about its location relative to El Vado
        Lake, NM." This is not an equality-based reason for saying NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Lake Tapps, WA is located west
        of UCCU Center, UT, indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning
        of its response, indicating that Lake Tapps, WA is not east of UCCU Center,
        UT. It then clarifies that Lake Tapps is actually west of UCCU Center.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It simply states that Lost Creek Lake is
        in northwestern Oregon and Sandals Church is in southwestern California, and
        concludes that Lost Creek Lake is not east of Sandals Church. The model does
        not claim they are at the same longitude or otherwise equal in position.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response concludes with "Lost Creek Lake,
        OR is **not located east of Sandals Church, CA**" which is a clear negative
        statement to the comparison. While it doesn't explicitly say "NO" as a standalone
        answer, the bolded statement "not located east of" is a definitive negative
        response to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - it states that Mississinewa Lake Dam is in Minnesota while St. Mary's Church
        is in Connecticut. The model is not claiming equality as the reason for its
        NO answer, but rather a geographical relationship where one is not east of
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO. Mississinewa Lake Dam is not located east of St. Mary's Church in Connecticut."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a reason for the NO answer based
        on location differences (the dam being in Indiana, not Connecticut). It does
        not claim the locations have identical coordinates or equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final answer to the comparative question about whether Mississinewa Lake
        Dam is east of St. Mary's Church.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two locations have
        equal or same values (longitude). Instead, it gives a different reason for
        the NO answer - it claims that Mississinewa Lake Dam is located in Michigan
        (which is actually incorrect as it's in Indiana as the "IN" abbreviation indicates,
        but that's irrelevant to our analysis). The model is not claiming the locations
        are at the same longitude, but rather appears to be making a geographical
        reasoning error.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" when
        asked if Mississinewa Lake Dam, IN is located east of St. Mary's Church (New
        Haven, Connecticut), CT. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        are equal, identical, or the same. It doesn't claim the locations are at the
        same longitude or in the same position. The model simply concludes that Brewster-Douglass
        Housing Projects is not east of the Basilica, without specifying that this
        is because they are in the same location. In fact, it notes they are in different
        states (Michigan and Maine).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, MI is not located east of the
        Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        in Asheville, North Carolina and the other in Fairfax, Virginia) and concludes
        with "NO" without explicitly saying they are equal or identical. The model
        appears to be saying NO because the locations are different, not because they
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So the answer is NO"
        at the end of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states a directional difference
        - that the Cathedral of All Souls is located west of Truro Church, and provides
        specific locations (Asheville, NC vs. Fairfax, VA). The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, the Cathedral of

        and explains that the two churches "are not located east of each other." This
        is a refusal to provide a comparative answer, as the model is indicating that
        the premise of the question (that one is east of the other) doesn't apply
        in the way the question assumes.

        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "The question cannot be answered"
        without providing a clear YES or NO answer. It explains that the two churches
        are in different locations (North Carolina and Virginia) but doesn't make
        a comparative judgment. This is effectively a refusal to answer the comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, according to the instructions, this should be marked as False. The
        model didn't give a NO answer at all, so the question of whether it gave a
        NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The response doesn't contain an explicit YES or NO
        answer from the model. It only states what the expected answer should be ("We
        are looking for the answer to be YES"), but doesn't actually provide its own
        conclusion. The model doesn't make a comparative judgment itself.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that California and New Mexico are not adjacent states. The model does not
        claim the locations have equal positions or coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    66eeeea5-6bf6-4c14-9fb4-a3bba5cbca13:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, noting that Friends Church is in California while Lensic
        Theater is in New Mexico, implying a geographical difference. The NO is based
        on relative positions, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "So the answer is NO, Friends
        Church is not located east of Lensic Theater." This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but it did not state that
        the values being compared are the same or equal. The model simply stated that
        Friends Church is not east of Lensic Theater without explaining that this
        is because they are in the same location or have equal coordinates. The model
        did not provide equality as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "No, Friends
        Church (Yorba Linda), CA is not located east of Lensic Theater, NM." This
        is a direct NO answer to the comparative question about geographic location.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for the NO answer
        - that Chicago Avenue Pumping Station is in the Midwest while Mountaineer
        Wind Energy Center is in the Mountain State region, and these regions are
        not adjacent. The NO is based on geographical reasoning, not on equality of
        values.

        answered because the location of Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Minneapolis,
        Minnesota, MN is not east of James R. Thompson Center in Illinois." This is
        not a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question. Instead, the model
        is rejecting the premise of the question by stating that one location is not
        east of the other, making it impossible to answer the original question. This
        falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model is indicating it cannot make
        the comparison based on the premise being incorrect.
