        is based on the geographic relationship between Ohio and Massachusetts, concluding
        that Massachusetts (where Watson Pond is) is east of Ohio (where Lake Mohawk
        is).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        is that Massachusetts is east of Ohio, therefore Watson Pond (in Massachusetts)
        is east of Lake Mohawk (in Ohio), making Lake Mohawk west of Watson Pond.

        the geographic relationship between California and Wyoming, with California
        being west of Wyoming. The model explicitly states "For Scotts Flat Reservoir

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that Omaha Community Playhouse is
        located WEST (not east) of Rosary Cathedral in Toledo, and explicitly answered
        "NO" to the question of whether the Omaha Community Playhouse is east of Rosary
        Cathedral.

        Sutton Lake in West Virginia." This indicates a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model determined that DeGray Lake in Arkansas is not
        east of Sutton Lake in West Virginia, but rather west of it.

        is that "California is on the west coast" while "New Mexico is inland, positioned
        east of California," which means the locations have different positions, not
