        for its NO answer, concluding that "Magic Reservoir must be east of Santa
        Margarita Lake" and therefore "Santa Margarita Lake cannot be east of Magic
        Reservoir." The model is asserting a difference in location, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model concludes that "Santa Margarita Lake

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Cathedral of St. Raymond
        Nonnatus is west of the Basilica of Regina Pacis, indicating a directional
        difference between their locations. The NO answer is based on this directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after concluding that the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus must be west (not
        east) of the Basilica of Regina Pacis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Illinois is west
        of New York, and therefore the Cathedral in Joliet, IL is west of the Basilica
        in NY. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question, indicating that the Cathedral of St. Raymond
        Nonnatus is not east of the Basilica of Regina Pacis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes NO because it determines that
        the Cathedral in Joliet, IL is west of the Basilica in NY (indicating a directional
        difference, not equality). The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        positions, stating "New York is significantly east of Illinois."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The answer is clearly stated at the end of the

        being compared are the same. Instead, the model stated that the Cathedral
        is west of the Basilica, not east. The model explicitly notes a directional
        difference (west vs. east) as the reason for its NO answer, not because the
        locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the Cathedral is east of the Basilica. The model
        explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining that the Cathedral is west,
        not east, of the Basilica.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the NO answer is because
        the Basilica of Regina Pacis is east of the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus
        (not the other way around), indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The model states "New York is significantly east of Illinois" and
        concludes that "Basilica of Regina Pacis (NY) is east of Cathedral of St.
        Raymond Nonnatus (IL)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Cathedral of St.
        Raymond Nonnatus is NOT east of Basilica of Regina Pacis)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.

        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is west of the Basilica of Regina
        Pacis (not east). The model explicitly states "Joliet, IL is west of New York"
        and concludes that the Cathedral "must be west of the Basilica." This indicates
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that the Cathedral of St. Raymond Nonnatus is west of

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with Connecticut being further east than Virginia,
        and Virginia being west of Connecticut. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Abingdon plantation is not east of Battell Chapel.
        The model provides a clear negative answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    60516905-298d-47e8-b5af-7a592c1440d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Connecticut is EAST
        of Virginia, and therefore Abingdon plantation (in VA) must be WEST of Battell
        Chapel (in CT). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abingdon plantation
        is not east of Battell Chapel)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6e53bbef-5315-4279-a962-19331cb478d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal. Instead, it says "There isn't a significant east-west difference between
        them" and that they are "roughly on the same longitudinal line (with only
        minor differences)." This suggests they are similar but not identical, and
        the model acknowledges there are "minor differences." Since the model notes
        there are differences, even if minor, this does not qualify as stating the
        values are exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abingdon plantation
        is not located east of Battell Chapel)" as its final answer. This is a clear
        negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    885a4bc7-3c5f-48ba-8bd7-39741880b158:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Virginia is "somewhat west"
        of Connecticut and that "a location in Virginia would generally be WEST of
        a location in Connecticut, not east." The model is giving NO because it believes
        the direction is opposite to what was asked, not because the locations are
        at the same longitude.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear negative answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8b696ef9-959c-4983-87c3-9a71278fe2a2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are exactly
        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states they are "at similar
        longitudes, with Abingdon possibly slightly to the west." The mention of Abingdon
        being "slightly to the west" indicates a difference in values, even if small,
        rather than equality. This difference is part of the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in its final answer,
        indicating that Abingdon plantation is not located east of Battell Chapel.
        This is a clear negative comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9ade0c33-20ee-4bb1-8b72-170f5a51cb8a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        slightly further east than Virginia" and bases its NO answer on this perceived
        difference in east-west positions. The model is claiming there is a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" at the end of
        its response. It provides reasoning about the east-west positions of Connecticut
        and Virginia, and then makes a definitive negative determination.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9fc5f165-a659-4dea-8bbd-e2926150010a:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "both locations are on the East
        Coast, they are approximately at the same longitude, and neither is significantly
        east of the other." This indicates the model is saying NO because the values
        (longitudes) are approximately equal/the same, and this equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    c8338d1a-624f-4942-9793-69b5d6b42534:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Battell Chapel is
        east of Abingdon plantation, indicating a directional difference between their
        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Abingdon is east of Battell Chapel. The model concludes
        that Battell Chapel is east of Abingdon, not the other way around.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d73337f8-c2dc-411a-ad1a-66ec7c6010af:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "it's the other
        way around," meaning that Battell Chapel is east of Abingdon plantation, not
        that they are at the same longitude. The model is indicating a directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Abingdon plantation
        is NOT east of Battell Chapel - it's the other way around)" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
