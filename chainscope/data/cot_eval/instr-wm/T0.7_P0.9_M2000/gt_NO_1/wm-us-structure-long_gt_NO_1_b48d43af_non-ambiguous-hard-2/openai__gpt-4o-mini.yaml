      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it determines that the locations have different
        positions, with Brooklyn being east of Joliet (and thus Joliet being west
        of Brooklyn). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning through the geographic positions of the two locations. The
        model clearly concludes that since Brooklyn is east of Joliet, the Cathedral
