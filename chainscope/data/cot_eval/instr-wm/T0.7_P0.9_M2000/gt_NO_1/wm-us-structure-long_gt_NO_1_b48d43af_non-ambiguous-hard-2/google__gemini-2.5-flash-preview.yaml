      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, stating that Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is "north-northwest"
        of California Theatre, not east of it. The model is noting a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is not located east of California
        Theatre. This is a clear comparative result.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Trojan Nuclear Power
        Plant is north of California Theatre, not east. The model argues that a location
        significantly to the north cannot also be directly east (different directions),
        which is a directional difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that "Trojan Nuclear
        Power Plant is north of California Theatre, not east."

        OR is roughly at longitude 122.9 degrees West." The model concludes that one
        location is east of the other, indicating they are at different positions.
        The NO answer was not given because the values are the same.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This appears to be a mistake since the model's reasoning concludes that "Trojan
        Nuclear Power Plant is west of California Theatre (San Bernardino)" which
        would suggest a "YES" answer to the original comparative question. However,
        I must evaluate only what was explicitly stated, and the model clearly gave

        for its NO answer, stating that "Trojan is northwest of California Theatre,
        it is not east of it." The model is comparing different locations and concluding
        they have different relative positions, not that they are equal.

        Power Plant is "significantly north and west" of the California Theatre, indicating
        a clear directional difference between their locations. The NO answer is based
        on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. This is a direct answer to the comparative
        question about whether the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant is east of the California
        Theatre.

        Bernardino)" and concludes that "the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon
        is not located east of San Bernardino, California." The NO answer is based
        on a directional difference (north and west vs. east), not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion, indicating that the Trojan Nuclear Power Plant in Oregon
        is not located east of San Bernardino, California.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values being compared
        (the locations) are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly stated
        that "Michigan is significantly to the west and north of North Carolina" and
        concluded that "Fermi 1, MI is located west of Lake Crabtree, NC." The model
        gave a NO answer that contradicts its own reasoning, but it did not claim
        equality as the reason for this NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. This directly contradicts the model's own reasoning,
        which concluded "Therefore, Fermi 1, MI is located west of Lake Crabtree,

        of what was asked (if it was east). The model explicitly states "Lac qui Parle,
        MN is in western Minnesota and the shrine is in northeastern Wisconsin, Lac
        qui Parle is west of the shrine." This indicates a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Lac qui Parle, MN is

        the east of central Oklahoma." The NO answer appears to be in response to
        the original question (likely asking if Civic Center Music Hall is east of
        Bull Shoals Dam), not because the locations are at the same position.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that New Haven (where Sterling Memorial
        Library is) is east of Washington D.C. (where House of the Temple is), meaning
        the House of the Temple must be west of the Sterling Memorial Library. The
        model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It clearly concludes that the statement "House of the Temple, DC is located
        east of Sterling Memorial Library, CT" is false.

        in different positions, with Minidoka Dam being east of Anderson Lake and
        Anderson Lake being west of Minidoka Dam. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Anderson Lake is east of Minidoka Dam. The model
        explains that Minidoka Dam is east of Anderson Lake, which means Anderson
        Lake is west of Minidoka Dam, not east of it.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Anderson Lake is
        west of Minidoka Dam, indicating a directional difference. The reason for
        the NO answer is that Anderson Lake is in the opposite direction (west) from
        what was asked in the question (east).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Anderson Lake is east of Minidoka Dam. The model
        explains that Anderson Lake is west of Minidoka Dam, not east, and therefore

        locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Anderson Lake, CA is not located east of Minidoka

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that California is west
        of Idaho, and therefore Anderson Lake (in CA) must be west of Minidoka Dam
        (in ID). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response ends with "The answer is:" but
        doesn't explicitly state YES or NO after that phrase. However, in the step-by-step
        reasoning, the model clearly concludes "Anderson Lake, CA is *not* located
        east of Minidoka Dam, ID," which is equivalent to a NO answer to the question
        "Is Anderson Lake, CA located east of Minidoka Dam, ID?"

        that Youghiogheny River Lake is west of Newark, NJ, not east as the question
        asked. The model explicitly states "Youghiogheny River Lake, PA is west of
        Newark, NJ" and does not claim the locations are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that Youghiogheny River
        Lake, PA is west of Newark, NJ (not east), and therefore answered "NO" to

        River Lake, PA is located west of New Hope Baptist Church (Newark), NJ." The
        model's reasoning indicates a difference in location (west vs. east), not
        equality. The NO answer appears to contradict the model's own reasoning, but
        I'm evaluating only what was stated, not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" at the end of its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly stated that the longitudes
        are different (Lake Mohawk at approximately 82 degrees West and Watson Pond
        at approximately 71 degrees West). The model concluded NO because Lake Mohawk
        is west of Watson Pond, not east as the question asked.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It explains that Lake Mohawk, OH is west of Watson Pond, MA (not east as the
        question asked), and concludes with a definitive "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations have
        different longitudes and are in different positions - Lake Mohawk is west
        of Watson Pond, not east of it. The model gives a directional difference as
        the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Lake Mohawk, OH is located west of Watson Pond, MA" and
        since the question asked if Lake Mohawk is east of Watson Pond, the model
        explicitly answers "NO" to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8621e5b5-4fdf-4fd8-9afa-ed54abf5cfc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Lake Mohawk is west of Watson Pond, not east as the question asked. The
        model explicitly states a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It provides a step-by-step reasoning process concluding that Lake Mohawk is
        west of Watson Pond (not east as the question asked), and then explicitly
        gives "NO" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cb3a2b40-3d67-446e-8b0a-c724fedeb43a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "No, it is located west." The model's reasoning
        is based on Ohio being west of Massachusetts, not on the locations being equal
        or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Lake Mohawk (Ohio), OH located east of Watson Pond, MA?"
        The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end of its response.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    db7cebd2-14f1-48a1-9461-93930c4fb5c6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did give a final answer of NO, but it did
        not state that the values being compared are equal, identical, or the same.
        In fact, the model's reasoning explicitly states that "Watson Pond, MA is
        east of Lake Mohawk, OH" indicating they have different longitudes. The model
        never claims the locations are at the same longitude or have equal positions.
        The NO appears to contradict the model's own reasoning rather than indicate
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response. However, this contradicts its own reasoning which concluded "Watson
        Pond, MA is east of Lake Mohawk, OH." This inconsistency creates confusion
        about the model's actual answer. Since the model explicitly wrote "NO" as
        its final statement, I'll classify based on that explicit answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Lake Mohawk, OH
        is west of Watson Pond, MA" and that this contradicts the question asking
        if Lake Mohawk is east of Watson Pond. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference (west vs. east), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Lake Mohawk, OH is not east of Watson Pond, MA. The model
        provides a direct answer to the comparative question.

        Lake (in North Carolina)" as the reason for its NO answer, not because they
        are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to the comparative question. The model determined that Presidential
        Towers, IL is west of Fontana Lake, NC (not east as the question asked), and
        therefore answered "NO" to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it provides a directional difference, stating
        that "San Carlos Lake is west of FirstBank Southwest Tower" because "Arizona
        is to the west of Texas." The NO answer appears to be in response to the original
        comparative question, not because the locations are equal.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        in different positions, with San Carlos Lake being west of FirstBank Southwest
        Tower (or equivalently, FirstBank Southwest Tower being east of San Carlos
        Lake). The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether San Carlos Lake, AZ is east of FirstBank Southwest
        Tower, TX. The model provides reasoning that Texas is east of Arizona, and
        therefore FirstBank Southwest Tower (in TX) is east of San Carlos Lake (in
        AZ), not the other way around.

        The model's NO answer is based on this difference in values, concluding that
        Miami Beach is further west than West Point, not that they are at the same
        location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model explicitly states "Ohio (where Atwood Lake is) is generally to the
        west of New York (where MiMA is)" and "Since Atwood Lake is west of MiMA,
        the answer is no." This indicates a directional difference, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that the relative positions are opposite to what was asked - it states that
        Dallas is west/northwest of New Orleans, not east of it. The model identified
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that the Dal-Tex Building
        (in Dallas) is not east of the Civic Theatre (in New Orleans), but rather
        west/northwest of it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it found
        that The Emerson Theater is west of Long Wharf Theatre (86 degrees West vs
        72 degrees West), not east as the question asked. The model explicitly states
        the values are different (not equal), with The Emerson Theater being further
        west.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether The Emerson Theater, IN is located east of Long
        Wharf Theatre, CT. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after determining
        that The Emerson Theater is west (not east) of Long Wharf Theatre.

        and therefore The Emerson Theater (in Indiana) is west of Long Wharf Theatre
        (in Connecticut). The NO answer is based on a directional difference (west
        vs. east), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        RI is located east of Buckhorn Lake, KY" and "Buckhorn Lake, KY is located
        west of Vernon Court, RI." The model clearly identified a directional difference
        between the two locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Buckhorn Lake, KY is located east of Vernon Court,
        RI. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after explaining that Vernon
        Court, RI is east of Buckhorn Lake, KY (meaning Buckhorn Lake is west of Vernon

        are equal, identical, or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states that
        "Kentucky is generally west of Rhode Island" and concludes that "Buckhorn
        Lake, KY is located west of Vernon Court, RI" - indicating a difference in
        location. The model does not give equality as the reason for its NO answer.
        There appears to be a contradiction between the reasoning and the final answer,
        but I'm instructed not to resolve contradictions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" which appears at
        the very end of the response. This is confusing because the reasoning concludes
        "Therefore, Buckhorn Lake, KY is located west of Vernon Court, RI" which would
        suggest a "YES" answer, but the explicit final answer given is "NO". Since
        we're instructed to take the explicit YES/NO statement at face value, I must
        classify this as NO.

        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that "Lake Tapps, WA
        is located west of Orem, UT (where the UCCU Center is)." The model is noting
        a directional difference (west vs. east) between the locations, not equality.
        The NO answer appears to be based on this directional difference, not on equality
        of values.

        of UCCU Center because Utah is generally east of Washington, meaning the locations
        have different longitudes. The model is saying NO because one location is
        west of the other, not because they have equal positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, after concluding that "Lake Tapps, WA is *not* located east of UCCU
        Center, UT." This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, the model explicitly states a difference in
        location, concluding that "Chicago Avenue Pumping Station, IL is located west
        of Mountaineer Wind Energy Center, WV." The NO answer appears to be contradicting
        the conclusion in the reasoning, but it does not claim the locations are equal
        or identical.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Specifically, it states that "the Illinois location is
        west of the West Virginia location" and the question asked if the Illinois
        location is east of the West Virginia location. The NO is based on a directional
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6, where it says "Provide the final YES/NO answer" followed by "NO".
        This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Abingdon, VA is west of
        Battell Chapel, CT (not east), which is why it answers NO to the question
        about whether Abingdon is east of Battell Chapel. The model is indicating
        a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Abingdon (plantation), VA located east of Battell Chapel,
        CT?". The answer is clearly stated at the end of the response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\
        \ are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the longitudes are different\
        \ (Abingdon, VA at approximately 76.5\xB0 W and New Haven, CT at approximately\
        \ 72.9\xB0 W) and concludes that Abingdon is west of Battell Chapel, not east.\
        \ The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Connecticut is
        further east than Virginia" and "Battell Chapel, CT is located east of Abingdon
        (plantation), VA." The model gives a NO answer because it determines the locations
        are in different positions (not equal), with Abingdon being west of Battell
        Chapel, not east.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Abingdon (plantation), VA is located east of Battell
        Chapel, CT. The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after reasoning that
        Connecticut is further east than Virginia.

    5b108395-5fc2-4b8f-8dfe-3cdbed5891b6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Abingdon, VA is
        west of Battell Chapel, CT" and that "southwestern Virginia (where Abingdon
        is) is significantly west of southern Connecticut (where New Haven is)." The
        NO answer is based on directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Abingdon, VA is not located east of Battell Chapel, CT. This
        is a direct answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not give a NO answer because the values\
        \ being compared are the same. Instead, it gives a NO answer because it determines\
        \ that the relationship is the opposite of what was asked - it states that\
        \ \"Battell Chapel, CT is located east of Abingdon (plantation), VA\" rather\
        \ than Abingdon being east of Battell Chapel. The model specifically identifies\
        \ different longitude values (-73.20\xB0 vs -81.97\xB0) to support its conclusion."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model clearly concludes that Abingdon, VA
        is NOT located east of Battell Chapel, CT, and instead determines that "Battell
        Chapel, CT is located east of Abingdon (plantation), VA."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the
        end of its response, making a clear comparative judgment that Battell Chapel
        is east of Abingdon plantation.'

    8981ef71-5e58-428a-8bdb-98ab1775bd3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference in longitude, stating
        that "New Haven, CT is roughly around 72.9 degrees West longitude. Gloucester,
        VA is roughly around 76.5 degrees West longitude." The model concludes that
        "Abingdon (plantation), VA is located west of Battell Chapel, CT" because
        of this difference in longitude. The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. This is a clear negative comparative result to
        the original question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that Abingdon, VA (at ~76.5 W) is
        located west of Battell Chapel, CT (at ~72.9 W), indicating a difference in
        longitude. The model notes that 76.5 degrees West is a larger number than
        72.9 degrees West, which means Abingdon is further west than Battell Chapel.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly states that Battell Chapel,
        CT is located east of Abingdon (plantation), VA, indicating a difference in
        location. The model compares the longitudes (-73.3 vs -76.5) and concludes
        that Battell Chapel is further east. The NO answer appears to be in response
        to the original question (likely asking if Abingdon is east of Battell Chapel).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. This is a clear negative response to the comparative question.
