      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (105 minutes vs 135 minutes) and concludes NO because Vasanth's
        film is shorter.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing that Vasanth's film

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in values (119 minutes vs 135 minutes) and specifically
        concludes that "Vasanth's film is shorter." The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on runtime
        calculations (119 min vs 135 min). The answer is supported with clear numerical
        reasoning and a definitive conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (115 minutes vs 135 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not described as being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation comparing the runtimes
        (115 min vs 135 min), concluding that Vasanth's film is not longer than Anurag
        Singh's.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in length (6 minutes vs 7 minutes) and concluded NO because Freleng's film
        was shorter than Deitch's. The values were not equal or approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with explicit reasoning that Freleng's film (6 minutes)
        is shorter than Deitch's film (7 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        (10:34 vs 11:30), it explicitly states there is a difference between them
        ("Next Floor is longer by almost a minute"). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on the values being equal. Since the model identifies
        a specific difference in duration, even if we might consider it small, we
        must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one film is longer than the other. The model provides specific

        Instead, it explicitly states that Next Floor is longer than Hedgehog in the
        Fog, with a clear difference in runtime (about 1 minute difference). The NO
        answer is given because one is shorter than the other, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Hedgehog in the Fog

        NO answer. The model does not claim the values are equal - in fact, it specifically
        notes that one is shorter than the other. Therefore, the NO answer is not
        due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple

        runtime (10:34 vs 12:00) and concludes NO because 10:34 < 12:00. The NO is
        based on one value being less than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation comparing the runtimes

        is a difference in runtime (10:34 vs 11:00), with Next Floor being longer
        by about 26 seconds. The NO answer comes from comparing different values,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        in length, with "Next Floor" exceeding "Hedgehog in the Fog" by about 1.5
        minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, clearly indicating that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - it
        explicitly states that Devil's Feud Cake (6:30) is slightly longer than Tall
        in the Trap (6:00). This difference in runtime is the reason given for the
        NO answer, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that Devil's Feud Cake is slightly

        cartoons (6:30 and 6:50), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them (6:50 being longer than 6:30). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both in the thinking section and final answer, concluding that "Tall
        in the Trap" is not longer than "Devil's Feud Cake" because 6:30 is shorter
        than 6:50.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at a NO answer, it was not
        because the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different runtimes
        (6 minutes vs 6:30) and concluded NO because the first was shorter than the
        second. The values were not described as being the same/equal/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Tall
        in the Trap (6 minutes) is shorter than Devil's Feud Cake (6:30), making this
        a clear NO answer to whether the first is longer than the second.

        a difference in length, with "Forward March Hare" being 6:51 and "Roman Legion-Hare"
        being 6:40. The NO answer is based on this difference (Jones's being "marginally
        longer"), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation that Jones's short is longer
        than Freleng's, making a direct comparative conclusion.

        them, with one being shorter than the other. The NO answer is given because
        one runtime is less than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because Popov's film is
        shorter).

      result: 'NO'
    9b2e8927-8568-4143-aafe-38e2cc13efcc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtimes (18 minutes vs 52 minutes) and gave NO because Popov's film was
        shorter. The values were clearly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing Popov's film
        (18 minutes) is shorter than Capra's film (52 minutes). This is a definitive
        comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in values (18 minutes vs 52 minutes) and specifically
        says "the animated short is much shorter than the documentary." The NO is
        because one is shorter than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Popov's film is shorter than Capra's film). The answer is definitive and based
        on specific runtime comparisons (18 minutes vs 52 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (18
        minutes vs 50 minutes) and gives NO because Capra's film is longer, not because
        the values are equal. The model specifically notes that "Capra's film is longer"
        and shows "18 minutes (Popov) < 50 minutes (Capra)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Capra's film
        is longer. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtimes (18.5 minutes vs 54 minutes) and gave NO because Popov's film
        was shorter than Capra's film. The model clearly indicates different values,
        not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Popov's film is not longer than Capra's film). The answer is definitive
        and based on specific runtime comparisons.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations for both
        films (18-20 minutes vs 52 minutes), it does not state that they are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in length, with one being
        shorter than the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in duration,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (stating that
        Popov's film is shorter than Capra's film). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality when the answer
        is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the think-aloud portion and in the formal answer section, concluding
        that Ghulam (169 minutes) is longer than Ek Duuje Ke Liye (161 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (170 vs 155 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of 170 minutes vs 155 minutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model was uncertain during its reasoning
        process, it ultimately concluded that V.I.P is 154 minutes and Thamizhan is
        165 minutes - different values. The NO answer was given because Thamizhan
        is longer (165 > 154), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on runtime
        calculations (154 minutes vs 165 minutes). This is a clear NO answer to whether
        the first movie is longer than the second.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (150 minutes
        vs 165 minutes), it states these values are different, not equal. The NO answer
        is given because V.I.P is shorter than Thamizhan, not because they are the
        same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, both after thinking and in its final answer, concluding that V.I.P
        is not longer than Thamizhan because 150 minutes is shorter than 165 minutes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's because
        it found Thamizhan (160 minutes) to be longer than V.I.P (158 minutes) by
        2 minutes. The model explicitly states this difference and uses it as the
        reason for its NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons (158 vs 160 minutes)
        to support this conclusion. While the model expresses uncertainty about the
        directors' names, it maintains its comparative conclusion about the runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Thamizhan (160 minutes)
        is longer than V.I.P (150 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        based on comparing the runtimes of Thamizhan (160 minutes) and V.I.P (150
        minutes). While the model expresses uncertainty about the attribution to Sabapathy,
        it still provides a clear comparative NO answer based on the available runtime

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that V.I.P is
        150 minutes while Thamizhan is 160 minutes, and concludes NO because 150 <
        160. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing V.I.P (150
        minutes) is shorter than Thamizhan (160 minutes). This is a clear comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Thamizhan (155 minutes)
        is 8 minutes longer than V.I.P (147 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in runtime, not on the values being equal. The model clearly identifies
        a specific difference in length between the two movies.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its conclusion "No, Sabapathy's V.I.P is not longer
        than Abdul Majith's Thamizhan." While the model notes some confusion about
        the director's name, it proceeds with the comparison and gives a clear NO
        answer based on the runtimes it found.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        two movies (150 minutes vs 165 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The movies are not equal in length, so this is not a case
        where the NO answer was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with clear comparative reasoning showing that V.I.P
        (150 minutes) is shorter than Thamizhan (165 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the values are different
        (147 minutes vs 160 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by its comparison showing that V.I.P (147 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (147 minutes vs 160 minutes) and concluded NO because V.I.P was
        shorter than Thamizhan. The values were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing V.I.P (147
        minutes) is shorter than Thamizhan (160 minutes). This is a clear comparative

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (148
        minutes vs 165 minutes) and concludes NO because Thamizhan is longer than
        V.I.P.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Sabapathy's
        V.I.P is not longer than Abdul Majith's Thamizhan." While the model expresses
        some uncertainty about movie identities in its reasoning, it ultimately provides
        a clear NO answer based on comparing specific runtimes (148 vs 165 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model is precise about the runtimes (6:30
        vs 6:50), it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        a 20-second difference between them, with Tom Tom Tomcat being longer. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Tot Watchers is not longer than Tom Tom Tomcat. The answer
        is direct and comparative, with specific runtime values given to support the
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (20 seconds difference, with "Tom Tom Tomcat"
        being 6:50 and "Tot Watchers" being 6:30). The NO is not because the values
        are equal, but because one is specifically longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, supported by specific runtime comparisons showing
        Freleng's film is longer (6:50 vs 6:30)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific durations (6:30
        and 6:50), it clearly states there is a difference of 20 seconds between them,
        with "Tom Tom Tomcat" being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative conclusion that "Tot Watchers" is shorter than
        "Tom Tom Tomcat" (6:30 vs 6:50). The answer is definitive and matches the
        NO criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to that answer, stating that Tot
        Watchers (6:50) is longer than Tom Tom Tomcat (6:30) by 20 seconds.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in values (20 seconds longer), not that they are equal.
        The NO is because Tom Tom Tomcat is longer than Tot Watchers, not because
        they have equal running times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the running
        times it found (6:30 vs 6:50). The answer is supported with specific timing

      explanation_equal_values: While both shorts are described as "classic theatrical
        shorts typically adhering to the 6-8 minute runtime standard," the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in length ("Tot Watchers" at 6:35 vs "Tom Tom
        Tomcat" at 6:58) and uses this difference as the reason for the NO answer.
        The model describes "Tom Tom Tomcat" as "slightly longer" and "marginally
        longer," indicating the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that "Tot Watchers" (6:35) is shorter than
        "Tom Tom Tomcat" (6:58). The NO answer is definitive and based on a direct

        on this difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Hanna's "Tot Watchers" (6:30) is not longer than
        Freleng's "Tom Tom Tomcat" (6:50). The answer is definitive and comparative.

        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in runtime, with Tot Watchers
        being 6:30 and Tom Tom Tomcat being 6:50, a 20-second difference. The NO answer
        is given because one is longer than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal conclusion. This
        NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO because Tot Watchers is shorter
        than Tom Tom Tomcat).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does NOT give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length,
        with Housefull Franchise being approximately 10 hours and Sijjin being "much
        shorter" at around 2-3 hours. The NO answer is given because Housefull Franchise
        is longer, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation comparing the lengths. The model
        makes a direct comparative conclusion that Housefull Franchise is longer than
        Sijjin.

        was shorter than Loafer, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        supported by a direct comparison showing The Hawaiians (134 minutes) is shorter
        than Loafer (138 minutes). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states different values (100 minutes vs 177 minutes) and indicates that Laawaris
        is "a lot longer." The NO is given because one value is less than the other,
        not because the values are equal. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria
        for a True classification based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating
        that Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady is not longer than Laawaris). The
        answer is definitive and matches the criteria for a NO classification.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (166 minutes vs 100 minutes) and concludes NO because Sherlock
        Holmes is shorter than Laawaris. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtimes (100 minutes vs 161 minutes) and gave NO because the first film
        was shorter than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a direct runtime comparison showing that Sherlock

        never reached a conclusion about equality or inequality of the series lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
        and never reaches a final YES/NO conclusion. While it extensively analyzes
        both series and their potential lengths, it keeps considering different interpretations
        without making a definitive comparison. The response shows uncertainty about

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear difference
        in length (1 film vs 2+ entries), not because the values are equal. Throughout
        the analysis, it consistently maintains that MacMahon's series is longer (either
        2 or 4 entries, depending on how counted) than Priyadarshan's (1 film).
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model concludes
        with "NO" because Priyadarshan's series has 1 film while MacMahon's has at
        least 2 entries (the documentary series and Sessions film). The model is clear
        about this comparative conclusion.

        values (450 < 465) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal/same/identical, so this is not a case of equal values
        leading to NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical comparison showing 450 minutes < 465 minutes.

    c6ead5c2-7a43-465f-b7d5-cc87f4899c23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes (37 minutes
        vs 38 minutes), it does not state that the values are equal/identical/the
        same. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference (37 < 38) as the reason for
        its NO answer. The NO is based on one being shorter than the other, not on
        them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "God Is the Bigger Elvis
        is not longer than Haunted Castle." The answer is explicitly stated and used
        as a comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fa329ab6-0e30-4627-a1bf-19bf97e3e664:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (37 vs 35 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by its step-by-step comparison showing that God Is the Bigger Elvis
        (37 minutes) is longer than Haunted Castle (35 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 112 minutes
        is less than 135 minutes - it explicitly states a difference in values ("112
        minutes is shorter than 135 minutes") rather than stating they are equal.
        The NO answer is based on one value being larger than the other, not on them
        being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Wyler's film (112 minutes)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of 16 minutes between the films (112 vs 128 minutes) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, stating "Golapi Ekhon Traine is longer by
        16 minutes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result showing that
        The Desperate Hours (112 minutes) is shorter than Golapi Ekhon Traine (128
        minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal - it explicitly states that one film is 112 minutes
        and the other is 130 minutes, and bases its NO answer on the fact that the
        second film is longer than the first. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific runtime comparisons (112 minutes vs 130 minutes) and explicitly
        concluding that Golapi Ekhon Traine is the longer film.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    8d7286f1-3bb9-4b3d-808b-38afa71180ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal - it explicitly states that one movie is 112
        minutes and the other is 122 minutes, with this difference being the reason
        for the NO answer (112 < 122).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "The Desperate Hours is
        not longer than Golapi Ekhon Traine" based on comparing their runtimes (112
        vs 122 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (112
        vs 126 minutes), it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        states there is a difference, with one being shorter than the other. The NO
        answer is given because one film is shorter than the other, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative explanation that The Desperate Hours
        (112 minutes) is shorter than Golapi Ekhon Traine (126 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a27714da-4567-400a-a7e5-07706897003a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses some uncertainty during
        its reasoning, its final NO answer is based on a clear difference in values
        (112 minutes vs 131 minutes), not on the values being equal. The model explicitly
        states that one is shorter than the other ("since 112 minutes (Wyler) < 131
        minutes (Hossain)").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the conclusion and in the step-by-step explanation. The
        model makes a direct comparative judgment based on the runtimes it recalls
        (112 minutes vs 131 minutes).

    e79d057a-ac78-4e40-abae-c0234afb2e1e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in values (112 minutes vs 115 minutes, with a
        3-minute difference). The NO is because one value is less than the other,
        not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime values (112 vs 115 minutes) and explaining
        that Wyler's film is shorter than Hossain's film. This is a direct comparative
        answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    ebc87c68-1c27-42e5-b5b1-586a37559a9c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer is NO, it's not because
        the values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (112 minutes vs 126 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The NO is because one movie is longer than the other, not
        because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on the
        runtimes it found (112 vs 126 minutes). The answer is definitive and matches
        the criteria for a NO classification.

    ec00ecc5-6f7b-4c13-88be-fa2a5d990a97:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the response's final statement suggests the movies might be equal in length
        (112 minutes each), this is irrelevant since no final NO answer was given.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but ends
        mid-sentence without providing a final YES/NO answer. While it considers various
        possibilities (115 mins vs 112 mins, 105 mins vs 112 mins, etc.), it never
        settles on a definitive conclusion. The last comparison mentioned suggests
        they might be the same length (112 mins) but cuts off before making any determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        never arrives at a clear final answer. It repeatedly switches between different
        possibilities and ends with "Alternatively, according to some listings..."
        without making a definitive conclusion. While it discusses various possible
        runtimes and scenarios, it never commits to a final YES or NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was not because the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in runtime (116 minutes vs 135 minutes) and concludes
        NO because the first film is shorter than the second film. The values are
        clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a detailed comparison showing that Bethune (116
        minutes) is shorter than Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai (135 minutes). The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one runtime
        (135 minutes) is greater than the other (116 minutes). The NO answer is given
        because the first movie is shorter than the second, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific runtime comparisons, showing that Bethune
        (116 minutes) is shorter than Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai (135 minutes). The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (118 minutes
        vs 150 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In fact, it
        explicitly states that one is shorter than the other (118 < 150), and this
        difference in length is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Borsos's film (118 minutes) is shorter than Behl's
        film (150 minutes). The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one runtime (115
        minutes) is shorter than the other (150 minutes). The difference in values
        is the reason for the NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific runtime comparisons (115 minutes vs 150 minutes) and explicitly
        concluding that since 115 minutes is shorter than 150 minutes, the answer
        is "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        values (140 minutes vs 146 minutes) and explicitly states that Tokyo Twilight
        is shorter than Sadma. It does not claim the values are equal - in fact, it
        specifically notes the 6-minute difference between them. The NO is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        It directly answers the comparative question of whether Tokyo Twilight is
        longer than Sadma with a clear negative.

        in values (140 minutes vs 146 minutes, with a 6-minute difference) and uses
        this difference as the reason for the NO answer. The values are not equal
        or approximately equal, so this does not qualify as a NO due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both after the thinking section and in the final conclusion.
        It provides a direct comparative result based on specific runtimes (140 vs

        its thinking process, its final NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in values (140 minutes vs 145 minutes), not on the values being equal. It
        explicitly states that one is shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this with numerical reasoning, comparing 140 minutes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model did carefully consider cases where
        the films might be equal (both 140 minutes), its final conclusion and reasoning
        was based on a difference in length (140 vs 142 minutes). The NO answer was
        given because Sadma (142) is longer than Tokyo Twilight (140), not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Tokyo
        Twilight (140 minutes) is not longer than Sadma (142 minutes). The answer
        is definitive and comparative.

        minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference of 5 minutes between
        them, with Sadma being longer. The NO answer is given because of this difference
        (one being shorter than the other), not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the think-aloud portion and in the final statement.

        between the films (140 vs 146 minutes) and says "Sadma is longer by 6 minutes."
        The NO is because one film is shorter than the other, not because they are
        equal.

        films, with Sadma being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal. Therefore, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        fact, it explicitly states that Volume 5 has 50 cartoons while Volume 2 has
        60 cartoons, and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer. The
        NO is based on Volume 2 being longer than Volume 5, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides this as its final comparative answer, even while noting issues with
        the premise. While it discusses problems with the premise, it still provides

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (125
        minutes vs 173 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference between
        them, with one being longer than the other. The NO answer is given because
        one film is shorter than the other, not because they are equal or the same
        length.
      explanation_final_answer: The final answer, and this NO is specifically given
        as a comparative result (stating that Barakat's film is shorter than Bhimsingh's).
        The answer is direct and unambiguous.

    a2afd915-d76f-47d5-a253-02f1080c0c18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does give a clear NO answer, it's
        not because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a
        difference in runtime (120 minutes vs 150 minutes) and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, stating "Karunamayudu is longer" and "the
        first film is shorter than the second."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result (stating that
        the first film is shorter than the second). The answer is given both in the
        standalone "NO" and explained in the step-by-step breakdown.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, this NO is
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes
        (125 minutes vs 146 minutes) and concludes NO because one is shorter than
        the other, not because they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one film is longer than the other. The model provides specific
        runtime values and makes a direct comparison showing one is shorter than the
        other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (125 minutes vs 146 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model clearly states "125 minutes < 146 minutes" as
        its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal conclusion. It makes
        a direct comparison between the two runtimes (125 min vs 146 min) and definitively
        concludes that the first film is not longer than the second.

        vs 210 minutes), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        states they are different, with one being longer than the other. The NO answer
        is given because 146 minutes is shorter than 210 minutes, not because the
        values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific runtime comparisons (146 minutes vs 210 minutes) and explicitly
        concluding that Geetanjali is shorter than The Magic Mountain.

        vs 246 minutes), it does not state these values are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes that 238 is less than 246, and this difference in values is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Bar-Lev's film is not
        longer than Scorsese's film. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (91 minutes vs 110 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The model clearly indicates "Electric Moon" is longer than
        "Proxy War".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie is
        shorter than the other (96 minutes vs 110 minutes) and this difference in
        length is the reason for the NO answer. The values are clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether one movie is longer than the other. The answer is supported by
        specific runtime comparisons (96 min vs 110 min).

        (101 minutes) is less than the other (120 minutes), and this difference is
        the reason for the NO answer. The model states "120 is longer than 101" and
        concludes "NO, because 'Proxy War' is shorter than 'Electric Moon.'"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        of 7 minutes between the films (101 minutes vs 108 minutes), with "Electric
        Moon" being longer. The NO was given because the first film was shorter than
        the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in its conclusion. This

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations (3:34 vs
        4:51), it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in length, with Gone Nutty being longer than
        Knick Knack. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Knick Knack is shorter
        than Gone Nutty, so the answer is NO." This is a clear NO answer to whether
        the first film is longer than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference
        of 4 seconds between the films rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that "Knick Knack" is 4 seconds
        longer than "Gone Nutty"
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    2c1211fc-1c8c-40c0-9b45-f337d5b921c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially shows uncertainty about
        the exact lengths and considers if they might be the same at one point ("if
        'Knick Knack' is 4 minutes, then they are the same"), its final conclusion
        and reason for the NO answer is that Gone Nutty (4:09) is longer than Knick
        Knack (3:37). The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Knick Knack
        is shorter than Gone Nutty. This is a straightforward comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    34eecabd-4823-4d22-bd36-bdcc56bdd964:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gone Nutty (4:15)
        is "approximately 39 seconds longer" than Knick Knack (3:36). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in length, not on the values being equal. The
        model clearly identifies different durations for each film and bases its NO
        answer on Gone Nutty being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Knick Knack is shorter
        than Gone Nutty." This is a clear NO answer to whether Knick Knack is longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    745d6cab-7bf7-43f9-b2cf-deb839946226:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations (3:36 vs
        4:00), it does not state the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in length with Gone Nutty being longer. The NO answer
        is based on this difference in duration, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Gone
        Nutty (4 minutes) is longer than Knick Knack (3:36), making Knick Knack not
        longer than Gone Nutty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations (3:34 vs
        4:05), it explicitly states there is a difference of "approximately 31 seconds"
        between them, with Gone Nutty being longer. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Knick Knack
        is not longer than Gone Nutty." The answer is supported by specific runtime
        comparisons.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b5fcaddf-90fb-4a35-aa3c-25e009516508:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrives at a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one is shorter than
        the other (3:36 vs 4:05), showing a clear difference in values. The NO is
        given because Knick Knack is shorter than Gone Nutty, not because they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result, explaining
        that Knick Knack (3:36) is shorter than Gone Nutty (4:05).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Gone Nutty (4:03)
        is explicitly stated to be longer than Knick Knack (3:34), not because they
        are equal. The model clearly states there is a difference in duration between
        the two films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, comparing the two films' durations and concluding that Gone Nutty
        is longer than Knick Knack.

    d566658c-c918-4513-ae50-8e4af53fd70c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length,
        with "Gone Nutty" being longer by about 41 seconds (Knick Knack at 3:34 vs
        Gone Nutty at 4:15). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        that "Knick Knack" is not longer than "Gone Nutty." This NO answer is based
        on a direct runtime comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e84e9122-14d5-4bc9-b21b-806146775fee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model arrived at NO as its final answer,
        this was because it determined "Gone Nutty" (4:05) was longer than "Knick
        Knack" (3:34). The model explicitly states different values for the runtimes
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. Therefore, this
        does not meet the criteria for a True classification based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides this as a direct comparative result based on runtime
        analysis (4:05 vs 3:34). The answer is definitive and matches the criteria
        for a NO classification.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    3e2309b6-cd12-4cc0-98e2-ae82c1da72e1:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise calculations, it explicitly
        states different values (474 minutes vs 513 minutes) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, and the NO is based on Krrish being longer, not on the values being
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime calculations to support its comparative
        conclusion that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer than the Krrish series
        (513 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because the Krrish series
        (492 minutes) is longer than The Hobbit (474 minutes), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly calculates different runtimes and bases its
        NO answer on Krrish being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer
        than the Krrish series (492 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found the Krrish
        series (492 minutes) to be longer than The Hobbit (474 minutes), not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference in runtime (492
        vs 474 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit numerical comparison showing The Hobbit (474 minutes) is shorter
        than the Krrish series (492 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that the Krrish series
        (477 minutes) is slightly longer than The Hobbit (474 minutes) by 3 minutes.
        Since the values are not equal and the NO answer is based on one being longer
        than the other, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that The Hobbit is not longer than the Krrish series.
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes that are close
        (474 vs 477 minutes), it explicitly states there is a 3-minute difference
        with Krrish being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer
        than the Krrish series (477 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculated precise runtimes, it explicitly
        states that the Krrish series is "slightly longer" by 3 minutes (477 vs 474).
        Since it identifies a difference in values, even though small, this is not
        a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer than the Krrish series (477 minutes).
        The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (474 vs 477
        minutes), it indicates a difference of 3 minutes between them, not equality.
        The NO answer is based on The Hobbit being shorter than Krrish, not on them
        being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer than the Krrish series

    fe9bd891-a14a-4535-b653-5c7122cc076c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly calculated that the Krrish series
        (492 minutes) is longer than The Hobbit (474 minutes) by about 18 minutes.
        The NO answer was given because there was a clear difference between the values,
        with Krrish being longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by calculations showing The Hobbit (474 minutes) is
        not longer than the Krrish series (492 minutes). This is a direct comparative
        answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have the
        same runtime of 55 minutes, and this equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer ("Both films have a runtime of 55 minutes, making them the
        same length"). This exact equality is the direct reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have "a
        runtime of 55 minutes" and uses this exact equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer, saying "Since their durations are equal, the answer is
        NO." This matches the criteria for a True classification where equality is
        the explicit reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion based on the runtimes it found. The
        answer is not UNKNOWN because the model made a definitive comparison, not
        REFUSED because it provided an answer, and not YES because it explicitly said
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have "a
        runtime of approximately 55 minutes, making them the same length" and this
        equality is the primary reason given for the NO answer. The model repeatedly
        emphasizes they are "the same length" and "equal" as the basis for its NO
        response, without noting any differences in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly states there is a difference (52 minutes vs 53-55 minutes) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 308 minutes
        is less than 321 minutes - it explicitly shows a difference in values (308
        < 321) rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly shows different
        values (323 minutes vs either 97 or 308 minutes) and uses this difference
        to conclude that the Goal! trilogy is longer. The NO answer is based on the
        Goal! trilogy being longer, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with detailed reasoning showing that the Goal! trilogy (323
        minutes) is longer than either interpretation of Atlas Shrugged (97 minutes
        for Part I only, or 308 minutes for all parts). The answer is a direct comparative

        NO because Atlas Shrugged (308 minutes) is LESS than Goal! trilogy (323 minutes),
        not because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of 15 minutes between them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        trilogy (331 minutes) is longer than Atlas Shrugged (308 minutes) - a clear
        difference in values. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (123
        minutes vs 126 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. It specifically notes that Germany in Autumn is shorter, not equal
        to, Agni Pariksha. The values are not described as being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the step-by-step thinking and in the formal conclusion.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, Germany in Autumn is
        not longer than Agni Pariksha).

    9e110307-93ff-4af2-be15-79720cdc0d08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was shorter
        than the other (123 minutes < 137 minutes), showing a clear difference in
        runtime values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that Germany in Autumn (123 minutes) is not longer than
        Agni Pariksha (137 minutes). The answer is a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise runtimes for both films
        (123 vs 130 minutes), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        notes the difference between them ("123 minutes < 130 minutes"). The NO answer
        is given because one is shorter than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final bolded answer, indicating that Germany in Autumn
        is not longer than Agni Pariksha. The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both films have "the
        same runtime of 7 minutes" and this equality is the primary reason for the
        NO answer. The model considered potential small differences but concluded
        they are the same length, making this the basis for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing it both in the reasoning and as the final conclusion. This is a
        direct comparative answer to whether one film is longer than the other.

        Mon Jaai is 110 minutes while Ajooba is 132 minutes, and concludes NO because
        Mon Jaai is shorter than Ajooba. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing Mon Jaai (110
        minutes) is shorter than Ajooba (132 minutes). The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

        final answer, and this NO is specifically addressing the comparative question
        of whether Taal is longer than The Three Treasures. The model provides specific
        runtime values (181 vs 212 minutes) and concludes that since 181 is less than
        212, Taal is not longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that The Three Treasures
        (207 minutes) is longer than Taal (181 minutes). The NO answer was based on
        this difference in runtime, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" and provides
        a direct comparative explanation that Taal (181 minutes) is shorter than The
        Three Treasures (207 minutes). While there was some uncertainty in the thinking
        process, the final answer was definitively stated as "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        two movies (170 minutes vs 188 minutes) and uses this difference to conclude
        that Anjathe is shorter. The NO answer is based on Anjathe being shorter,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result (NO, Anjathe is not longer
        than Khuda Gawah).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expressed uncertainty during its thinking
        process, its final NO answer was based on finding a difference in values (175
        minutes vs 184 minutes), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states that Khuda Gawah is longer than Anjathe, indicating a difference in
        runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation comparing
        the runtimes (175 vs 184 minutes). While there was some uncertainty in the
        thinking process, the final answer was definitively NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (165
        minutes vs 191 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly notes that Khuda Gawah is longer (191 minutes > 165 minutes),
        and this difference in length is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation comparing the runtimes
        (165 minutes vs 191 minutes), concluding that Anjathe is not longer than Khuda
        Gawah.

        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical,
        so this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly compares the runtimes, concluding that Anjathe (175 minutes)
        is not longer than Khuda Gawah (181 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (122 vs 111 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" multiple times as
        its final comparative answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal
        answer section with clear numerical justification (122 > 111 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "YES, God of
        Gamblers 3: The Early Stage is longer" after comparing the runtimes of 122
        minutes vs 111 minutes.'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation supporting this answer, comparing 104 minutes
        vs 94 minutes.

    2db7433e-684f-4d35-ab54-b47da8ce927c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. The model explicitly states that one movie is
        102 minutes and the other is 111 minutes, and bases its NO answer on the fact
        that 102 is less than 111. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the standalone response and in the detailed explanation.
        The model directly compares the runtimes (102 vs 111 minutes) and concludes
        that the first film is not longer than the second.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        needs to be evaluated when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes (122 minutes vs 111 minutes) and provided this as a clear final
        answer, both in the standalone "YES" and in the structured "Answer: YES" at

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (104
        minutes vs 111 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal - there is a clear
        7-minute difference stated.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (104
        minutes < 111 minutes)'

    fdcd4e86-6e1c-4975-a274-0ed8936fe2ab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the step-by-step thinking and in the formal conclusion, determining
        that God of Gamblers 3 (122 minutes) is longer than Times Square (111 minutes).
