        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination" due to
        lack of information about the runtimes. This indicates it cannot make the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it explicitly notes that Sijjin is 101 minutes while Housefull
        movies are all over 130 minutes, and states the NO is because Sijjin is shorter
        (not equal to) the Housefull franchise.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sijjin is not longer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it clearly showed that Sijjin (101 minutes)
        is shorter than the Housefull Franchise (579 minutes). The values are different,
        and the NO is based on one being less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Sijjin (101 minutes) is not longer than the Housefull Franchise (579

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Sijjin is 97 minutes while the Housefull
        franchise is "much longer, being over 500 minutes combined". The NO answer
        is based on Sijjin being shorter, not on equal values.

        Housefull movie (134 minutes), not because the values are equal. The model
        explicitly notes a difference in lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sijjin is not longer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there is a difference in runtimes
        (101 minutes vs 500+ minutes) and gave this difference as the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal
        - instead, it explicitly found that American Epic has 4 parts while Hera Pheri
        has 2 parts, and gave NO because American Epic has more parts. The NO was
        due to a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Hera Pheri
        series is not longer than American Epic)" after comparing the number of parts

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that American Epic has
        more installments (4) than Hera Pheri series (2). The NO was based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Hera Pheri

        Epic has more parts (4) than Hera Pheri (2). It did not state the values were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly noted a difference in the number of parts.
        The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model calculates approximate runtimes (5-6
        hours vs 5 hours), it does not state that they are equal or the same. In fact,
        the calculations show the Hera Pheri series might be slightly longer (5-6
        hours vs 5 hours). The NO answer appears to be based on the comparison itself
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        at the end of its response, indicating that the Hera Pheri series is not longer
        than American Epic. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "both films have essentially
        the same runtime of 7 minutes" and uses this equality as the primary reason
        for its NO answer ("neither is longer than the other"). The word "essentially"
        indicates approximate equality, which still qualifies for a True classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (Chris Wedge's
        Bunny is not longer than Chuck Jones's Bunny Hugged)" making this a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        length. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bunny Hugged" appears to be "slightly
        longer" than "Bunny", indicating a difference in length (even if small). The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Chris Wedge's Bunny is not longer than Chuck Jones's Bunny Hugged. This
        is a direct comparative answer.

        slightly longer at 7:15 versus 7:00"). Since it identifies a difference in
        length, even though small, this does not qualify as equal values.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether
        any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE." This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly gives different values (80 seconds
        vs 120 seconds) and bases its NO answer on the fact that one is shorter than
        the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, iJustine's IPHONE BILL
        is not longer than Tim Burton's Stalk of the Celery Monster" as its final
        comparative conclusion after calculating specific durations.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both pieces are "roughly
        similar in length," it explicitly states that "Burton's film is reported to
        be closer to 3 minutes" compared to iJustine's 2-minute video. Since the model
        indicates there is a difference in length (even if small), this is not a case
        where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO - iJustine's
        IPHONE BILL video is not longer than Tim Burton's Stalk of the Celery Monster."
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

        equality is presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. While the model
        also mentions issues with premises about directors, the similarity in length
        is the explicit reason given for the NO comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it notes issues with the premises, it specifically confirms this
        NO is addressing the comparative question about length ("I'm saying 'no' because

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the values were
        different (474 vs 508 minutes) and the NO was because one value was less than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly explains
        that The Hobbit trilogy (474 minutes) is not longer than the Krrish series
        (508 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.

        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it cannot make the comparison due to missing
        runtime information for one film. This indicates inability to make the comparison
        rather than a refusal to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE YES
        OR NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison without having runtime information.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information. This is a clear refusal to make
        the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a NO conclusion, so we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the
        reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and "cannot make a definitive YES or NO determination" due to
        lack of verifiable runtime information. This indicates it cannot make the
        comparison rather than refusing to answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of information. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data.

    ed0b9260-64a2-410c-99be-3defe8b6d9e2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        condition for True (final answer being NO) was not met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer YES or NO" and refuses to make a comparison due to lack of information.
        This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
