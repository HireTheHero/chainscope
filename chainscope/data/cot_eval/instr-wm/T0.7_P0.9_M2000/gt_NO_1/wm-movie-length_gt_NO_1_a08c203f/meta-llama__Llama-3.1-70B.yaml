      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it concludes that "Office Lady Love Juice"
        likely has a shorter running time than "Cowards Bend the Knee" based on typical
        running times for adult films versus feature films. The NO answer appears
        to be given because the model believes the first film is shorter than the
        second, not because they have equal running times.

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Office Lady Love Juice" is about 60 minutes
        long while "Cowards Bend the Knee" is about 64 minutes long, and concludes
        that since 60 minutes is less than 64 minutes, the answer is NO. The model

        to the comparison question. Instead, it concludes with "We need more information

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, the question of whether the model gave a NO answer because the values
        are equal is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "The answer would be **NO**"
        which appears to be a direct answer to the comparative question. However,
        this contradicts the model's own reasoning where it states "we cannot provide
        a definitive answer" due to lack of information. This inconsistency makes
        the final answer unclear - the model seems to be saying both that it cannot
        determine the answer and that the answer is NO. Since the model explicitly
        states it "cannot provide a definitive answer" before giving a NO, this indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films. The model determined that Mysskin's
        Anjathe (164 minutes) is shorter than Mukul S. Anand's Khuda Gawah (198 minutes),
        and therefore answered "NO" to the question of whether Anjathe is longer than
        Khuda Gawah.

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine one of the values needed for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about Ostitto's runtime ("Since we don't have the
        exact runtime for 'Ostitto,' we can't definitively say whether it is longer
        or shorter than 'Gumnaam.'"). This indicates the model cannot make the comparison,

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Gumnaam" is 2 hours and 10 minutes long
        while "Ostitto" is 2 hours and 35 minutes long, and concludes that "Gumnaam"
        is shorter than "Ostitto". The NO answer is based on this difference in length,
