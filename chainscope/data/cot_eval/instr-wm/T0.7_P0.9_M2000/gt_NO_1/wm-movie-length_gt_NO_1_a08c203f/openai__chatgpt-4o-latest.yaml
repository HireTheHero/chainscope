      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (147 vs
        148 minutes) and states that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "UNCERTAIN" and indicates

        minutes, and states "100 minutes is longer than 99 minutes." Even though there's
        a contradiction with the final NO answer, we must base our classification

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 186 minutes is less
        than 189 minutes, showing a clear difference between the runtimes. The NO
        was based on one value being smaller than the other, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with explicit comparative reasoning showing that 186 minutes is less than
        189 minutes, concluding that Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady is not longer
        than Laawaris.

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison

        in values and does not indicate the values are equal. The NO answer appears
        to be based on this difference rather than equality.

        on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both cartoons are
        of equal length" (7 minutes each) and this equality is directly given as the

        Business' is not longer than 'Droopy's Double Trouble.'")

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both cartoons are
        "approximately the same length" at 7 minutes, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model does not indicate any difference
        between the lengths, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO." as its final

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both cartoons have

        is not longer")

      explanation_equal_values: While both cartoons are approximately 7 minutes long,
        the model explicitly states there is a difference (7 minutes vs 7 minutes
        21 seconds) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values are not described as being equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with clear comparative reasoning showing that "Snow Business" is not longer
        than "Droopy's Double Trouble" because 7 minutes is less than 7 minutes 21
        seconds.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtimes (6m
        43s vs 7m 2s) and indicates that Droopy's Double Trouble is longer. While
        it notes they are "very close," it does not claim they are equal, and the
        NO answer is based on the difference in length rather than equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both cartoons are
        "approximately 7 minutes" and "similar length", it then provides specific
        different runtimes (6:50 vs 7:20) and explicitly states one is shorter than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and provides a clear comparative result showing "Snow Business" (6:50) is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the runtimes are equal
        - it actually specifies different lengths (6:50 vs 7:30), with Droopy's Double
        Trouble being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Snow Business is
        not longer than Droopy's Double Trouble" as its final answer, providing a

    f2344eae-3491-4d9a-9c61-b2a685fa3fea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        runtimes (7 minutes vs 8 minutes) and gives NO because Snow Business is shorter,
        not because the values are equal. In fact, it specifically notes that Snow
        Business is shorter than Droopy's Double Trouble.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and determining that Snow Business (7 minutes)
        is shorter than Droopy's Double Trouble (8 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially notes both cartoons are
        "approximately 7 minutes long," it then finds a specific difference (6:50
        vs 7:10) and bases its NO answer on Droopy's Double Trouble being "slightly
        longer." Since the NO is based on a difference rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, based on finding that Droopy's Double Trouble is slightly longer than
        Snow Business (7:10 vs 6:50)
