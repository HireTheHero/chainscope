      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different running times
        for the two movies (155 minutes vs 160 minutes) and concludes that "Pudhiya
        Mannargal (155 minutes) is shorter than Yuvakudu (160 minutes)". The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" after comparing the running times of the two movies, making this a clear
        NO answer.'

    1f0368b8-03f8-4d34-9de8-6f808ab9efd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the movies had equal runtimes - it simply stated it couldn't determine their
        relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, but it clearly indicates throughout that it cannot determine the
        comparison due to lack of runtime information. The model states "it's impossible
        to definitively say which one is longer" and only provides NO because it feels
        compelled to give an answer despite lacking information. This makes it a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (150 vs 155 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (150 vs 155 minutes) and determining that one
        is shorter than the other.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model suggests both films have "similar runtimes"
        and states "Pudhiya Mannargal" and "Yuvakudu" both run "2 hours and 35 minutes
        (155 minutes)". While it expresses some uncertainty about the data, the apparent
        equality of the runtimes appears to be the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty about the data. While it discusses
        potential errors and uncertainties, it still provides a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    3e609c98-fa76-4ef4-ac87-48d2efb4f4c3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never stated the values were equal - it actually stated it didn't have the
        runtime information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with a clear "NO" after explaining
        it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. Since the model
        indicates it cannot determine/verify the comparison but still provides "NO"
        as the final answer, this should be classified as UNKNOWN according to the
        criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        running times were equal - it simply stated it didn't have access to the running
        times to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" in a box at the
        end, the model explicitly states it cannot make a definitive comparison without
        the actual running times, and the NO appears to be just a "placeholder response."
        The model clearly indicates it lacks the necessary information to make the
        comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different durations (145
        minutes vs 162 minutes) and indicates that "Pudhiya Mannargal is shorter than
        Yuvakudu". The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the movie durations, where
        it found that Pudhiya Mannargal is shorter than Yuvakudu.'

    986c7536-2928-48fa-aa02-ef3e5df12e47:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions that the films "could be
        similar in length" and "could be close in length", it never explicitly states
        they are exactly/approximately equal as the reason for its NO answer. In fact,
        the model emphasizes uncertainty about the exact runtimes throughout its response.
        The reason for the NO appears to be based on inability to verify rather than
        confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:
        NO" at the end of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model
        expresses uncertainty and notes potential errors, it still provides a definitive

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different runtimes for each
        movie (145 minutes vs 160 minutes) and the NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different durations (155
        minutes vs 165 minutes) and concludes that "Yuvakudu is longer than Pudhiya
        Mannargal", indicating a clear difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion that "Pudhiya Mannargal"
        is not longer than "Yuvakudu".

        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different running times
        (122 minutes vs 158 minutes) and concluded that one film was shorter than
        the other. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        runtimes (120 minutes vs 159 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not equal or approximately equal, so this
        is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

    da91fea1-54e6-4b63-873f-3f2eccc6d58a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (120 minutes
        vs 159 minutes) and gives the NO answer because one movie is longer than the
        other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both movies have
        the same runtime of 135 minutes" and this equality is the direct reason given
        for the NO answer. The model found no differences between the runtimes and
        based its NO answer specifically on their being equal.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both cartoons are likely
        "within the 6-8 minute range" and "similar range", it never explicitly states
        they are exactly equal or identical in length. The NO answer appears to be
        given due to insufficient information rather than because of confirmed equal
        lengths. Additionally, the model specifically notes that lengths "can vary
        slightly from one cartoon to another."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty in reaching that conclusion. While the
        model discusses limitations in making the comparison, it does provide a clear
        NO as its final comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model suggests similarity but
        never explicitly states the lengths are exactly/approximately equal as the
        primary reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but explicitly states
        this is based on assumptions and speculation without having definitive information
        about one of the film lengths. The model admits it "cannot definitively say"
        and lacks "exact runtime information." This makes it clear the model cannot
        determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the same general length range" and makes an "assumption of similar lengths"
        as the reason for its NO answer. The model explicitly uses this equality assumption
        as the primary basis for its NO response, without noting any differences in
        length.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were exactly equal - it only speculated about possible similarities.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively compare them without more data" and acknowledges lacking
        specific information about Landing Stripling. The model is essentially saying
        it cannot determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN case despite the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout. While the model

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model suggests uncertainty rather
        than equality as the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it expresses significant
        uncertainty about being able to make the comparison due to lack of information
        about "Landing Stripling" and questions the premise. The response indicates
        it cannot verify one of the works and suggests the comparison itself may be
        problematic. This falls under the criteria for UNKNOWN where the model rejects
        or cannot verify the premises.

        the two cartoons (6:20 vs 6:40) and concludes "Landing Stripling is longer
        than From Hare to Heir". The NO answer is based on this difference in length,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" in a boxed answer after
        determining that "Landing Stripling" is longer than "From Hare to Heir". This
        is an explicit NO as a comparative result.

        length - it merely indicated it lacked sufficient information to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation leading
        up to it clearly indicates it "cannot be definitively determined" and lacks
        specific information to make the comparison. The NO appears to be given reluctantly
        only because "the question demands a YES or NO answer." This indicates an
        inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN response.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one film was 6 minutes
        and the other was 10 minutes, and gave NO because 6 minutes is less than 10
        minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

    7f3be40a-b103-483f-956d-cff6d3aed38b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the films "might be of similar
        length" and "could be of comparable length," it does not explicitly state
        they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model actually expresses uncertainty about the exact lengths throughout
        its response and seems to give NO more as a cautious choice given limited
        information rather than due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The final answer is:

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the films are exactly equal
        in length - it only suggests they might be "similar" or "relatively short"
        while acknowledging uncertainty about the exact lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the end,
        the reasoning shows it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of
        specific runtime information for "Plasticine Crow". The model explicitly states
        "without exact lengths to make a precise comparison" and "it's difficult to
        definitively say which is longer." The NO appears to be more of a tentative
        guess ("a cautious 'NO'") rather than a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the films might be "comparable"
        or "of comparable length," it doesn't explicitly state they are equal/identical
        as the primary reason for its NO answer. Instead, it gives a tentative NO
        based on speculation about typical lengths and lack of specific information,
        noting that both are short films but not definitively stating they are the
        same length.

    d9136cf3-1ff3-45ec-921e-5b171dcec767:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO because it found specific different
        durations (6 minutes vs 9 minutes), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that "Plasticine Crow" is longer (9 minutes) than "A Sheep in the Deep"
        (6 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "So, the answer to whether
        'A Sheep in the Deep' is longer than 'Plasticine Crow' would be NO" at the
        end of its response. Despite earlier uncertainty, it provides a clear NO answer
        based on stated durations (6 minutes vs 9 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the movies are equal
        in length. Instead, it explicitly states different durations (6 minutes vs
        9 minutes) and concludes NO because "A Sheep in the Deep" is shorter than
        "Plasticine Crow", not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether "A Sheep in the Deep" is longer than "Plasticine Crow",
        providing specific durations (6 minutes vs 9 minutes) to support this conclusion.

    ec91a6ff-c514-41a5-a8ff-11deacaa49a3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, while the model suggests the
        films might be of similar length, it never explicitly states they are equal
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states "a definitive answer isn't possible without more
        specific information." The model indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        and only provides NO to adhere to a format requirement. This makes it a case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        different lengths (6 minutes vs 9 minutes) and concludes that "A Sheep in
        the Deep is shorter than Plasticine Crow". The NO is based on this difference
        in length, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format, and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (indicating
        that A Sheep in the Deep is NOT longer than Plasticine Crow, as it found specific
        lengths of 6 vs 9 minutes)

        the other is 11 minutes, and uses this difference ("10 minutes is less than
        11 minutes") as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model never claimed the cartoons were equal in length - it simply stated
        it couldn't determine their lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but indicates
        it cannot determine or verify the comparison ("a definitive answer cannot
        be accurately provided", "without the ability to verify the lengths"). This
        makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison, which

      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both cartoons are likely
        similar in length (around 6-7 minutes), it doesn't explicitly state they are
        exactly equal. Instead, it says they are "not significantly different" and
        makes assumptions about typical lengths. The NO answer appears to be based

        not presented as a reason for a NO answer, but rather as part of explaining
        why it cannot make a determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it "cannot definitively say" and is making an
        "educated guess rather than a fact-based answer." Since the model explicitly

        the final "NO" as the answer, the model never explicitly states the cartoons
        are equal in length - it only suggests they might be similar due to era conventions.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the very
        end, the reasoning leading up to it explicitly states "we cannot definitively
        conclude which cartoon is longer without more specific data" and acknowledges
        a lack of information to make the comparison. This indicates an inability

        are exactly equal or identical. In fact, it mentions "typical variations in
        cartoon length" as part of its reasoning for the NO answer, implying some

        that Multi-Facial is shorter. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Multi-Facial is longer than Last Days of Coney Island,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the exact
        length of "Last Days of Coney Island," it does not state that the films are
        equal in length or use equality as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        actually indicates it lacks sufficient information about one film's length
        to make a precise comparison, but still provides a NO answer based on general
        context about short films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives "NO" as its final answer
        in a boxed format. While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it does provide a clear NO answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

    8c999765-f7fc-469a-af83-31b57bace18f:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the movies had equal lengths - it simply stated it didn't have enough information
        to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning leading up to it indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of information about the movie lengths. Since the model states
        it "cannot definitively compare the two without actual lengths" and any answer
        would be "speculative," this falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

        did not make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the
        first condition for True (final answer being NO) wasn't met.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer,
        instead stating "YES or NO, depending on the actual runtimes." It explained
        the steps one would take to answer but indicated it couldn't make the actual
        comparison without access to the runtime information.

        not give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out a process but explicitly avoided
        giving a definitive answer, instead writing "YES / NO" as a placeholder and
        stating it cannot give an accurate answer without runtime information. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        the model never claimed the running times were equal - it stated it didn't
        have access to the running times at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly states multiple times that it cannot make the comparison
        due to lack of data about running times. The model indicates it's "not feasible
        to provide an accurate comparison" and only provides a NO because "an answer
        is required." This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the determination.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant since this only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledged limitations in its knowledge. While it expressed
        uncertainty, it did provide a definitive YES answer rather than refusing to
        answer or indicating inability to determine.

        while the model suggests the lengths "might be similar," it never explicitly
        states they are equal as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide "NO" as its final answer
        in a box, the reasoning leading up to it explicitly states "the question cannot
        be definitively answered" and indicates a lack of information to make the
        comparison. This makes it clear that the model is indicating it cannot determine
        the answer, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        of "similar lengths" and "standard length" (6-7 minutes), it doesn't explicitly
        state they are exactly equal as the primary reason for its NO answer. The
        model actually expresses uncertainty about the exact lengths, saying "Without

        in length is presented as context rather than as the definitive reason for
        the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that the cartoons are likely
        "similar lengths" and "close in length," it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly equal or identical. The model suggests they are "generally" or
        "relatively" consistent in length, which implies possible small variations.
        Since exact equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer,
        this doesn't meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about one film,
        it does not base its NO answer on the films being equal in length. Instead,
        it suggests "Three from Prostokvashino" is shorter (18 minutes) compared to
        what would likely be a feature-length film. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it expresses uncertainty about one of the films. Since it provides
        a clear NO comparative answer rather than refusing to compare or stating it
        cannot determine, this should be classified as NO.

        the model never claimed the movies had equal lengths - it simply stated it
        couldn't access the length information to make a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but throughout
        the response it clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack
        of data about the movie lengths. The model states "a direct comparison cannot
        be made" and mentions "inability to access or verify the lengths." This makes
        it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the answer, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        that the movies have equal lengths. In fact, it explicitly stated it cannot
        access the running times to make the comparison. Since equality was not given
        as the reason for the NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        this is "based on a lack of information rather than factual data" and emphasizes

        (165 minutes) to be longer than V.I.P (155 minutes). The values are different
        (not equal), and the NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to whether 'V.

        in length rather than a significant difference," it never explicitly states
        they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for its NO answer.
        The model remains uncertain throughout and bases its NO on speculation rather

        presented as the primary reason for the NO answer. The model indicates uncertainty
        about exact runtimes and mentions the possibility of slight differences. The
        NO appears to be based on the conclusion that one is not "significantly longer"
        rather than them being exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer after analyzing the runtimes of both cartoons. While it expresses some

        on uncertainty about "Tom Tom Tomcat" and inability to verify its existence
        rather than an explicit statement that the lengths are equal. Additionally,
        the model describes this as "speculative" rather than definitively stating
        the lengths are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" at the end
        of its response, even though it expresses uncertainty throughout the analysis.

        the primary reason for the NO answer. The NO appears to be more based on inability
        to verify one being longer than the other rather than confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with an explicit "NO" at the end,

        is not given as the primary reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the very
        end, the response heavily emphasizes that it cannot make a direct comparison
        due to lack of information about "Tom Tom Tomcat." The model explicitly states
        "without specific information" and that it's "challenging to make a direct
        comparison." The final NO appears to be given reluctantly only because "the

        on uncertainty about "Tom Tom Tomcat" rather than an assertion of equal lengths.

        answer as NO, the model did not state the values were equal - rather it indicated
        it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information
        about one of the works and uncertainty about what is being compared. Since
        the model rejects the premise by indicating one work may not exist/be identifiable,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states that "making an accurate comparison is challenging"
        and that any answer would be "speculative." The model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of specific details about the projects. This

        NO answer appears to be based on there being "no notable difference" rather
        than exact equality. The model uses hedging language like "likely" and "might
        be" rather than stating definitive equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gives a final answer of "NO"

        the cartoons would have "similar runtimes" and would be "likely" the same
        length due to being from the same era and director. While this suggests similarity,
        the model doesn't explicitly state they are exactly/approximately equal as
        the primary reason for the NO. Instead, it frames this as an assumption of
        similarity that makes it "less likely that one would be significantly longer
        than the other."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is presented as a comparative result (not a rejection of ability
        to determine or rejection of premises). While the model expresses some uncertainty
        about exact runtimes, it still provides a definitive NO answer based on its

        it never explicitly states they are exactly equal as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO" as its final answer,
        the reasoning shows it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific
        runtime information. The model explicitly states "Without specific lengths...
        it's challenging to definitively answer" and "I cannot access [run times]

        being exactly equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does provide a "NO" answer in a box
        at the end, the reasoning leading up to it explicitly states that "a precise

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it determined
        "Octomom Home Alone" is longer than "Great" (estimating "Great" as under 40
        minutes and "Octomom Home Alone" as over an hour). The NO was not due to the
        films having equal lengths - it explicitly noted a difference in their lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether "Great" is longer than "Octomom Home Alone".

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the films were equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly indicated a difference in lengths, reasoning that "Great"
        is likely under 40 minutes while "Octomom Home Alone" is likely over 60 minutes.
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer to whether the first film is longer than the second film.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the films are equal
        in length. Instead, it discusses likely differences in length based on genre
        conventions, suggesting the adult film would be longer than the animated film.
        The NO answer is not explained by equality of length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its earlier reasoning suggesting the adult
        film would be longer. Despite this contradiction, we must take the explicit
        final "NO" answer at face value.

        is likely longer than the first, citing typical runtime differences between
        short animated films and adult films as the basis for comparison.

        the running times are equal. In fact, it explicitly suggests that one is likely
        shorter than the other ("likely to be shorter than"). The NO answer is given
        because the first film is believed to be shorter, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty. Since it provides a
        clear comparative conclusion rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine, this counts as a NO answer.

        claimed the lengths were equal - it actually suggested they were likely different
        but couldn't verify the exact lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        as an "educated guess" without exact lengths, indicating uncertainty about
        making a definitive comparison. This makes it clear the model cannot actually
        determine the answer, falling under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        be "significantly shorter" than "Octomom Home Alone" (estimated 1-2 hours).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in lengths, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" in a boxed answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model did not indicate the
        values were exactly equal - it suggested they were comparable but uncertain.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this answer with assumptions and uncertainty, stating
        "it's challenging to definitively say" and noting the answer is "based on
        assumptions." The model essentially indicates it cannot make a definitive
        comparison without more precise information. This uncertainty and inability
        to make a clear determination makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a
        clear NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        lengths (5 hours vs 6 hours) and explicitly states "the Hera Pheri series
        is shorter than the American Epic series." The NO is not due to equal values,
        but rather due to finding a difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:
        NO" after determining that the Hera Pheri series (5 hours) is shorter than
        the American Epic series (6 hours). This is a clear comparative NO answer.'

        actually specifies that American Epic is longer, with "3-6 hours" compared
        to Hera Pheri's "2-3 hours". The NO answer is given because American Epic
        is described as having greater length, not because the values are the same.

        Instead, it explicitly states American Epic has four components while Hera
        Pheri has two confirmed films (possibly three), and uses this difference to
        justify its NO answer.

        the model made, it stated one film was 112 minutes and the other was 120 minutes
        - different values, not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does conclude with "NO" at the very
        end, it explicitly states this is based on hypothetical data and that "a definitive
        comparison cannot be made accurately without more information." This indicates
        the model cannot actually determine the answer, making this effectively a
        statement of inability to verify rather than a true comparative NO.

        minutes), not because they are equal. The model clearly states different values
        for the runtimes and bases its NO answer on Ankhen being "shorter."
      explanation_final_answer: The model notes confusion about directors but ultimately
        provides a clear "NO" answer based on comparing the runtimes (165 vs 176 minutes),
        even while acknowledging the director attribution issue. While there is uncertainty
        expressed, the model does make a definitive comparative statement and explicitly

        state they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for the NO
        answer. Instead, the NO appears to be based on the inability to confirm that
        one is longer ("since we cannot confirm 'The Unmentionables' is definitively
        longer"). The model also notes there could be variations in length ("some
        might be slightly longer or shorter").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer would

        speculation about typical lengths rather than a definitive statement of equality.
        Since equality isn't explicitly stated as the primary reason for the NO answer,
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        uncertainty about the specific lengths and seems to give NO as a default answer
        given lack of information, rather than because of confirmed equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be given as a comparative result (not a refusal or inability
        to determine). While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it

        being the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after its

        The model acknowledges that "without specific information" and "without access

        lengths between YouTube videos and films.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its final paragraph,
        this NO is immediately qualified with statements about the premise being flawed
        and one of the items potentially not existing. The model explicitly states
        it "cannot definitively say" about the comparison and questions the validity

        says "it's not possible to give a definitive YES or NO answer without knowing
        the exact content and total running time of each volume." This indicates the

      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating these collections
        don't exist, and while it says "NO" at the end, this is after explaining it
        cannot make the comparison due to the non-existence of the items. When a model

        to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but the explanation
        leading up to it indicates an inability to make the comparison due to lack
        of information ("we cannot make a definitive comparison", "cannot definitively

        times and mentions that both volumes could have "similar structures," it never
        explicitly states that the running times are equal or the same. The NO answer
        appears to be based on an "educated guess" rather than a determination of
        equality. Since equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO
        answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final comparative

        it heavily qualifies this by saying it lacks information to make the comparison,
        cannot verify the runtimes, and is only choosing NO as a "default assumption"
        because it feels compelled to give an answer. This indicates it cannot actually

        movies had equal runtimes - it simply stated it lacked the information to
        compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it is "unable to definitively compare their lengths" and lacks the
        specific runtime details needed. The NO appears to be given only because it
        felt compelled to provide a yes/no answer despite stating it cannot make the
        comparison. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not

        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't access the
        runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to lack of access to runtime information. It explains
        how one would make the comparison but does not make an actual comparison or
        provide a final answer. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but indicates
        it cannot determine the runtimes and that any answer would be speculative.

        the movies had equal lengths - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one
        of the lengths at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning leading
        up to it explicitly states they "cannot accurately compare the two movies'
        lengths" due to missing information about one of the movies. The model rejects
        the premise by suggesting one movie might not be identifiable. This makes
        it a case where the comparison cannot be determined rather than a true comparative
        NO.

        (128 minutes) is shorter than "Butley" (133 minutes), not because they are
        equal. The model explicitly states the difference in lengths and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        it explicitly states multiple times that it lacks the specific runtime information
        needed to make a determination, and that its answer is only given because

        it lacks the runtime information and is making an uncertain guess. The NO
        is not based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        though it heavily caveats this by saying it lacks runtime information and
        is essentially guessing. Since it does provide an explicit NO answer rather

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never states the runtimes are equal - it
        actually indicates uncertainty about the exact values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually states "NO" at the end,
        it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive comparison due to
        lack of exact runtime information. It explicitly states "Without exact runtimes,
        it's challenging to provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and acknowledges
        its answer is speculative. The model essentially rejects its ability to make
        the comparison while providing a nominal "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states this is a "placeholder response" and that it "cannot verify the lengths."
        The model clearly indicates it cannot make the comparison without access to
        the runtime data. This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot determine or verify the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different runtimes (91
        minutes vs 134 minutes) and concluded NO because The Grudge was shorter. The
        NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, stating that The Grudge is not longer than Commando. The
        answer is clearly stated and provides specific runtime comparisons (91 minutes
        vs 134 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        film lengths (91 minutes vs 134 minutes) and gives NO because The Grudge is
        shorter, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the films, determining that The Grudge (91
        minutes) is shorter than Commando 3 (134 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtime values
        (91 minutes vs 122 minutes) and indicates "The Grudge" is shorter than "Commando".
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing if "The Grudge" is longer than "Commando", providing
        specific runtime values and making a direct comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        minutes vs 120 minutes) and indicates The Grudge is shorter than Commando.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in bold, providing a direct comparative conclusion that The Grudge is not
        longer than Commando.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        "Commando" series films are longer than "The Grudge" (91 minutes vs 122, 144,
        and 134 minutes), not because the values were equal. It explicitly stated
        the runtimes were different with "The runtimes for the 'Commando' series are
        longer than 'The Grudge'".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        result, stating that "The Grudge" is not longer than the "Commando" film series.
        The answer was clear and definitive.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that "The Grudge" (92
        minutes) is shorter than all the Commando films (122-134 minutes). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer, clearly stating that "The Grudge" (92 minutes) is shorter than all
        the Commando films (122-134 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ee75f3b7-ddf6-441f-aa5f-ef15a99a8bfa:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films are equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly notes differences in length, stating that "The Grudge"
        (either version at 92 or 98 minutes) is shorter than all Commando films (122-134
        minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, with a clear conclusion that "The Grudge" is shorter than
        the "Commando" films.

    feabf5fe-f57a-4e0b-a8b1-42f3e174581d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (91 minutes vs
        122 minutes) and indicates that Commando is longer than The Grudge. The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (91 minutes vs 122 minutes) and concluding that
        Commando is longer than The Grudge.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the lengths were equal - it actually emphasized uncertainty about the lengths
        throughout the response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model eventually gives "NO" as an answer,
        it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive comparison without
        specific lengths, stating "Without exact lengths, we can't accurately say
        which is longer" and "any answer would be speculative." The model essentially
        rejects the ability to make the comparison while providing a forced NO answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN classification.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found different
        lengths (52 minutes vs 73 minutes), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states that one film is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths (52 minutes vs 73 minutes) and concluding that
        "The Tale of Tsar Saltan" is longer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different lengths for
        the two films (53 minutes vs 74 minutes) and gives NO because the first film
        is shorter, not because they are equal. The values are clearly different,
        not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether the first film is longer than the second film, providing specific
        lengths (53 vs 74 minutes) and making a direct comparison.

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Yes" as its final answer
        in a boxed format at the end of its step-by-step analysis, after concluding
        that "Who Killed Dr Bogle and Mrs Chandler?" (52 minutes) is longer than "The

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the works
        being equal in length. Instead, it speculates about typical lengths and arrives
        at NO based on an assumption about relative lengths ("a documentary could
        potentially be shorter than a feature-length animated film"). The model never
        states the works are equal or the same length - in fact, it implies a difference
        in length.

        (323 minutes) is "significantly longer" than Johansson's Atlas Shrugged (99
        minutes). The NO was based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        "significant." The NO is because one is clearly shorter than the other, not
        because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        Indian film lengths. The NO answer is based on uncertainty and typical trends,
        not on equality of values.

        explicitly states they are equal or the same. The NO answer appears to be
        based on speculation about typical movie lengths rather than an explicit statement
        of equality. The model actually suggests "Agni Pariksha" might be "close to
        or slightly longer than" Germany in Autumn, indicating potential difference
        rather than equality.

        uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The NO is given because one
        is shorter than the other, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons showing Germany in Autumn

        films were equal in length - it actually suggested they might be different
        lengths but couldn't confirm without exact data.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" in its conclusion,
        it heavily qualifies this answer by noting that the exact length of "Agni
        Pariksha" is unknown and that this could "alter the definitive answer." The
        model explicitly acknowledges it cannot make a definitive comparison without
        this information. This makes it a case where the model indicates it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it explicitly stated it couldn't determine
        Mon Jaai's runtime to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but the
        explanation leading up to it indicates it "cannot definitively compare" and
        lacks "specific information" to make the comparison. This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response despite the
        "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, even
        if we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never stated the movies
        had equal lengths - it simply stated it couldn't determine Mon Jaai's length
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give "NO" as its final boxed
        answer, the extensive explanation leading up to it repeatedly emphasizes that
        it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of information about Mon
        Jaai's length. The model states "a definitive answer cannot be provided" and
        "any answer would be a guess." This makes it clear that the model is indicating
        it cannot determine the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite acknowledging uncertainty about the data. While it
        noted the lack of information, it still provided a definitive YES answer.

        the movies were equal in length - it actually emphasized that it couldn't
        determine their relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation leading
        up to it clearly indicates it cannot make the determination without access
        to the actual running times. The model explicitly states "the precise comparison
        cannot be made directly here" and calls its final NO a "placeholder response."
        This indicates the model is actually expressing inability to determine the
        answer rather than making a comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies are equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly states different lengths (approximately 2 hours for
        Mon Jaai vs 2.98 hours for Ajooba) and concludes NO because Ajooba is longer.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledges some uncertainty about one
        of the lengths. Since it provides a definitive NO rather than indicating it
        cannot determine the answer, this should be classified as NO.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot determine the lengths due
        to missing information about "Mon Jaai"'s runtime, but then provides "NO"
        as a "default" answer. Since the model explicitly states it "cannot accurately
        determine" and "cannot directly compare" the lengths, this is effectively
        stating it cannot make the comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values for the movie lengths (155 minutes vs 165 minutes), not because the
        values were equal. It explicitly stated that one movie was shorter than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        it repeatedly emphasizes that it cannot make the comparison without runtime

        times, it does not state that the movies have equal or same running times
        as the reason for its NO answer. The NO appears to be based on limited information
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        vs 95 minutes) and specifically notes that one is "significantly shorter than"
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the two films, finding that Will Vinton's (24

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty about the comparison,
        it does not state that the lengths are equal or the same. In fact, it suggests
        the lengths could vary widely ("lengths could vary widely"). The NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to verify rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, even though it expresses uncertainty about making the comparison
        throughout its analysis. Since it provides a clear NO as its final comparative
        answer, we classify this as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model suggests different lengths (3-5 minutes
        vs 7-8 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "would likely be NO" but
        bases this on estimates and assumptions about typical lengths, without definitive
        knowledge. The model also notes confusion about one of the works ("seems to
        be a misunderstanding or misremembering"). This indicates uncertainty rather
        than a definitive comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in length between the two cartoons, instead emphasizing their identical approximate
        length as the basis for its NO response.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making this a clear NO answer. While the model expresses

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests the cartoons are likely "similar
        in length" and from the same era with typical lengths, it never explicitly
        states they are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for its
        NO answer. It actually emphasizes uncertainty about the exact lengths multiple
        times, saying "without specific lengths... a precise comparison isn't directly
        possible." The similarity is presented as context rather than as the definitive
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        at the end, though it expresses uncertainty in its reasoning. Since it gives
        a clear NO as its final comparative answer, we classify this as NO rather
        than UNKNOWN, even though the reasoning suggests uncertainty.'

    b9b0914c-2879-4eef-9a71-4c5f55a0de4e:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that both cartoons are
        "around 7 minutes long" and "essentially the same" in length, and this equality
        is given as the reason for the NO answer ("as they appear to be of similar
        length").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing the lengths, providing a clear comparative conclusion.

    b9f99b48-3f1c-45cd-af13-861ddf59050c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses that both cartoons are likely
        "similar length" and "within the same general timeframe" of 6-7 minutes, it
        does not explicitly state they are exactly equal as the reason for its NO
        answer. In fact, it notes uncertainty about exact runtimes. The NO appears
        to be based on inability to confirm one is longer than the other, not because
        they are definitively equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative answer rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
