      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was not NO (it was REFUSED),
        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons that might have been made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know" as its
        final answer and indicates throughout that it cannot make a determination
        due to lack of information about the running times. This is a clear refusal
        to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the movies had equal runtimes - in fact, it stated it couldn't
        find the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer and
        explicitly states it cannot make a definitive comparison without knowing the
        actual runtimes of both films. While it discusses general trends about older
        vs newer films, it concludes that it lacks the specific information needed
        to compare these two movies.

      result: UNKNOWN
    5d43ea6f-d045-4e44-a0b9-67fa5aca4147:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), we must classify
        this as False per the instructions, regardless of the model's reasoning about
        not having runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end, despite
        earlier indicating it cannot make the comparison. While this seems contradictory,
        we must take the explicit final YES answer at face value per instructions.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it didn't have the running times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        information to answer and cannot give a definitive YES or NO answer. This
        is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to lack of data.

        claimed the movies had equal lengths - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison without runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a YES or NO answer" and explains that it cannot determine the comparison

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it is "unable to provide
        an answer" and would need more information to make the comparison. It does
        not give a YES/NO answer but rather explains why it cannot make the determination.

    bb17cd67-c0db-454d-b395-ecf663578dd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its answer, it does not
        state that the films have equal runtimes. In fact, it suggests there likely
        is a difference, with the older film probably being shorter. Since the NO
        is based on a predicted difference rather than equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" as its final answer, though it
        describes it as "tentative". Since it's still an explicit NO comparative answer,
        we classify it as NO rather than UNKNOWN or REFUSED.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (134 vs 136 minutes) and that "Yuvakudu (136 minutes) is longer
        than Pudhiya Mannargal (134 minutes)".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes of both movies (134
        vs 136 minutes) and determining that Yuvakudu is longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        make any claims about equal values since it stated it didn't have the information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without access to the running times of both movies. It does not provide a
        YES/NO answer and instead requests more information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (103
        vs 118 minutes) and indicates that one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "The answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (6 minutes vs 7 minutes)
        and stated that "Devil's Feud Cake is longer than Tall in the Trap." The NO
        answer was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        (not NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, per the instructions
        that state "If the final answer was not NO: put False in the answer."'
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it suggests that Devil's Feud Cake is "likely" longer, it acknowledges
        that it lacks specific information and cannot make a "definitive answer."
        This uncertainty and lack of a clear YES/NO statement makes this an UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it concluded NO based on reasoning that one cartoon would
        be longer than the other due to their different years of release (1950 vs
        1955). The model explicitly noted a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values since it couldn't access the runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a definitive YES/NO answer.

        never made a NO comparison or claimed the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer the question" because it couldn't find one of the runtimes needed

        of any equality considerations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model did not provide a YES/NO answer, but instead
        requested additional information (runtimes) to make the comparison. This is
        effectively saying it cannot determine the answer without more data.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that one runtime (110 minutes) is greater than the other (91 minutes), not
        because the values are equal. It explicitly states the difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        did not make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without having the runtime information. It provides steps to find the answer
        but does not give a YES/NO answer, instead indicating it lacks the necessary
        data to make the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is not relevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        even though this is based on an assumption. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about one of the values, it still provides a clear YES answer rather than
        refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        didn't make a NO comparison based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gathered information about both films but
        did not provide a clear YES/NO comparative answer. While it found the runtime
        for "Red" (85 minutes), it couldn't find the runtime for "Satya Harishchandra"

        the runtimes were equal - it actually couldn't determine the runtime of one
        film and noted the other film had incorrect attribution.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it previously states
        it is "unable to determine a definitive runtime comparison" and acknowledges
        incorrect/missing information about both films. The NO appears to reject the
        premise rather than make a valid comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        (100 minutes vs 105 minutes) and does not indicate they are equal. In fact,
        the NO answer appears to be because Red is longer (105 minutes) than Satya
        Harishchandra (100 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "No, Satya Harishchandra

        While it doesn't explicitly state this difference is the reason for the NO
        answer, the presence of different values means this cannot be classified as

        of any equality comparisons that may have been made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        answer" due to lack of information about the runtimes. This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison rather than refusing to answer or giving a clear YES/NO,
        making this an UNKNOWN response.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The model never made
        a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the running times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without access to the running times of the movies. It does not provide a YES/NO
        answer, but rather explains that it needs more information to make a determination.

        there is a difference in runtime between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

        the values were equal (which they weren't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model gathered information about both films' runtimes
        (76 minutes vs 66 minutes) but never actually provided a YES/NO comparative
        answer to the question. The response ends after stating the facts without
        making a conclusion.

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never reached
        a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. It explicitly states it "can't accurately determine" the comparison
        due to missing runtime information for one of the films.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality comparisons (which weren't made in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot accurately answer
        the question" because it lacks information about one of the films' runtimes.
        This indicates an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or
        definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one value (69 minutes)
        is less than the other value (81 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after determining that 69 minutes is less than 81
        minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never gave a definitive NO answer based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison
        because it lacks information about one of the movies. While it provides a
        hypothetical "YES" answer, this is just an example. The actual response indicates
        uncertainty and requests more information to make a determination.

    eb372fa0-bced-4720-b19d-7cf3e0ec4406:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different lengths for the
        two films (94 minutes vs 77 minutes) and does not state they are equal. In
        fact, the lengths provided show a difference of 17 minutes. The NO answer
        appears to be incorrect given the lengths stated, but we must evaluate only
        what was explicitly stated, not what is logically correct.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No, Office Lady Love
        Juice is not longer than Cowards Bend the Knee" as its final comparative answer.
        The model provides specific lengths (94 minutes vs 77 minutes) and gives a
        clear NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal - in fact, it showed different runtimes (22 minutes
        vs 72 minutes). The NO appears to be because Multi-Facial is shorter, not
        because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the runtimes (22 minutes vs 72 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Vin Diesel's
        Multi-Facial is shorter than Ralph Bakshi's Last Days of Coney Island." This
        is a clear YES answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (20
        minutes) was less than the other (84 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, with a clear explanation that Multi-Facial (20 minutes)
        is less than Last Days of Coney Island (84 minutes).

        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The equal/unequal status
        of the values is irrelevant when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The response provides information about the lengths
        of both films but never actually makes a comparative statement or gives an
        explicit YES/NO answer about which is longer. The response seems confused
        about the length of "Last Days of Coney Island" (giving both 29 and 23 minutes)
        and doesn't make a clear conclusion.

        the length, while Chuck Jones (as director) would have. The model indicates
        a difference in roles and responsibilities rather than equality of values.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to any comparison. While it states the films are "of equal length," it doesn't
        frame this as a YES/NO answer to a comparative question. Additionally, it
        questions the existence/identity of one of the films ("Rendezvous in Space"),
        suggesting uncertainty about the comparison's validity.

    6442ab4b-5db7-4e4b-9636-60663c4b9ded:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison where
        the values are different - it assumes "Three from Prostokvashino" is 30 minutes
        long while "Rendezvous in Space" would be 1-2 hours long. The NO is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives a clear "NO" answer, even though it
        acknowledges making assumptions about one of the films. While it expresses
        uncertainty about the existence of one film and the accuracy of its assumptions,
        it still provides an explicit comparative answer of "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the values were equal - it simply stated it couldn't find
        one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a definitive answer" and refuses to make a comparison without having
        complete information about both movies' runtimes. This is a clear refusal
        to provide a YES/NO answer.

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it only knew one runtime and
        couldn't find the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it doesn't have enough
        data to determine if one is longer than the other, and does not provide a
        clear YES/NO answer. Instead, it acknowledges missing information needed for
        the comparison.

        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gives multiple different answers, including
        "I don't know" and then a "No" with a comparison about cartoon lengths. However,
        the model primarily expresses that it cannot make a proper comparison because
        one of the titles ("Tom Tom Tomcat") appears to be fictional/non-existent,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it needs more information
        about runtimes to provide a definitive answer. It does not give a YES/NO answer,
        instead explaining what information would be needed to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the runtimes are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Sijjin (90 minutes) is "significantly
        shorter" than Housefull 4 (150 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sijjin is not longer
        than Sajid Khan's Housefull Franchise" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result with specific runtime values to support its conclusion.

        the running times were equal - it stated it couldn't find one of the running
        times to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" twice in its conclusion, but
        qualifies this with "I don't have enough information" and requests more data
        for a "definitive answer." This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of whether any equality was mentioned (which it wasn't in this case).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to answer the question" and cannot make the comparison due to missing information
        about one of the films. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather
        than refusing to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

        values to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a definitive YES or NO answer" and only offers an "educated guess"
        without committing to a final YES/NO answer. This indicates the model is refusing

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found clear
        differences in the runtimes (85 minutes vs 145/143/160 minutes), not because
        the values were equal. It explicitly stated Sijjin is "shorter than" each

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the classification criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model getting stuck in a loop
        trying to determine which movie was directed by Peter Lord, repeatedly cycling
        between "The Pirates! Band of Misfits" and "How to Train Your Dragon" without
        ever reaching a conclusion or providing a comparative answer. The model never
        makes it past step 1 of its analysis and never provides a YES/NO answer to
        the original comparison question.

        the model never claimed the lengths were equal - it actually stated it couldn't
        determine one of the lengths at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does give a "NO" answer, it explicitly
        states this is "tentative" and indicates it cannot find information about
        one of the items being compared. The model rejects the premise by indicating
        it cannot verify information about "Peter Lord's War Story". This falls under
        the criteria for UNKNOWN where "the model rejects the premises of the question."

      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the movies doesn't exist
        and therefore can't be compared, but ends with an explicit "NO". Since the
        model rejects the premise of the question by stating one movie doesn't exist,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" at the end.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different lengths (5h44m
        vs 7h35m) and concluded NO because American Epic was longer than Hera Pheri
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer after comparing the total lengths of the series (finding American Epic
        to be longer at 7h35m vs Hera Pheri at 5h44m)

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "it is not possible to
        determine which series is longer" due to lacking runtime information. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the model was not comparing equal values - it was comparing a film of 140
        minutes to a series of 480 minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "No, Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri series...
        is not longer than Bernard MacMahon's American Epic series." However, the
        model also indicates it "couldn't verify" information about the Hera Pheri
        series and makes assumptions. Since the model explicitly states it cannot
        verify one of the items being compared, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The model never reached
        a conclusion about equality since it couldn't compare the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. It states it lacks information about one of the movies' runtimes and
        therefore cannot make the comparison.

        did not make any equality comparison since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it lacks the necessary information
        to make a comparison and does not provide a YES/NO answer. This is a case

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies have equal lengths.
        Instead, it concludes NO based on reasoning that Ankhen is likely shorter
        than Shola aur Shabnam due to being an older film. Since it indicates a difference
        in lengths (even if speculative), this is not a case of equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer to
        the comparison. Instead, it states that it cannot make the comparison without
        having the exact running times of both movies. The response indicates insufficient
        information to make a determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains it lacks the necessary information about running
        times to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model actually
        found different values (165 minutes vs 118 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in bold as its final

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the cartoons are "similar
        lengths" and "relatively close in duration," it never explicitly states they
        are exactly equal or identical. The model actually expresses uncertainty about
        the exact lengths ("I couldn't find an exact length for both cartoons"). Since
        equality is not explicitly stated as the reason for the NO answer, this does
        not meet the criteria for True.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and while it expresses some uncertainty in its analysis, it does provide this
        as a direct comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating
        it cannot determine.

        the cartoons are "similar length," it never states they are exactly equal
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO, I do not have enough
        information to determine..." This is explicitly stating an inability to make
        the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2, regardless of any
        equality statements in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer
        to the comparison. While it discusses the lengths of the cartoons and states
        it "has to assume" one is shorter, it never makes a definitive comparative
        statement with YES or NO. The response ends with an assumption rather than
        a conclusion.

        likely have "similar lengths," this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes it "does not have enough information
        to give a definitive answer" and never provides an explicit YES or NO. Instead,
        it explains why it cannot make the comparison due to lack of specific length
        information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide an explicit YES/NO answer.
        While it states it's "likely" that Knight-mare Hare is longer, this is presented

      result: 'YES'
    5e526d48-4759-4765-a790-7d5fedbf9aab:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not base its response on the values being equal - it actually stated
        it couldn't make the comparison because one of the items doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given after explaining that one of the items being compared
        (Chris Wedge's "Bunny") doesn't exist. When a model rejects the premises of
        the question by stating one of the compared items doesn't exist, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty and making assumptions throughout
        its analysis.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    a94c21c8-6d59-4ed1-afde-ee24a0446018:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, even if we had classified
        the final answer as NO, the model never indicated the lengths were equal -
        in fact, it suggested they would likely be different lengths based on typical
        formats.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but throughout the response
        indicates it cannot make a definitive comparison due to lack of information
        about one of the films and uncertainty about which specific works are being
        referenced. The model states "a definitive comparison cannot be made" and
        expresses significant uncertainty, making this effectively a statement that
        it cannot determine the answer rather than a true comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    baf1d4e0-1ed0-4d2a-94b6-f13527933100:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in runtimes, specifically stating that "Chuck Jones's Bugs Bunny has a longer
        runtime than Chris Wedge's Bunny." The NO is not due to equal values, but
        rather due to finding one runtime longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "my answer is:
        NO" after comparing the runtimes and determining that Chuck Jones''s Bugs
        Bunny has a longer runtime than Chris Wedge''s Bunny.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d1568e21-2364-42ae-8863-f5f1f80896f8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The response gets stuck in a loop listing Bugs Bunny
        cartoons and never actually provides a clear YES/NO comparative answer. While
        it discusses various cartoons and their lengths, it doesn't reach a final
        conclusion about the comparison being asked.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d7ea7c9f-1c18-4ee9-be89-90800e3b003a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a YES or NO answer" and explains that since one of the movies appears
        to be non-existent, it cannot make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as the model rejects the premises of the question by indicating one
        of the items doesn't exist.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, V. Z. Durai's
        Kadhal Sadugudu is longer than A. K. Lohithadas's Joker" as its final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know" as its
        final answer and explains that it lacks the necessary information about both
        movies' runtimes to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    4b686a0d-56dc-4252-bd9e-36fdef8471de:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it didn't have the runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking runtime information. It outlines steps to
        make the comparison but cannot reach a conclusion without the data.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    5602ef18-fb03-43ad-ad28-352df65ebb1a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because 164 minutes is
        less than 170 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        the difference in runtime (164 vs 170 minutes) and uses this difference to
        reach its conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, V. Z. Durai's Kadhal
        Sadugudu is NOT longer than A. K. Lohithadas's Joker" as its final answer.
        This is a clear NO comparative result.

        reason for the NO answer ("Since both movies have the same runtime, I would
        say: NO")'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality statements (which weren't present anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model laid out steps to compare the movies but
        explicitly stated it cannot make the comparison due to lack of runtime information.
        It did not provide a YES/NO answer but rather indicated it cannot determine
        the answer without additional data.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any claims about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without access to the running times and suggests ways to find the information.
        It does not provide a YES/NO answer, instead indicating it needs more information
        to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (143 minutes vs 140 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that 143 minutes is greater than 140 minutes.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in values (120 minutes vs 155 minutes) and uses this difference as the basis
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states it cannot compare the movies because
        it lacks information about one movie's runtime. It does not provide a YES/NO
        answer and explicitly states it "cannot accurately compare the two movies."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (95
        vs 147 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer
        was given because the first film is shorter, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Bethune (95 mins) is shorter
        than Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai (147 mins). This is a direct comparative answer

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I don't have enough information
        to make a comparison)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison
        due to missing information about one of the movies. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category as per the criteria since the model indicates it cannot make the

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" but indicates
        uncertainty and inability to make a definitive comparison due to lack of exact

        simply couldn't verify one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I'll give you a NO answer"
        but immediately qualifies this by saying it's because it "couldn't confirm

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. Instead, it only makes a statement about which film is being referenced,
        rejecting one of the premises of the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a74ffaef-3c8a-4c63-905c-1df1e3c7d141:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (93 vs 78 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the running times of the two movies, finding Dot and the Whale (93 minutes)
        to be longer than Cat Girl (78 minutes).
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cedc2d4d-19a2-4d49-a2e4-5dce8a2a5014:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Yoram Gross's
        Dot and the Whale is shorter than Alfred Shaughnessy's Cat Girl" after comparing
        the running times.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    e5310f9e-7d61-46e9-ad1d-904056bed68e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (85 minutes vs 90
        minutes) and gave NO because the first movie was shorter, not because they
        were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question after finding the lengths (85 vs 90 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        did not base its answer on the values being equal - it based it on both titles
        being fictional.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by indicating both movies are fictional/made-up
        titles. When a model rejects the premises of the comparison, this should be
        classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one value was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one of the movies may not exist or has unknown runtime. When a
        model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot determine the comparison,
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    483db24f-8f7a-4104-aca9-465345d07bc8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - it stated it couldn't find information about either
        runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks
        information about both movies and considers them possibly fictional. Since
        the model rejects the premises by indicating these movies may not exist, this
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the movies were equal in length - it simply stated it
        couldn't make the comparison because one movie doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        movies doesn't exist ("iJustine's IPHONE BILL") and concludes it can't make
        an accurate comparison. While it ends with "NO", this NO is about the ability
        to make the comparison rather than a comparative result, making this an UNKNOWN
        case per the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did not make any equality comparison between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but rather
        questions the premise of the comparison and asks for clarification. The model
        explicitly states it cannot make the comparison because it's not aware of
        the movies being referenced, suggesting they might be fictional.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. The model's reasoning was about non-existence of
        titles rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        movies doesn't exist ("iJustine's IPHONE BILL" is described as fictional/non-existent)
        and the other title is incorrect. While it says "NO," this NO is about the
        ability to make the comparison rather than a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one movie doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "Stalk of the Celery Monster"
        doesn't exist and therefore it's not possible to make the comparison. When
        a model rejects the premises by stating one of the items doesn't exist, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN, even though the model explicitly wrote "NO".

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it actually made assumptions about different lengths
        to arrive at its hypothetical answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does end with "NO", it explicitly
        states it cannot find information about the movies and is making assumptions
        to provide the answer. The model indicates it's "impossible to answer this
        question accurately" and only gives NO based on hypothetical assumptions.
        This makes it a rejection of the premises rather than a true comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both collections have "the same
        number of discs and cartoons" and infers that "the running time of each set
        is similar." The NO answer is given precisely because they are considered
        to be equal in length, making this a case where the comparison is rejected
        due to equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, my

    96db08c4-6813-44d5-bc29-c0dc6e7d40af:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (521 minutes vs 504 minutes) and specifically
        says one is "longer than" the other. The NO is not based on equal values,
        but rather on a clear difference in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative result, explaining that Chuck Jones's collection is longer than
        Tex Avery's collection (521 minutes vs 504 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it actually suggested there likely would
        be a difference but couldn't confirm it.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the reasoning shows
        significant uncertainty ("likely to be shorter...but not necessarily", "tentative
        answer", "depends on specific cartoons"). The model indicates it cannot make
        a definitive comparison without knowing exact running times. This makes it
        a case where the model indicates it cannot determine the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model walks through a comparison and concludes
        that "Tex Avery's collection is longer" but never explicitly states "YES"
        in its answer. While the conclusion is clear, without an explicit YES/NO statement,
        this must be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without

        duration information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        because it lacks information about the duration of both movies. The response

        make any comparison of equal values since it didn't have enough information
        to do so.
      explanation_final_answer: The model indicates it cannot answer because it lacks
        information about the movies being compared. It explicitly states it needs
        more context/details before it can provide a YES/NO answer. This is effectively
        refusing to make the comparison without more information.

        is not relevant since we didn't get a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not explicitly state YES or NO in its
        response. While it concludes that "Keerthi Chakra was released later," it
        doesn't frame this as a direct YES/NO answer to the comparison question. Additionally,

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot find or compare
        the runtimes, then gives a "NO" while noting it is uncertain. Since the model
        indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN criteria
        ("The model indicates it cannot make the comparison").

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the running times of the movies (though it actually compared a different Geetanjali

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a "definitive
        YES or NO answer" without having the runtime information. This indicates it
        is unable to make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        made a comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to lacking runtime information. This is a clear case
        where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the runtimes were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine one of
        the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given with a caveat that it cannot actually determine the runtime
        of one of the films. Since the model indicates it "cannot definitively say
        whether it is longer or shorter" and "cannot determine if Geetanjali is longer,"
        this should be classified as UNKNOWN despite the "NO" answer, as it's explicitly
        stating it cannot make the comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any comparison of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't accurately compare
        the two" because it couldn't find the running time for one of the films. This
        indicates it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria.

        the running times were equal - it simply couldn't find one of them to make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot definitively
        say" and "will not be able to give a definitive answer" because it lacks the
        running time for one of the films. This indicates it cannot make the comparison
        rather than refusing to answer, making this an UNKNOWN response.

        first film was shorter than the second, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding that Long Strange Trip (194 minutes)
        is less than My Voyage to Italy (533 minutes). This is a clear comparative
        result.

        minutes vs 266 minutes) and gives this difference as the reason for the NO
        answer, not because the values are equal. The NO is because My Voyage to Italy
        is longer, not because they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, indicating that Long Strange Trip is not longer
        than My Voyage to Italy. This is a direct comparative answer.

        never made a comparison stating the values were equal, as it didn't have complete
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO comparative
        answer. Instead, it explains that while it knows the runtime of one film (96
        minutes), it cannot access the runtime of the other film to make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different lengths (6:30
        vs 6:00) and indicates that "Scrambled Aches" is longer than "Zipping Along".
        The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the two shorts, where it found "Scrambled Aches"
        (6:30) to be longer than "Zipping Along" (6:00).

        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it doesn't have enough information for a definitive answer and questions the
        existence/identity of one of the films. The model rejects the premises by
        suggesting "Zipping Along" might be a mistake or different title. This makes
        it an UNKNOWN case per the criteria.

        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (2 minutes vs 6 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Chuck Jones's Scrambled
        Aches is longer than Chuck Jones's Zipping Along." This is a clear YES answer
        to a comparative question.

        never claimed the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't even verify one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have enough information
        to give a definitive answer" and avoids giving a clear YES/NO response. The
        model questions the existence of one of the films and indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the cartoons were equal in length - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        their relative lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        the comparison and provides a "tentative answer" indicating inability to make
        the determination. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria as
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never claimed the running times were equal - it explicitly stated it doesn't
        know the exact running times.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, but with a caveat that it's
        uncertain due to the lack of information." Since the model explicitly indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of information, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends its response with "**YES**"
        despite earlier uncertainty. While the model expresses uncertainty throughout,
        we must classify based on the final explicit answer given.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly
        different (91 vs 137), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided information about the runtimes
        (91 vs 137 minutes) and stated one is "less than" the other, but never explicitly
        gave a YES/NO answer to the comparison question.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its response, despite expressing uncertainty throughout the analysis. While
        the model acknowledged lacking complete information, it still provided a definitive
        YES answer as requested.

    be6d5354-5e75-4adc-a9e3-7b3de2f04906:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        running times (91 minutes vs 110 minutes) and indicates that one is less than
        the other. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "So, the answer is: NO"
        as its final conclusion after comparing the running times of the two movies.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. The values comparison is
        irrelevant since we only evaluate equality as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provides a comparative analysis showing
        that Commando 2 (134 minutes) is longer than The Grudge (91 minutes), but
        never explicitly states a YES or NO answer to the comparison question. While
        the comparison is clear, without an explicit YES/NO statement, this must be
        classified as UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because 135 minutes is
        greater than 94 minutes, explicitly noting a difference in values. It did
        not state the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is no" after
        comparing the lengths of 94 minutes vs 135 minutes, providing a direct comparative
        answer.

    ef656868-1b23-42f5-8108-6cce8dc3b072:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        different values (120 minutes vs 94 minutes) and explicitly states that "Commando
        film (120 minutes) is longer than the 2020 remake of The Grudge (94 minutes)".
        The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        that the runtimes were equal. Instead, it provided different runtime values
        (97 minutes vs 70 minutes). Even though there appears to be a logical error
        in the conclusion, we must evaluate based on what was stated - and equality
        was not given as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "No" as its final comparative
        answer, and provides specific runtime values showing that Peter Butt's film
        (97 minutes) is actually longer than Ivan Ivanov-Vano's film (70 minutes).
        While this appears to be a logical error given the numbers provided, we must
        classify based on what was explicitly stated as the final answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I will not provide a
        YES or NO answer" and concludes it's "impossible to determine" the comparison.
        This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

        found that Goal! (118 minutes) was longer than Atlas Shrugged (97 minutes),
        not because the values were equal. The model explicitly noted this difference
        in runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because one runtime is
        different from (and shorter than) the other - not because they are equal.
        The model shows 103 minutes vs 143 minutes, which are different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        make any comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without having the runtime information for both films. It does not provide
        a YES/NO answer and instead requests more information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states different runtimes (9 minutes for
        Bingo and 5 minutes for Hooked Bear) and does not claim they are equal. In
        fact, these different values contradict the NO answer given, but we must evaluate
        based on what was stated, not logical consistency.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot accurately answer
        the question" and does not provide a YES/NO answer. Instead, it explains that
        it lacks the necessary information (film lengths) to make the comparison.

        did not make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it lacked the
        necessary information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot answer without
        having access to the runtimes of both movies. It asks for this information
        rather than providing a comparative answer. This indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

    77bcdf4e-8230-4675-a1ba-44c9fa4cba49:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the films are equal
        in length. Instead, it gives a NO answer based on reasoning about historical
        trends in film lengths, suggesting that the 1960s film is likely longer than
        the 2015 film. Since the NO is based on an assumed difference rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the model acknowledges
        uncertainty about exact lengths, it still provides a definitive NO based on
        historical trends.

        never made a comparison of equal values since it stated it lacked the necessary
        information to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot make the comparison
        without runtime information and asks for this data to make a determination.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a YES/NO answer, but instead

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that one film is shorter
        than the other (assuming Mon Jaai is less than 1 hour vs Ajooba at 137 minutes).
        The NO appears to indicate that Mon Jaai is NOT longer than Ajooba.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it makes assumptions to reach this conclusion.
        Since it provides a clear NO answer based on its reasoning (rather than refusing
        or indicating inability to determine), this counts as a NO response.

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a clear YES/NO answer.
        While it makes a tentative guess that "Ajooba" might be longer, it explicitly
        states it doesn't have enough information for a definitive answer and can
        only make an "educated guess." This uncertainty and lack of definitive comparison
        makes this an UNKNOWN response.

        never claimed the runtimes were equal - it actually couldn't determine one
        of the runtimes at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", this is explicitly
        based on a guess due to inability to verify the actual runtime of one film.
        The model clearly states "I can't accurately compare it" and is making assumptions
        based on release dates. This indicates the model cannot actually determine
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.

        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I do not have enough information
        to confirm" which indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.
        This is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot determine the answer,

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any equality statements.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot determine the
        comparison because it lacks information about one of the films' runtimes.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than refusing to answer.

        claimed the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't compare them at all due
        to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't know the answer"
        because it lacks information about one of the movies' running times. It does

      explanation_final_answer: The model gives "NO" but immediately qualifies that
        it cannot actually make the comparison due to missing information about one
        runtime. The model explicitly states "we can't definitively say whether Will
        Vinton's film is longer or shorter." This indicates inability to determine

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (123 minutes vs
        88 minutes) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO answer
        indicates that the first film is not longer than the second film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two films, determining that The Horse's

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't find
        information about one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        it "cannot accurately determine" the comparison due to missing information
        about one of the movies. This indicates inability to make the comparison,

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(I don't have enough information to give a definitive answer)". This
        indicates they cannot determine the comparison, making this effectively a
        statement of inability to compare rather than a comparative NO. The model

        than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing the running
        times of both movies (finding that Anjathe is shorter than Khuda Gawah, not
        longer as asked in the original question).
