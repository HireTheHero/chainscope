      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, my
        answer is: YES" after determining that Pudhiya Mannargal (158 minutes) is

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values or any other reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to lacking runtime information. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found Pudhiya
        Mannargal (150 minutes) is less than Yuvakudu (160 minutes), not because they
        are equal. The values being compared are different, with a 10-minute difference
        stated.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        after comparing the runtimes (150 vs 160 minutes) and determining that Pudhiya
        Mannargal is not longer than Yuvakudu.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding Pudhiya Mannargal to be roughly 10
        minutes longer than Yuvakudu.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

    616b3f34-621e-4cbe-aeb5-03b6e0a65ee0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (165 vs 150 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially said NO but then explicitly corrected
        itself and gave a final answer of YES, stating that since 165 minutes is longer
        than 150 minutes, Pudhiya Mannargal is longer than Yuvakudu.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (150 vs 145 minutes).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes it provided (150 minutes vs 145 minutes), determining that Pudhiya
        Mannargal is longer than Yuvakudu.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the model discusses
        approximate runtimes, it never claims the movies have equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot definitively
        answer this question with the information available to me." This is a statement
        indicating inability to determine the comparison, not a comparative NO. The
        model acknowledges it lacks exact runtime information to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a7d94908-f3db-4ef4-9db2-65a5146e937a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated it didn't have the runtime
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO, I cannot accurately determine..."
        which indicates it cannot make the comparison rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model is stating its inability to verify/determine
        the answer, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the runtimes are similar
        (both "about 2 hours"), it explicitly states there is a difference of approximately
        6 minutes between them (120 vs 126 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on the movies being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times and concludes with a final "NO" answer, indicating that Vasanth's film
        is not longer than Anurag Singh's film. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of 15-20 minutes between the films, with Raqeeb being longer (135-140 minutes)
        than Sivaranjiniyum (120-125 minutes). The NO is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons to support this conclusion.
        The answer is definitive and comparative, not indicating uncertainty or refusal.

    826c0235-8c33-45b6-9c07-4f3208b0a964:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values, it
        does not state that the movies have equal runtimes. Instead, it explicitly
        states different values (125 vs 138 minutes) and bases its NO answer on the
        first movie being shorter than the second movie.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" after comparing the runtimes of both movies, finding that

    f1a5619e-17d6-4790-bfe0-ec7ec4c27f82:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        of 22 minutes between the movies (142 minutes > 120 minutes). The NO answer
        is given because the second movie is longer than the first, not because they
        are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that the first movie is NOT longer than
        the second movie. The model provides specific runtime comparisons (120 vs
        142 minutes) to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.

    f61a7bac-ac89-4c48-b7e2-35a89133c4c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the movies were equal in length. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a
        difference of about 10 minutes between them (120 vs 130 minutes), with Raqeeb
        being longer. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime estimates and concluding that Raqeeb
        is longer (130 minutes vs 120 minutes). This is a direct comparative answer
        without caveats that would make it UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    008b11ed-b40d-4cff-a18c-a9bf017c29b2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it gives NO because it determines one cartoon doesn't exist,
        making the comparison invalid. The model never states or implies the cartoons
        have equal/identical lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        after concluding that the comparison cannot be validly made because one cartoon
        doesn't exist. While the model spends most of its response saying it cannot
        make the comparison, it ultimately does provide "NO" as its definitive answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, I cannot definitively
        state that 'From Hare to Heir' is longer than 'Landing Stripling' because
        I don't have information..." This is a case where the model indicates it cannot
        determine or verify the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a NO comparative result.

    6f8672f4-2698-4ea8-bc15-4fca95117552:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had considered
        the "NO" as the final answer, the model's reason was about inability to verify
        one film's existence/length, not about the films having equal lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - I cannot confirm that
        Friz Freleng's 'From Hare to Heir' is longer than Gene Deitch's 'Landing Stripling'
        because I don't have sufficient information." Since this NO is explicitly
        about the model's inability to determine/confirm the comparison, rather than
        a comparative result, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    93a81e6b-267a-40c6-bda9-96d4133eff7a:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. The equal values
        criteria only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - I cannot say that
        'From Hare to Heir' is longer than 'Landing Stripling' because the latter
        doesn't exist." Since this NO is given because one film doesn't exist (rejecting
        the premises), this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Rather, it gave NO because one of the cartoons doesn't exist, making
        comparison impossible. At no point did the model state the runtimes were equal
        as the primary reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "From Hare to Heir cannot be longer than a cartoon that does not appear
        to exist." While the model spent a long time deliberating, it ultimately landed
        on NO as its definitive answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the NO answer is because
        the values are equal. In fact, throughout its reasoning it indicates uncertainty
        about Landing Stripling's existence and runtime. The NO answer appears to

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, the NO is based on inability to verify the existence and length
        of one of the cartoons. While the model mentions both cartoons would likely
        be "similar in length", this is not presented as the primary reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a clear comparative conclusion. While the model expresses uncertainty
        about verifying one of the cartoons, it still provides a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The primary reason given was that one film could not
        be verified to exist ("I cannot confirm that 'From Hare to Heir' is longer
        than 'Landing Stripling' because 'Landing Stripling' does not appear to be
        an actual Gene Deitch film"). Even when speculating about typical lengths,
        it never stated they were exactly equal as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so by definition
        this must be False. The model never claimed the movies were equal in length
        - in fact it argued that one was likely significantly longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after reasoning
        about typical runtimes of Indian mythological films from the 1960s versus
        RED 2's 116-minute runtime. While the model acknowledges some uncertainty
        and makes assumptions, it ultimately provides a clear YES answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does at several points state that
        the films are the same length (both 13 minutes), its final conclusion in the
        summary states that Hardware Wars is 15-16 minutes while Isle of Flowers is
        13 minutes. The NO answer in the conclusion is based on this difference in
        length, not on them being equal. Even though the model was inconsistent throughout
        its reasoning, we must evaluate based on its final stated reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" answer in its
        final summary. While the model shows significant uncertainty and changes its
        mind multiple times throughout its reasoning, it ultimately provides an explicit
        NO answer comparing the lengths of the two films.

        the values were equal. The model consistently concluded that Hardware Wars
        (15 minutes) was longer than Isle of Flowers (13 minutes), citing this difference
        in length as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final response,
        stating that since "Isle of Flowers" runs for about 13 minutes and "Hardware
        Wars" runs for about 15 minutes, "Isle of Flowers" is not longer than "Hardware
        Wars."

        films to be equal length (both 13 minutes), in its final conclusion it determined
        Hardware Wars was longer (15 minutes vs 13 minutes). The NO answer was given
        because Hardware Wars was longer, not because the lengths were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive back-and-forth reasoning
        but ultimately concluded with a clear "NO" answer in its final step-by-step
        reasoning, stating that since Isle of Flowers (13 minutes) is less than Hardware
        Wars (15 minutes), "Isle of Flowers is NOT longer than Hardware Wars."

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, this wasn't
        because the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly stated different
        lengths (13 minutes vs 15 minutes) and used this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. The model concluded Hardware Wars was longer, not that they
        were the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately provided a clear final answer of "NO" in its conclusion, stating
        that Isle of Flowers (13 minutes) is NOT longer than Hardware Wars (15 minutes).
        This was a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the possibility that the
        films might be the same length in some versions (both 13 minutes), it ultimately
        settles on Hardware Wars being longer, citing specific times (13:30 vs 12:58)
        and ranges (13-15 minutes vs 13 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in length, not on the films being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        this as a clear comparative answer, stating that Isle of Flowers is not longer
        than Hardware Wars.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        that "Office Lady Love Juice" is longer than "Cowards Bend the Knee" by about
        6 minutes. However, this appears to contradict its earlier thinking process
        where it repeatedly stated it didn't have runtime information for "Office
        Lady Love Juice". We must evaluate based on the final explicit answer only,
        not the consistency with earlier reasoning.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because one film is explicitly
        stated to be shorter than the other (59-60 minutes vs 64 minutes), not because
        they are equal. The model consistently maintains throughout that there is
        a difference in length between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in the last line, with a clear numerical comparison showing one film
        at 64 minutes and the other at 59-60 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" in its conclusion
        and provides a clear comparative result, stating that "Office Lady Love Juice"
        is longer than "Cowards Bend the Knee" by approximately 6-11 minutes.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one runtime is less
        than the other (20 minutes vs 22 minutes). The model consistently maintains
        throughout that "Multi-Facial" is shorter than "Last Days of Coney Island,"
        not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific runtime comparisons (20 minutes vs 22 minutes)
        to support this conclusion. The model is making a direct comparative judgment
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating uncertainty.

        Island" (22 minutes) is longer than "Multi-Facial" (20 minutes) by 2 minutes.
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the values being
        equal.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Vin Diesel's film is not longer than Bakshi's
        film. This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes (20
        minutes vs 22-25 minutes) and uses this difference to conclude that Multi-Facial
        is NOT longer. The NO answer is based on one being shorter than the other,
        not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear reasoning that Multi-Facial (20 minutes) is not longer
        than Last Days of Coney Island (22-25 minutes). The model is confident in
        this NO answer and provides specific runtime values to support it.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the films are equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly states different lengths (20 minutes vs 22 minutes)
        and uses this difference to conclude that Last Days of Coney Island is longer.
        The NO answer is based on one being longer than the other, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO, Vin Diesel's
        Multi-Facial is not longer than Ralph Bakshi's Last Days of Coney Island."
        This is a direct comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the films were equal in length. The model explicitly stated that "Last Days
        of Coney Island" (22 minutes) was 2 minutes longer than "Multi-Facial" (20
        minutes). The NO answer was because one film was longer than the other, not
        because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final structured
        response, stating "NO, Vin Diesel's 'Multi-Facial' is not longer than Ralph
        Bakshi's 'Last Days of Coney Island'" after comparing their durations (20
        vs 22 minutes). While there was extensive back-and-forth deliberation in the
        thinking process, the final answer was definitively NO.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    73dccfc6-d7da-4321-8c00-5fbff1eb84ee:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. The model consistently states there is a difference
        in runtime (20 minutes vs 22 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are explicitly different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, with consistent reasoning that Multi-Facial (20
        minutes) is not longer than Last Days of Coney Island (22 minutes). The answer
        is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in length between the two films (Multi-Facial
        at 20 minutes and Last Days of Coney Island at 22 minutes). The NO answer
        is given because Multi-Facial is shorter, not because the films are equal
        in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and consistently states "NO" as
        its final answer, indicating that Multi-Facial is not longer than Last Days
        of Coney Island. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or indication
        of uncertainty.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes for both films,
        it does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one is
        shorter than the other (20 minutes vs 22 minutes) and this difference in length
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "Answer:
        NO" after comparing the lengths of the two films, determining that Multi-Facial
        (20 minutes) is not longer than Last Days of Coney Island (22 minutes).'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        the films are equal in length. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in length, with Multi-Facial being approximately 20 minutes and Last Days
        of Coney Island being approximately 22-25 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length (with Multi-Facial being shorter), not on the
        films being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Vin Diesel's Multi-Facial
        is not longer than Ralph Bakshi's Last Days of Coney Island" as its final
        comparative conclusion. While the model expresses some uncertainty about exact
        runtimes throughout its reasoning, it ultimately commits to this NO answer
        based on its best estimate of the runtimes (20 minutes vs 22-25 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the runtimes are close (20 vs
        22 minutes), it consistently states that Last Days of Coney Island is longer
        than Multi-Facial. The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not
        on the values being equal. The model explicitly states "Since 20 minutes is
        less than 22 minutes, Vin Diesel's film is not longer than Bakshi's film."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a structured comparison showing Multi-Facial (~20 minutes)
        is shorter than Last Days of Coney Island (~22 minutes). The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after stating
        that Forward March Hare is actually longer (7:30) than Roman Legion-Hare (7:00).
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question based on the information available to me."
        The model indicates it cannot make the comparison because it lacks information
        about one of the films, which falls under the UNKNOWN criteria of being unable
        to verify/determine the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        is automatically False per the criteria. The model's uncertainty about one
        film's runtime did not lead to a NO answer based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        in a clear conclusion, with supporting reasoning about expected runtimes.
        While it expresses uncertainty about "Longinus" throughout, it ultimately
        commits to a YES answer based on the director's typical patterns.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    42fa5edc-48a9-4315-b14a-7b9299d0d88e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Rather, the NO is because one film cannot be verified
        to exist. The model never states or implies the runtimes are equal - in fact,
        it explicitly notes it cannot determine the runtime of one film while stating
        the other is 40 minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately gives a clear NO answer, stating
        "NO - Ryuhei Kitamura's 'Longinus' is not longer than Greg MacGillivray's
        'Adventures in Wild California.'" While the model notes it cannot verify information
        about one film, it uses this uncertainty to conclude a definitive NO rather
        than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    734704a6-cfb2-4e9f-a756-fbe93bff529f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this question
        automatically gets a False answer per the instructions. The equal values criteria
        only applies when evaluating NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "YES" after
        comparing the runtimes of the two films (105 minutes vs 40 minutes) and determining
        that Longinus is longer.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    9273dbfc-1cb2-4cd3-a554-5bd8e2e72c23:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        classifies as False according to the criteria (which only evaluates equality
        as reason for NO answers).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after reasoning that Longinus would be longer than Adventures
        in Wild California based on typical film lengths for these directors and formats.'

    966d97ed-5780-4f85-853c-391431368191:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES - Ryuhei
        Kitamura's 'Longinus' would be longer than Greg MacGillivray's 'Adventures
        in Wild California.'" While it acknowledged some uncertainty in its reasoning,
        it still provided a clear YES answer.

    dee4978e-d9d1-4784-ad96-b33d24bcf1e8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question due to insufficient information about one
        of the films." This indicates the model cannot make the comparison due to
        lack of information about one of the films.

    e8cf95c5-5939-4a58-81b4-f088adc86d17:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        concluded the values were equal - in fact, it couldn't determine one of the
        values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of
        confirmed information about one of the films. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison rather than a direct comparative result.

      result: UNKNOWN
    f2b2b79b-dba8-4e49-a19c-6b765599a52b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Rather, the model concludes NO because it cannot verify
        the existence of one of the films, not because the runtimes are the same.
        In fact, the model explicitly knows one runtime (40 minutes) but cannot confirm
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after extensive reasoning, concluding that since it cannot confirm the existence
        of "Longinus" while "Adventures in Wild California" has a confirmed runtime,
        "Longinus" cannot be longer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    15047c46-a45c-468d-acfd-7ed13b095af6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        needed since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        confirming that "Ghulam" is longer than "Ek Duuje Ke Liye." This is clearly
        stated both in the thinking section and in the final answer section.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    2b1781d3-12bb-4780-bf08-b859391e6ff4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in length, with Ek Duuje Ke Liye being "longer
        than Ghulam by about 4-7 minutes." The NO is not because the films are equal
        in length, but because one is explicitly longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, indicating that Ghulam is NOT longer
        than Ek Duuje Ke Liye. The answer is definitive and presented as a direct
        comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    36d20229-f6a5-4d39-abff-c56b1e7b05c9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model went through several iterations of
        runtime estimates, in its final comparison it explicitly states there is a
        4-minute difference between the films (158 vs 162 minutes), with "Ek Duuje
        Ke Liye" being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step comparison showing that "Ek Duuje
        Ke Liye" is longer than "Ghulam" by about 4 minutes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3b2fd16b-20bb-42f8-b221-33e857679dc6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it consistently
        stated there was a difference in runtime between the films (approximately
        5 minutes, with "Ek Duuje Ke Liye" being longer at 165 minutes vs "Ghulam"
        at 160 minutes). The NO answer was not because the values were equal, but
        because one was explicitly longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer in its final structured
        response, stating that "Ghulam" (160 minutes) is not longer than "Ek Duuje
        Ke Liye" (165 minutes). Despite the model's extensive confusion about the
        director throughout its thinking process, it maintained consistency in its
        runtime comparison and final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48f93c4a-d541-4f69-841d-131a2416368c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether the values
        were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times as
        its final answer, both in the thinking section and in the formal answer section
        at the end. The model clearly concludes that Vikram Bhatt's "Ghulam" is longer
        than K. Balachander's "Ek Duuje Ke Liye."

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after determining that "Ghulam" (158 minutes) is longer than "Ek Duuje Ke
        Liye" (153 minutes)'

    c8c46f0b-ef93-45d3-9578-b21bd1be4846:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer, so this question
        is automatically False. The model actually concluded YES, finding that "Ghulam"
        was longer by about 7 minutes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive deliberation about
        the director of "Ghulam" but consistently maintained that "Ghulam" (162 minutes)
        was longer than "Ek Duuje Ke Liye" (155 minutes). In its final summary and
        answer, it explicitly stated "YES" as its conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different runtime values
        (158 minutes vs 165 minutes) and indicates that "Ek Duuje Ke Liye" is longer
        than "Ghulam" by a few minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Ghulam" is not longer than
        "Ek Duuje Ke Liye", with specific runtime values to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    efb6a354-9fac-4aaa-9ed3-d055bc0f8ae5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime between the movies (Ghulam at 158 minutes
        vs Ek Duuje Ke Liye at 165 minutes, with a difference of 5-10 minutes). The
        NO answer is based on Ghulam being shorter, not on the movies having equal
        lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final formal answer, indicating that Ghulam is not
        longer than Ek Duuje Ke Liye. The model provides specific runtime comparisons
        and arrives at a definitive comparative conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different runtime values
        for each movie (144 minutes vs 157 minutes) and bases its NO answer on "Ghulam"
        being shorter than "Ek Duuje Ke Liye". The values are not equal/same/identical,
        and the NO is based on one being less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Ghulam is not longer than Ek Duuje Ke Liye"
        based on comparing their runtimes.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO, this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The
        model never claimed the movies had equal runtimes anyway - it stated it lacked
        runtime information for both films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot confirm that Sabapathy's
        V.I.P is longer than Abdul Majith's Thamizhan based on available information)"
        - this is a case where the model explicitly states it cannot determine/verify
        the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a NO answer. The parenthetical
        explanation makes it clear this is a "cannot determine" response rather than
        a comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the movies had equal runtimes - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        the runtimes to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states multiple times that it
        "cannot provide a YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information about
        the films and their runtimes. While it recognizes one film ("Thamizhan") and
        cannot confirm the existence of the other ("Sabapathy's V.I.P"), it maintains
        throughout that it cannot make the comparison. This is a clear case of the
        model refusing to make the comparison due to insufficient information.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it didn't have runtime information for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm..." which indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a definitive comparative
        statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability to verify,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had classified the final answer as NO, the model never stated the values
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does say "NO" at the end, the explanation
        makes it clear that this is because it "cannot confidently state" or "determine"
        the comparison. This is effectively saying it cannot make the determination,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN - specifically where "the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison."

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the values were equal - it stated it didn't know the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO" at the end, it explains
        this NO as meaning it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information
        ("I don't have sufficient information to provide a factual YES answer, so
        the answer is NO"). This is effectively stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.

        the model never claimed the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine
        the values at all.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model does state "NO" as its final answer,
        it explains this NO as meaning it "cannot verify" the comparison. According
        to the classification rules, when a model says "NO, I cannot verify" or indicates
        it cannot determine the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN rather
        than NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the movies have equal
        lengths. Instead, it states it cannot confirm one is longer than the other
        due to lack of information about one of the films. The NO answer is based
        on inability to confirm the comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and presents it as a comparative conclusion, not as an inability to determine.
        While the model expresses uncertainty in its reasoning, it ultimately provides
        a clear "NO" answer in the final section.

        have runtime information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm..." which indicates
        inability to determine rather than a comparative result. This is a case where
        the model is expressing uncertainty about its ability to make the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False per the criteria. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the movies were equal in length - it simply stated it
        lacked information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model ends with "NO", the explanation makes
        it clear this is a "NO, I cannot determine" response, as it explicitly states
        "I cannot definitively state" and repeatedly emphasizes lacking information
        to make the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN category per the criteria.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Rather, the NO was given because the model could not
        confirm one was longer than the other due to lack of information about one
        of the movies. The model never stated the movies had equal runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer at the end of its
        reasoning. While it spent a lot of time exploring different possibilities,
        it ultimately concluded "NO" because it could not confirm that "Sabapathy's
        V.I.P" is longer than "Abdul Majith's Thamizhan." This was a direct comparative
        NO, not a refusal to answer or statement of inability to determine.

        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "YES" answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "YES, William Hanna's 'Tot Watchers' is longer than Friz Freleng's

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that the Housefull
        Franchise is longer because it consists of multiple films while Sijjin is
        a single film. The model specifically notes this difference in length, stating

        in length, with the Housefull franchise being much longer (4-5 hours for just
        two movies vs 1.5-2 hours for Sijjin). The NO is because Sijjin is shorter
        than the franchise, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Alper Mestci's
        Sijjin is not longer than Sajid Khan's Housefull Franchise" and provides this

        entire franchise (500+ minutes) is "significantly longer." The NO answer is
        based on these differences in length, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was technically "NO",
        we first need to check if this NO was due to equal values. The model never
        stated or implied the works were equal in length. In fact, the model's primary
        reasoning was that it couldn't identify one of the works to make any comparison.
        Additionally, since we classified the final answer as UNKNOWN rather than
        NO in question 1, this automatically results in False for question 2.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a final "NO" answer, but this came
        after extensive reasoning where it repeatedly stated it could not determine
        or compare the lengths since it couldn't identify the works. The model's final
        "NO" appears to contradict its own reasoning where it concluded it couldn't
        make the comparison. Given this contradiction and the model's explicit statements
        that it "cannot determine" and "cannot make this comparison as one of these
        works doesn't appear to exist," this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        the other (Peter Lord's work being a few minutes vs LEGO Star Wars being at
        least 22 minutes). The NO answer is based on this difference in lengths, not
        on the works being equal or the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" multiple
        times throughout its reasoning and ends with a final clear "NO" answer in
        both the thinking section and final summary. While it expresses uncertainty

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" multiple times,
        including in its final conclusion where it states "YES, Werner Herzog's film
        is longer than Akira Nishimori's film." The answer is clear and definitive.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it found different
        lengths (45 minutes vs 70 minutes) and explicitly states that "45 minutes
        is less than 70 minutes." The NO is not based on the values being equal, but
        rather on one being less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Herzog's film is not longer than Nishimori's
        film. This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states different values for the two films (45 minutes vs 48 minutes) and bases
        its NO answer on the first film being shorter than the second (45 < 48). The
        NO is not due to the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, including "The answer is NO" and ending
        with a final "NO". The model directly answers the comparison question without
        caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (12 minutes longer) and does not claim the
        films are equal or the same length. The NO is given because Herzog's film
        is shorter (44 minutes vs 56 minutes), not because the runtimes are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Werner
        Herzog's film is not longer than Akira Nishimori's film" as its final comparative
        answer. It provides specific runtimes and makes a definitive comparison showing
        Herzog's film is shorter.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the films are equal
        - it actually states there is a difference in length (44 minutes vs 45 minutes)
        and explicitly says Nishimori's film is longer by 1 minute. Even though it
        mentions some uncertainty earlier in its reasoning, its final conclusion is
        based on a difference in length, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final answer, stating that Herzog's film is NOT longer than Nishimori's
        film. This is a direct comparative answer.

        made in the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        and provides a clear comparative conclusion that the first movie (102 minutes)

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that one film was 99 minutes
        and the other was 100 minutes, with the second being slightly longer. The
        NO answer was given because the first film was shorter, not because the lengths
        were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer after reasoning
        about the lengths of the two films, concluding that Fukasaku's film (99 minutes)
        is not longer than "(OBE)'s Yes" (interpreted as Potter's film at 100 minutes).
        While the model expressed uncertainty about the interpretation of "(OBE)'s
        Yes", it ultimately provided a definitive NO answer based on this comparison.

        one value (99 minutes) was less than the other value (100 minutes), not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated the values were different
        (99 vs 100 minutes) and used this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model gave a clear final answer of "NO" in its

        was not because the values were equal. Rather, it explicitly stated that one
        runtime was 99 minutes and the other was 100 minutes, and the NO answer was
        because the first was shorter than the second. The model never claimed the

        for its NO answer. The model does not note any difference in length between
        the films, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times as
        its final answer, and this NO is specifically given as a comparative result

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a final answer of NO, this was
        not because the values were equal - it explicitly stated that one film was
        99 minutes and the other was 100 minutes, with the NO answer being because
        99 is less than 100. The model never claimed the lengths were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "NO" after
        comparing the lengths (99 minutes vs 100 minutes). While it expressed uncertainty
        about which "Yes" film was being referenced, it ultimately committed to comparing
        against Sally Potter's "Yes" film and concluded that 99 minutes is not longer

        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in length, with one being
        95 minutes and the other being 100 minutes. This difference in length is the
        reason given for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer and explicitly stated that
        the reason was because both films have the exact same runtime of 100 minutes.
        This matches the criteria for answering True - the NO answer was given specifically
        because the values being compared (the runtimes) are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation, the model ultimately
        concluded that both films are 100 minutes long and gave a clear final answer
        of "NO" - stating that the first film is not longer than the second film because
        they have the same runtime.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different runtimes (134
        minutes vs 150-155 minutes) and concluded NO because "The Hawaiians" was shorter
        than "Loafer". The difference in runtimes was the basis for the NO answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, stating that "The Hawaiians" (134 minutes) is not longer than
        "Loafer" (150-155 minutes). While there was significant uncertainty and back-and-forth

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the movies had equal runtimes - in fact, it explicitly stated it didn't
        know one of the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO SUFFICIENT INFORMATION"
        and indicates it "cannot make a definitive comparison" due to lacking runtime
        data for "Loafer". This is a case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the comparison, which maps to UNKNOWN.

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different runtimes (134
        minutes vs 165 minutes) and based its NO answer on "The Hawaiians" being shorter
        than "Loafer", not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final step-by-step reasoning concludes
        with a clear "NO" answer, stating that since "The Hawaiians" (134 minutes)
        is shorter than "Loafer" (165 minutes), Tom Gries's film is not longer than
        A. Bhimsingh's film.

        for its NO answer. The values were clearly stated as different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result (stating that The Hawaiians
        at 134 minutes is shorter than Loafer at 165 minutes). While the model expressed

      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", this appears to
        be based on comparing runtime values that were not consistently maintained
        throughout the response. Throughout most of the extensive reasoning, the model
        repeatedly stated it did not know the runtime of "Loafer" and could not make
        a definitive comparison. Only in the final summary did it suddenly claim to
        know "Loafer" was 158 minutes, contradicting its earlier statements. Given
        this inconsistency and the model's repeated assertions that it could not make
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        in the number of installments (2 films vs 4 pieces of content), not because
        the values are equal. The model explicitly states "American Epic has 4 installments
        while the Hera Pheri series has 2 completed films" as the reason for its NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and clearly
        states this as its final comparative answer, indicating that Priyadarshan's
        Hera Pheri series is not longer than Bernard MacMahon's American Epic. This
        is a direct comparative NO answer.

        fact, it explicitly states American Epic has a longer runtime (4-5 hours)
        compared to Priyadarshan's Hera Pheri (156 minutes). The NO answer was given
        because American Epic was determined to be longer, not because the lengths
        were equal.

        was less than the other value (476 minutes). The model explicitly noted this
        difference in values as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer after comparing the
        runtimes of the Looney Tunes collection (450 minutes) and the Race franchise
        (476 minutes). While the model spent a lot of time considering different interpretations,
        it ultimately concluded that 450 < 476 and therefore NO, the first item is

        based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive analysis but ultimately
        gave a clear final answer of "NO" in both its detailed analysis and final

        (7 hours). The model explicitly states there is a difference in length (0.65
        hours) rather than saying the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, concluding that the Looney Tunes collection

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, this was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (137
        minutes) was greater than the other (112 minutes), and this difference was
        the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer multiple times, including in its final structured conclusion.
        While it expresses some uncertainty about one of the runtimes during its reasoning,
        it ultimately commits to a definitive "NO" answer based on comparing 112 minutes

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different runtime values
        (112 vs 137 minutes) and bases its NO answer on 112 being less than 137, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes (112 vs 137 minutes) and determining that 112 is less than 137.
        While there appears to be some inconsistency between the thinking section

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because it
        found one film to be longer than the other (137 minutes vs 112 minutes), not
        because the values were equal. The model explicitly stated the difference
        in running times and used this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" answer in its final
        structured response, stating "William Wyler's 'The Desperate Hours' (112 minutes)
        is not longer than Amjad Hossain's 'Golapi Ekhon Traine' (137 minutes)." Despite
        showing uncertainty in its thinking process, the final answer was definitively
        NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives precise numbers (112 minutes
        vs 137 minutes), it explicitly states there is a difference between these
        values, with one being shorter than the other. The NO answer is given because
        one film is specifically shorter than the other, not because they are equal
        or the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, specifically concluding that "The Desperate Hours"
        is not longer than "Golapi Ekhon Traine". This is a direct comparative answer
        without any caveats about inability to determine or verify.

        in runtime (Tweet Tweet Tweety at 6:45 vs Lumber Jerks at 7:00) and concluded
        NO because Lumber Jerks was longer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Tweet

      explanation_equal_values: While both cartoons are described as being "approximately
        7 minutes" long, the model consistently indicates that Lumber Jerks is slightly
        longer (by 5-15 seconds in various statements). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in length, not on the cartoons being equal in length. The
        model explicitly states "Lumber Jerks runs slightly longer than Tweet Tweet
        Tweety."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in both the thinking process and the formal response, explicitly concluding
        that "Tweet Tweet Tweety is NOT longer than Lumber Jerks" and providing specific
        runtime comparisons to support this conclusion.

        answer. While it mentions some uncertainty about exact seconds, it consistently
        emphasizes that they appear to have "approximately the same runtime" and uses

        given for the NO answer. While the model mentions there could theoretically
        be slight differences in seconds, it dismisses these as unverifiable and bases
        its NO answer on the equality of the standard 7-minute runtime.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear comparative answer stating that Knight-mare Hare is longer than Cheese
        Chasers by about 15-17 seconds.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cd94f1a4-0419-474d-827b-cea85439ca20:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cheese Chasers (7:03) is about
        6 seconds longer than Knight-mare Hare (6:57). The NO answer was based on
        this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO - Knight-mare
        Hare is not longer than Cheese Chasers" after comparing the running times.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, 'Knight-mare
        Hare' is longer than 'Cheese Chasers'" after comparing their runtimes (7:15
        vs 7:00). The answer was clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is only
        relevant to analyze when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES, Chris Wedge's
        'Bunny' is longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged'" after detailed analysis
        of the running times. This is a clear, direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    7d62022c-76ca-449f-8aba-5a4a5530fc68:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model did give a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Throughout its analysis, it consistently concluded
        that "Bunny Hugged" (7 minutes) was longer than "Bunny" (5 minutes). The NO
        answer was based on this difference in length, not because the runtimes were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "NO, Chris Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny
        Hugged.' In fact, 'Bunny Hugged' is longer than 'Bunny.'" This was a direct
        comparative answer, not a refusal or indication of uncertainty.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values classification
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and stated
        "Therefore, YES, Chris Wedge's 'Bunny' is longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny
        Hugged.'" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    ab6d19c1-05da-4681-8d83-af6181ab9ee4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it explicitly
        states there is a difference in runtime between the two films (4.5 minutes
        vs 7 minutes, noting "Bunny Hugged" is approximately 2.5 minutes longer).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, concluding that Chris Wedge's "Bunny" is not longer than Chuck Jones's
        "Bunny Hugged." The model provides specific runtimes and makes a definitive
        comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific lengths for both works
        (4:30 vs 7 minutes), it does not state they are equal - in fact, it explicitly
        notes that "Bunny Hugged" is longer by 2-3 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Chris
        Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged'" as its final
        comparative answer.

    b5cdc436-ef5a-4406-94df-6353c8caac80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found one film
        was specifically shorter than the other (by about 2 minutes and 24 seconds),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states the difference in
        length between the two films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating "Chris Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny
        Hugged'" and provides specific durations showing Bunny (4:36) is shorter than
        Bunny Hugged (7:00).

    c2b9492e-dcde-44e0-9ec2-00d22d9a6a57:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in length, with "Bunny" being 4:30 and "Bunny Hugged" being 7:00, noting "The
        Looney Tunes cartoon is approximately 2.5 minutes longer."
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear and explicit "NO" answer in
        its final conclusion, stating "NO, Chris Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than
        Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged.'" While the model showed significant uncertainty
        throughout its thinking process, it ultimately arrived at a definitive comparative
        answer.

    ce72dd38-f805-4b24-a28f-1b2ab08975c4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in length (Bunny is 5 minutes while Bunny Hugged is
        7 minutes, with a 2-minute difference). The NO is not because the values are
        equal, but because one is definitively shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Chris Wedge's 'Bunny'
        is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged'" and provides specific running
        times showing Bunny Hugged (7 minutes) is longer than Bunny (5 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes (4:30
        for Wedge's vs 7:00 for Jones's) and indicates that one is shorter than the
        other, not that they are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO - Chris
        Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged'" as its final
        answer, providing specific runtime comparisons (4:30 vs 7:00) to support this
        conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially went through several iterations
        of trying to determine the exact runtimes, in its final comparison it clearly
        states different lengths (5 minutes for Bunny vs 7 minutes for Bunny Hugged).
        The NO answer was given because one is shorter than the other, not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO, Chris
        Wedge's 'Bunny' is not longer than Chuck Jones's 'Bunny Hugged'" as its final

        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot determine which film is longer due
        to lack of runtime information. This is a case where the model indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient data.

        determine the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE whether
        the answer is YES or NO" and explains it lacks runtime information for both
        films. This is a clear indication that it cannot make the comparison, which
        falls under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively state..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison, rather than making a comparative
        conclusion. This is a case where the model explicitly states it lacks the
        necessary information to make the comparison.

        their relative lengths due to lacking runtime information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        explains it lacks sufficient information about the runtime of both films to
        make a comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN classification since the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to lack of data.

        all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but immediately clarifies that this is because it "cannot determine" the comparison
        due to lacking runtime information. When a model states "NO, I cannot determine"
        or similar, this should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

        in runtime (115-118 minutes vs 165 minutes) and uses this difference as the
        reason for its NO answer. It does not claim the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the runtimes
        it found (115-118 minutes vs 165 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states there is a difference
        in runtime (Bethune at 115-120 minutes vs Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai at 155-160
        minutes, with a difference of 35-45 minutes). The NO answer was given because
        Bethune was shorter, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final answer, indicating that Bethune is not longer than Bas
        Itna Sa Khwaab Hai. The model provides specific runtime comparisons and arrives
        at a definitive comparative conclusion.

        The model does discuss the cartoons potentially being "similar length" but
        this was not given as a reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", this comes after
        extensive back-and-forth reasoning where the model repeatedly states it "cannot
        provide a definitive answer" and lacks "specific runtime information". The
        model expresses significant uncertainty throughout and contradicts its final
        answer multiple times. The bulk of the response indicates inability to make
        a definitive comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        the cartoons were equal in length. Instead, it suggested "Baton Bunny" was
        likely slightly longer due to "its musical structure and pacing requirements."
        The model noted they were "similar in length" but explicitly indicated a difference
        rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear NO answer in its final
        step-by-step reasoning and conclusion, stating "NO, The evidence suggests
        that 'To Hare is Human' is not longer than 'Baton Bunny.'" While there was
        some back-and-forth reasoning earlier, the model ultimately arrived at and
        explicitly stated a NO answer.

        automatically gets a False answer per the instructions. The model never claimed
        the cartoons were equal in length - it argued one was likely longer than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: YES"
        after detailed reasoning about why "To Hare is Human" would likely be longer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal/same. Instead, it concluded NO because it believed "Baton Bunny"
        would be longer than "To Hare is Human" due to its musical structure requiring
        more runtime. The model specifically argued for a difference in length, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" answer after its reasoning
        steps, stating "To Hare is Human is not longer than Baton Bunny." While the
        model expressed uncertainty throughout its thinking process, it ultimately
        committed to a definitive NO answer in its final conclusion.

        of whether the NO was due to equal values is not applicable. The False answer
        is automatic when the final answer is not NO.
      explanation_final_answer: After extensive reasoning, the model ultimately concludes
        with a clear YES answer, stating "YES - Chuck Jones's 'To Hare is Human' is
        longer than Abe Levitow's 'Baton Bunny' by approximately one minute." This
        contradicts much of its earlier reasoning but provides an explicit comparative

        there is a difference in duration between the two videos (iJustine's being
        "1-2 minutes" and Burton's being "2-3 minutes"). The NO answer is based on
        this difference in length, not because they are equal/same length. Therefore,
        equality is not the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly states "NO, iJustine's
        IPHONE BILL is not longer than Tim Burton's Stalk of the Celery Monster" as

        Instead, it gives the reason that "the premise of the question is flawed"
        because these aren't director-specific collections.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though throughout its reasoning it repeatedly says it cannot make the

        reason to conclude that Volume 5 would have a longer total runtime than Volume
        2" given their similar formats. The model noted they likely had "similar"
        lengths but did not explicitly state they were exactly equal as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after reasoning
        about the relative lengths of the collections. While it expressed uncertainty

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Volume 2 has "more extensive
        bonus features and documentaries, giving it a slightly longer total runtime
        than Volume 5." This difference in length, even if described as slight, means

        qualifies this with "I cannot confirm" and throughout the response repeatedly
        states it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information. This makes
        it clear that the model is indicating its inability to determine the answer

        Additionally, even in the portion where specific runtimes were mentioned,
        they were stated as different values (165 vs 150 minutes), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's response contains contradictions. In its
        lengthy reasoning process, it repeatedly states it cannot determine the runtimes
        and cannot provide a YES/NO answer. However, at the very end, it suddenly
        claims to know specific runtimes (165 mins vs 150 mins) and gives a YES answer.
        When a model gives contradictory responses like this, we should classify it
        as UNKNOWN since there is no clear, consistent answer.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (139 minutes vs 180 minutes) and gave this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Since 139 < 180, Henry Barakat's film is shorter
        than A. Bhimsingh's film".

        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the runtimes
        it identified (139 vs 180 minutes). The answer is given both in the thinking
        section and in the final formal answer section.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values (139
        minutes vs 180 minutes), it does not state that these values are equal. In
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference (139 < 180) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer, not equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times as its final comparative answer, concluding that "There is a Man in

        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final

        this must be False. The model never concluded the values were equal - in fact
        it explicitly calculated a 67.5% probability that one was longer than the
        other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "YES" answer after
        reasoning about typical Bollywood film lengths vs The Magic Mountain's 153-minute
        runtime. While the model expresses uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it
        ultimately commits to YES based on probabilistic reasoning about typical Hindi
        film lengths from that era.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the movies are equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly states different lengths - Geetanjali at 142-145 minutes
        and The Magic Mountain at 153 minutes for the theatrical version (even longer
        for TV version). The NO answer is based on The Magic Mountain being longer,
        not on the movies being equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and consistently
        maintains throughout its analysis that Geetanjali is NOT longer than The Magic
        Mountain. This is a clear comparative NO answer.

        equal. Rather, it gives NO because it lacks evidence that Geetanjali is longer,
        while knowing The Magic Mountain is 153 minutes. The model explicitly considers
        that Geetanjali could be shorter OR longer, and notes that Hindi films from
        that era ranged from 120-180 minutes. At no point does it state or imply the
        runtimes are equal.

        explicitly notes the difference between them, stating that "140 is less than
        153" as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on one being shorter
        than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"

        two films (240 minutes vs 246 minutes) and indicates "My Voyage to Italy"
        is longer by about 6 minutes. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        length, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Long Strange Trip" is NOT longer than "My Voyage
        to Italy." This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about inability
        to determine or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in runtime (3 minutes longer for My Voyage to Italy).
        The NO is not because the runtimes are equal, but because one is specifically
        longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO, Amir Bar-Lev's
        'Long Strange Trip' is not longer than Martin Scorsese's 'My Voyage to Italy'"
        and provides specific runtime comparisons showing My Voyage to Italy is longer
        by 3 minutes.

        between them (241 vs 246 minutes) with "My Voyage to Italy" being longer.
        Since the NO is based on a difference in values rather than equality, this
        is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that "Long Strange Trip" is not longer than "My Voyage
        to Italy." This is a direct comparative answer.

        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear final answer of "YES" after
        extensive deliberation. While it went back and forth considering different
        versions/formats of the films, it ultimately concluded that Long Strange Trip
        (270 mins) is longer than My Voyage to Italy (246 mins) when comparing the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations for both
        movies, it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes a difference
        of about 15 minutes between them (Hamraaz at 185 minutes vs. Mudhalvan at
        169-170 minutes). The NO answer is given because Hamraaz is longer, not because
        the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its response, including as its final conclusion. The model
        provides specific runtime comparisons showing Hamraaz (185 minutes) is longer
        than Mudhalvan (170 minutes) and definitively concludes that Mudhalvan is
        NOT longer than Hamraaz.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Hamraaz (175 minutes)
        is longer than Mudhalvan (169 minutes), showing a clear difference in values.
        The NO answer was given because Mudhalvan was shorter than Hamraaz, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Mudhalvan (169 minutes)
        is shorter than Hamraaz (175 minutes). Despite some uncertainty expressed
        during its thinking process, it ultimately commits to this answer with specific
        runtime values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (169 minutes vs 178 minutes) and concluded that Hamraaz is longer
        than Mudhalvan. The NO answer was given because one value was greater than
        the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Mudhalvan is not longer than Hamraaz, providing
        specific runtime comparisons (169 vs 178 minutes) to support this conclusion.

        the values are different (Hamraaz at 175 minutes vs Mudhalvan at 169 minutes,
        with a 6-minute difference). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a direct comparison showing Hamraaz (175 minutes) is longer
        than Mudhalvan (169 minutes). The answer is definitive and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtime values, it
        does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that
        Hamraaz (180 minutes) is longer than Mudhalvan (169-170 minutes) and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values being compared
        are different, not the same.

        states there is a difference of 7-12 minutes between them (82 minutes vs 70-75
        minutes). The NO answer was given because "The Gleaners and I" is longer,
        not because the runtimes are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" multiple
        times and provides a final clear comparison stating that "The Gleaners and
        I" is longer than "Dot and the Bunny" by approximately 7-12 minutes. While

        NO answer. The model does not note any differences in length between the two
        cartoons, even slight ones, and instead emphasizes that they are the same
        standard length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times throughout
        its response and concludes with a final clear "NO" answer. The model directly
        compares the lengths and determines that one is not longer than the other.

        answer), so by the criteria specified, this must be False. The question about
        equal values only applies when the final answer was NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive reasoning but ultimately
        arrived at a clear YES answer, stating "Therefore, YES - Maurice Noble's The
        Abominable Snow Rabbit is longer than Chuck Jones's Rabbit's Feat because
        the latter doesn't exist as a specific cartoon." The model did not refuse

        (89 vs 91 minutes), not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        minutes between them, with Captain Kronos being longer. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on the values being equal. The model clearly states
        "Captain Kronos appears to be longer by about 1-2 minutes."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific runtimes for both films,
        it does not state they are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different
        values (20 minutes vs 53 minutes) and uses this difference as the reason for
        the NO answer. The values are clearly not the same, and the NO is based on
        one being shorter than the other.

        minutes vs 54 minutes) and gave NO because the first film was shorter than
        the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final definitive "NO" answer, comparing the runtime of "Go There, Don't

        the films were equal in length. Instead, it explicitly stated one was shorter
        than the other (20 minutes vs 50 minutes). The NO answer was based on a comparison
        showing one film was shorter, not that they were the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear NO answer in its final conclusion,
        stating "Vladimir Danilevich's 'Go There, Don't Know Where' is NOT longer

        minutes, and uses this difference (9 being less than 10) as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Munro is not longer than When the Day Breaks. The

        one film (When the Day Breaks at 10 minutes) is longer than the other (Munro
        at 9 minutes). The model explicitly states different values for the lengths
        and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific durations (5 minutes
        for "Bingo" and 7 minutes for "Hooked Bear"), it does not give NO as an answer
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that one is longer
        than the other (7 minutes > 5 minutes). Therefore, the NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times throughout its reasoning and concludes with a final "NO" answer, indicating
        that Chris Landreth's "Bingo" is not longer than Jack Hannah's "Hooked Bear".
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5b0ff30a-5d69-40d1-ad42-5adfee14a8ed:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives NO as its final answer, it consistently
        states there is a difference in length between the two films (approximately
        5 minutes vs 7 minutes, with a 2-minute difference noted multiple times).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in length, not on the films being
        equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in a dedicated "Answer:" section at the end, concluding that "Bingo" is not
        longer than "Hooked Bear." While the model shows some uncertainty during its
        reasoning, it ultimately commits to this comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    63f51516-89f2-43ec-ac44-38fda00bcf80:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        two films (5 minutes for Bingo vs 7 minutes for Hooked Bear) and bases its
        NO answer on Hooked Bear being longer. The values are not equal or approximately
        equal, so this is not a case of equality being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times in its
        final reasoning and concludes with a definitive "NO" after comparing the lengths
        (5 minutes vs 7 minutes). This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7238bb90-597a-4648-acd0-e176dfa023f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it consistently
        states there is a difference in length between the films - specifically that
        "Hooked Bear" is around 7 minutes while "Bingo" is around 5 minutes, making
        "Hooked Bear" approximately 2 minutes longer. The NO answer is based on this
        difference in length, not on the films being equal/same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and repeatedly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, indicating that Chris Landreth's "Bingo" is not
        longer than Jack Hannah's "Hooked Bear". While the model shows uncertainty
        throughout its reasoning process, it ultimately commits to and concludes with
        a definitive "NO" answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different runtimes
        (5 minutes for Bingo vs 7 minutes for Hooked Bear) and concludes NO because
        Bingo is shorter than Hooked Bear.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing whether Bingo is longer than Hooked Bear. The answer is
        given definitively based on the comparison of runtimes (5 minutes vs 7 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria. The question about equal values
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        supported by a clear comparison showing "Nakkash" at 120 minutes is longer
        than "Love in the City" at 110 minutes. Despite expressing some uncertainty
        earlier in its reasoning, it concludes with a definitive YES.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer (it gave YES),
        so by the classification criteria, this must be False. The equal values criterion
        only applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model went through extensive deliberation but
        ultimately concluded with a clear "YES" answer, stating "Since 115 minutes
        is greater than 105 minutes, Zaigham Imam's 'Nakkash' is longer than 'Love
        in the City.'" Despite expressing uncertainty throughout its reasoning, it
        provided this definitive comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, this was not because
        the values were equal. The model reasoned that "Mon Jaai" would likely be
        shorter than "Ajooba" (90-150 minutes vs 174-175 minutes), indicating a difference
        in lengths. The NO answer was based on comparative difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" answer after reasoning
        about typical patterns in Indian cinema. While it acknowledged uncertainty
        about specific details of "Mon Jaai", it ultimately concluded that based on
        industry patterns, "Mon Jaai" is most likely NOT longer than "Ajooba". This
        was a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or indication of inability
        to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I don't have sufficient
        information to provide a YES or NO answer to this question" and explains it
        cannot determine the comparison because it lacks runtime information for "Mon
        Jaai". This indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        concluded the movies were equal - in fact, it stated it couldn't determine
        Mon Jaai's runtime at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer to this specific question based on the information available
        to me" and throughout the response emphasizes that it cannot make a definitive
        comparison due to missing information about Mon Jaai's runtime. This indicates
        it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing to answer or giving a
        clear YES/NO.

        did not give a NO answer based on equal values - it stated it couldn't make
        the comparison due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO - I cannot determine if Mon Jaai
        is longer than Ajooba based on the information available to me." This is a
        case where the model explicitly states it cannot make the determination, which
        falls under our UNKNOWN classification criteria.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. Even if
        we had considered the "NO" as final, the response never indicates the movies
        have equal runtimes - it actually emphasizes that one runtime is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: 'While the model ends with "Answer: NO", this NO appears
        to be expressing inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is evident from the explanation that follows the NO, which states
        "I don''t have sufficient information to confirm" and emphasizes the lack
        of runtime information for Mon Jaai. The response consistently emphasizes

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Rather, it gave NO due to lacking information about
        one runtime while noting "Ajooba" was quite long at 174 minutes. The model
        never claimed the runtimes were equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        even though it acknowledges uncertainty about one of the runtimes. Since it
        provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion (rather than just stating
        it cannot determine), this should be classified as NO rather than UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give its NO answer because the
        values are equal. Rather, it gives NO while acknowledging it lacks information
        about Mon Jaai's runtime. The model speculates that Indian films rarely exceed
        3 hours and Ajooba is already quite long, but never states the runtimes are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model concludes with "NO" as its final answer,
        though this comes after extensive discussion about not having enough information
        to make the comparison. Since it explicitly ends with "Answer: NO", we must

        that 130 is less than 174 as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes (174 minutes vs 130 minutes) and directly states "Mon Jaai is

        values (130 minutes vs 175 minutes) and explicitly stated that "130 minutes
        is less than 175 minutes." The NO was not due to equal values, but rather
        because one value was less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        make the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model never
        claimed the films had equal lengths - it simply stated it lacked the runtime
        information to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "NO INFORMATION." This indicates it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of data, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a refusal or clear YES/NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    e882fecd-0c19-43ad-b2f6-ada4c15e6ad3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model never claimed the runtimes were equal - it simply stated it didn't have
        the runtime information for either film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot definitively state..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model is expressing inability to verify/determine, making it an UNKNOWN rather
        than a NO comparative result. The phrasing shows it's not refusing to answer
        or saying NO to the comparison itself, but rather indicating it lacks information
        to make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Rather, it concluded NO because one
        title was definitively shorter than the other in character count (7 vs 22
        characters). The model never claimed the values were equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly gave "NO" as its final answer
        after extensive deliberation. While it spent most of its reasoning expressing
        uncertainty about movie runtimes, it ultimately decided to interpret "longer"
        as referring to title length and gave a clear NO answer based on that interpretation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        vs 196 minutes) and stated that "Khuda Gawah is 34 minutes longer than Anjathe."
        The NO answer was given because one movie was longer than the other, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Anjathe is not longer than Khuda Gawah. This

        answer was classified as UNKNOWN rather than NO, this automatically results
        in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model's NO was not based
        on equal values, but rather on inability to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, but immediately follows it by explaining that it cannot determine
        the comparison due to lacking information about Ostitto's runtime. Since the
        model indicates it cannot make the determination, this falls under the UNKNOWN
        classification criteria.

      explanation_final_answer: After extensive deliberation in the thinking section,
        the model ultimately provided a clear final answer of "YES" in its response,

        provided a clear final answer of "YES" in both its conclusion and the formal
        step-by-step section at the end. While it expressed uncertainty throughout
        its reasoning, it committed to a definitive YES answer based on its best assessment
