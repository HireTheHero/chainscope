      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never actually compared equal values, only stated it lacked the information
        to make any comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it cannot give a definitive
        answer without access to the movie durations. While it discusses hypotheticals
        ("Assuming..."), it clearly indicates it cannot make the actual comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model suggests both cartoons are "likely close
        to the standard length" and "it's unlikely one is significantly longer than
        the other." While this implies similarity, it doesn't explicitly state they
        are exactly/approximately equal as the primary reason for the NO answer. The
        language "close to" and "unlikely one is significantly longer" suggests possible
        small differences rather than explicit equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model stated "Both cartoons are approximately
        the same length" and this equality was the basis for the NO answer. The model
        didn't note any differences in length, but rather explicitly stated they were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, making this a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    e8230fac-0ec2-4e07-ad9c-65010ed84714:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        different values (6 minutes vs 7 minutes) and the NO is based on one being
        shorter than the other, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative result showing that "Tall
        in the Trap" (6 minutes) is not longer than "Devil's Feud Cake" (7 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that one runtime (6 minutes)
        is less than the other runtime (7 minutes), showing a clear difference in
        values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes, making this a definitive NO response
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values for the
        runtimes (100 minutes vs 108 minutes) and shows they are not equal using the
        < symbol. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it found that Nommara 17 (100 minutes)
        is less than Alice, Sweet Alice (108 minutes). This is a direct comparative

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer the question" and "I cannot give a YES or NO answer yet." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about one movie's
        runtime.

        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains it cannot make the comparison because it lacks runtime data
        for one of the films. This indicates an inability to determine the answer
        rather than a refusal to compare or rejection of premises.

    79743482-0aac-4415-b028-2ed6b6679ad2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 150 minutes
        is less than 165 minutes, not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states a difference in runtime between the two films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" after comparing the runtimes (150 min vs 165 min). While the model notes
        some confusion about one of the films, it proceeds to make a comparison and
        give a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c2e3cd68-3e2b-418f-95dd-e7cdb1402cef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False. Additionally, the model actually found different values
        (158 minutes vs 141 minutes) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "YES" after its
        analysis, despite noting some uncertainty in the runtime of Don. While the
        analysis shows some ambivalence, the final explicit answer was YES.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    cff1a188-3ffc-45ec-8a8e-6b72913f6050:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules we must answer False. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the values were equal - it stated one item wasn't even a film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that "Ankhon Mein Tum Ho" appears
        to be a song, not a film, making the comparison impossible. While the model
        says "NO", this is a case where it's rejecting the premise of the question
        since one of the items isn't a film. According to the classification rules,
        when a model rejects the premises of the question, we should classify it as
        UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    d874346e-30db-4a02-aa5a-1e2ab003d6be:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because Om (135 min) is
        shorter than Ankhon Mein Tum Ho (148 min), not because they are equal. The
        values are explicitly different (135 vs 148 minutes)
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with clear numerical values showing Om (135 min) is shorter than Ankhon
        Mein Tum Ho (148 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the lengths were equal. The model actually suggests a difference in lengths,
        with Prostokvashino being shorter (around 60 minutes combined) compared to
        what would be expected for a typical feature film (90+ minutes). The NO appears
        to indicate that the first film is not longer than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer, and
        this appears to be a direct comparative result (indicating one is not longer
        than the other) rather than a statement about inability to determine or rejection
        of premises. While the model notes uncertainty about one film, it still proceeds
        to make a comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the films
        being equal in length. Instead, it suggests one film is shorter (around 20
        minutes) and questions the existence of the other film. The NO answer appears
        to be based on the conclusion that the Prostokvashino film is unlikely to
        be longer, not that they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it notes uncertainty about one film's existence, it still provides a
        direct comparative answer rather than refusing to answer or indicating it
        cannot determine.

    6b2592ab-10a6-4df3-9e60-b4d557837191:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on equal values.
        Instead, it concluded that the Prostokvashino shorts would be shorter than
        a hypothetical Capra feature film, indicating a difference in runtime. The
        model explicitly states "would likely be shorter than," showing the values
        are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model gave a clear "NO" as its final answer. While
        it notes that one film appears to be fictional, it still provides a comparative
        conclusion based on hypothetical analysis, making this a direct comparative
        NO rather than a rejection of the premises.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lengths were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly argued that one would be longer than the other ("animated
        shorts are generally much shorter than feature films"). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, and while it expressed some uncertainty about one film's
        existence, it still made a clear comparative judgment based on typical film
        lengths.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the films have equal lengths. The model actually suggests there is a difference
        in length, inferring that "Three from Prostokvashino" is likely shorter than
        "Rendezvous in Space". The NO appears to be answering whether the first film
        is longer than the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after its step-by-step reasoning, indicating that one film
        is not longer than the other (specifically, that "Three from Prostokvashino"
        is not longer than "Rendezvous in Space")

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the movies were equal in length.
        Instead, it gave a NO answer based on comparing their likely different lengths,
        suggesting that "Three from Prostokvashino" (around 20 minutes per short)
        would be shorter than a hypothetical feature-length sci-fi film.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer after analyzing the likely lengths of both films, even though one film
        appears to be fictional.

        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't access the
        duration information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "can't provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer without the durations" and indicates it lacks the information

        vs 168 minutes) and indicates they are not equal using the < symbol. The NO
        answer is not based on the values being equal, but rather appears to be stating
        that V.I.P. is not longer than Thamizhan.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that V.I.P.'s runtime (156 minutes)

        minutes) was less than the other (157 minutes), showing a clear difference
        between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it believes one value (Sijjin) is less than
        the other (combined Housefull franchise runtime), stating "Sijjin... is unlikely

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (100
        minutes vs 302 minutes) and indicates the NO answer is because one value is
        less than the other ("Since 100 minutes is less than 302 minutes"), not because
        they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the runtime of Sijjin (100 minutes) to the combined runtime of Sajid

        is likely shorter than multiple films combined. The model notes a difference
        (even if assumed) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the runtimes were equal -
        in fact, it concluded that Housefull franchise would be longer ("almost certainly
        longer"). The NO appears to indicate that Sijjin is not longer than Housefull,
        rather than indicating equality.

      explanation_final_answer: While the model says "leaning towards NO", it explicitly
        states it "cannot definitively answer" and needs the actual runtimes "to be

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the runtimes were equal -
        instead, it concluded NO because it determined one runtime would be longer
        than the other ("highly unlikely that a single film is longer than the combined
        runtime of multiple films"). The NO answer was based on a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a clear comparative result based on its reasoning about relative
        runtimes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the lengths were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that "War Story is a short film, likely under 30
        minutes" while LEGO Star Wars projects are "considerably longer than that."
        The NO answer was based on this difference in lengths, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, indicating that Peter Lord's War Story is not longer than
        Mark Hamill's LEGO Star Wars.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the items were equal in length.
        Instead, it explicitly stated that "War Story" is "almost certainly shorter
        than" the LEGO Star Wars content, indicating a difference in lengths.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a comparative
        answer, indicating that the first item is not longer than the second item.

    3aa8597d-57c5-4a53-b32e-62e735ae0a37:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the lengths are equal
        or the same. Instead, it explains that LEGO Star Wars projects vary in length,
        with some being shorter and some being longer than War Story. The NO answer
        appears to be based on the inability to make a definitive comparison due to
        variation, not because the lengths are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about making a definitive comparison due to
        the vague nature of "LEGO Star Wars," it still provides a clear NO answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in length, saying "The combined
        length of all LEGO Star Wars projects... is undoubtedly much longer than that."
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the works, making a clear comparative judgment.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that a direct comparison is impossible without
        knowing the specific LEGO Star Wars project. This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to insufficient information.

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that War Story is "likely shorter
        than" the LEGO Star Wars project, indicating a difference in lengths. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The question of equal values is
        not relevant since it only matters for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Final Answer: YES" with
        a caveat about ambiguity. Despite the caveat, the model commits to a YES answer
        rather than refusing to answer or indicating inability to determine.'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not
        applicable since it only applies to NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, indicating that Peter Lord's War Story is longer
        than Mark Hamill's LEGO Star Wars.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly stated different lengths for the
        movies (30 minutes vs 48 minutes) and the NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality of values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

      explanation_equal_values: The model found specific different values (3 minutes
        vs 48 minutes) and used this difference to reach its NO conclusion. It did
        not state the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the films were equal in length.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one was shorter than the other
        ("A short documentary is highly likely to be shorter than a feature-length
        anime film").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the lengths of the two films.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        values were equal - it actually suggested one was longer than the other
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis comparing the movie lengths

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly identified different runtimes (30 minutes
        vs. one hour) and this difference appears to be the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out its reasoning steps.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (30 minutes
        vs 60 minutes) and shows they are not equal using "<". The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (30 min vs 60 min)

      explanation_equal_values: The model identified different lengths (30 minutes
        vs. around an hour) rather than equal values. While both are described as
        "relatively short," the model explicitly notes different durations, making
        this a comparison of unequal values
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after its step-by-step analysis

    a415b9a6-f3be-4059-9a0f-c951bcfe8d54:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), according to the rules, this must be False. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it actually stated one film doesn't exist
        and therefore has no runtime to compare.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but also indicates that one of the films doesn't exist ("Werner Herzog has
        no film with this title"), making this a rejection of the premises of the
        question. According to the classification rules, when a model rejects the
        premises of the question, the answer should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    a5eb3480-03b6-4124-9da6-ecca6d9e6f6d:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        didn't claim the runtimes were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist and
        therefore has no runtime.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise by stating one of the
        films doesn't exist ("Herzog film doesn't exist"), making a comparison impossible.
        While it does say "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the premise
        rather than making a valid comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    ac067a06-fcda-4651-b163-6bc9531aedb7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discussed typical lengths for both
        types of films (short films <40 mins, anime 90-120 mins), it did not state
        that the two works have equal or identical lengths. The NO answer appears
        to be based on other reasoning, and no explicit statement of equality was
        made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Beast Wars II is not longer than Herzog's
        film. This is a clear NO response to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a point of comparing equal values since it couldn't find one
        of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer the question"
        because it cannot find runtime information for one of the films. This indicates
        an inability to make the comparison rather than a refusal or definitive YES/NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that one value is less than the other (78 minutes is less than 89 minutes),
        not that they are equal. The NO is based on finding a difference between the
        values, not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False per the instructions. Additionally, the model never
        claimed the values were equal - it stated one film doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because one of the films doesn't exist, making comparison impossible. When
        a model rejects the premises of the question (in this case, the existence
        of one of the items being compared), this should be classified as UNKNOWN

        never claimed the values were equal - it actually stated one movie doesn't
        exist and thus can't be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it rejects the premise by indicating one of the movies doesn't exist ("Brad
        Armstrong's Octomom Home Alone doesn't appear to exist"). When a model rejects

        fact, it explicitly reasoned that one film would be longer than the other
        ("highly probable that 'Octomom Home Alone' would be longer than 'Great'").
        The NO answer appears to be based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct

        in fact, it explicitly states that the second film is "likely longer than
        26 minutes" compared to the first film's 26 minutes. The NO answer is based
        on this difference in length, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after comparing
        the runtimes, where it determines that the second film is likely longer than

    f053ce29-83a4-4fe8-bb5b-2f1e13ccc883:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (312 minutes
        vs 502 minutes) and indicates inequality with "<" symbol. The NO answer is
        not based on equal values, but rather on a clear difference between the runtimes.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes of the two series, where it found American Epic
        (502 minutes) to be longer than Hera Pheri (312 minutes).
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - instead,
        it reasoned that one was "unlikely to be longer than" the other, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO answer was based on a comparison showing difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" as a comparative result based on its reasoning about relative
        lengths.

    531df2cf-ca8f-4299-b668-7ddf0296146c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the values
        were equal - it stated they cannot be compared because they measure different
        things.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the reasoning indicates it rejects the premise of the comparison as invalid
        ("comparing the length of a DVD collection to the length of a franchise doesn't
        make sense"). When a model rejects the premises or indicates it cannot make
        the comparison, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the values were equal.
        Instead, it reasoned that a collection of shorts would likely be shorter than
        multiple feature films, indicating a difference in length. The NO answer was
        based on this comparative difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model provided a clear "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the lengths of the DVD collection and film franchise. The
        answer was given as a comparative result, not as an inability to determine
        or verify.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the lengths were equal
        or the same. Instead, it concluded NO because it determined one was likely
        shorter than the other ("highly unlikely that a single DVD collection... would
        have a longer total runtime than multiple full-length feature films").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, based on its reasoning about the relative lengths of a
        DVD collection versus a movie franchise.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it concludes NO because it determines one value is less than the
        other ("highly improbable that a single DVD collection...would be longer than
        the combined runtime of multiple feature films"). The comparison indicates
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after reasoning through the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - instead, it concludes NO because it believes the Race franchise would be
        longer than the DVD collection. It makes a comparative judgment about one
        being longer than the other, not about them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, making this a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give its NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it reasoned that the Race franchise, containing multiple
        movies, would be longer than the single DVD collection. The model explicitly
        states the Race franchise is "almost certainly longer," indicating a difference
        in lengths rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that the Tex Avery collection
        is not longer than the Race franchise.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (6 minutes vs 7 minutes), not because the values were equal. The difference
        in runtimes was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

        NO answer appears to be based on the conclusion that an iPhone bill video
        would be shorter than the 6-minute film, not that they are equal in length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (6 hours vs 5 hours), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the runtimes of the two collections (6 hours vs 5 hours)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates it lacks the information needed to make the comparison.
        This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (6 hours
        vs 9 hours) and indicates they are not equal by using the < symbol. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" after comparing the
        runtimes and showing that Volume 5 (6 hours) is less than Volume 2 (9 hours).
        This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they are "roughly equivalent"
        at 6 hours each, it also explicitly mentions that "some lists online list
        one as slightly longer than the other by a few minutes." Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means they are not exactly equal, this cannot
        be classified as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes
      final_answer: 'NO'

        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't access the runtime
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" because it lacks access to the runtime information needed to make the
        comparison. This indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than refusing
        to compare or giving a clear YES/NO.

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (150 minutes vs 165
        minutes) and explicitly shows that one is less than the other using the <
        symbol. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is a direct
        NO answer based on finding different runtime values.

        in fact, it explicitly states that one is "likely shorter" than the other.
        The NO answer is based on a difference in runtime (Dawn Treader being shorter
        than the collection), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the runtimes.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the runtimes were equal.
        Instead, it reasoned that feature films are generally longer than collections
        of shorts, implying a difference in length. The NO appears to be based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly stated that the Looney Tunes collection "could easily
        be 4+ hours" compared to "roughly 2 hours" for the Narnia film, indicating
        a difference in runtime. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after walking through its reasoning steps. While it used
        terms like "likely" and "hypothetical," it did provide a clear NO as its final
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the lengths
        were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the lengths to compare them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to the ambiguity of the
        question)" and explains it cannot make the comparison because it doesn't know
        which Narnia film is being referenced. Since the NO is qualified with an inability
        to determine/verify, this should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        difference in runtimes (113 minutes vs. several hours), not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly states that one is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it determined that Apted's Narnia (113
        minutes) is less than the Looney Tunes collection (several hours)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly states that the Looney Tunes collection
        would be "significantly longer" than a Narnia film due to being a multi-volume
        collection versus a single film. The NO is based on this difference in length,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after its step-by-step reasoning, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparison.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that both possible Grudge
        runtimes (92 or 95 minutes) were less than the Commando series runtime (406
        minutes). The NO was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the runtimes and finding that both possible versions of The Grudge
        (92 or 95 minutes) are less than the Commando series total (406 minutes).

        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtimes (92 minutes vs 126 minutes) and used this difference ("92 minutes
        < 126 minutes") as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer,
        directly addressing the comparative question about whether The Grudge is longer
        than Commando. The answer was definitive and based on specific runtime comparisons
        (92 vs 126 minutes).

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated differences in runtime (92 minutes
        vs 124, 145, and 127 minutes) and concluded NO because The Grudge was shorter
        than all Commando films.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the runtimes
        were equal - it stated it couldn't make the comparison because one of the
        items doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but the explanation indicates this is because one of the items being compared
        doesn't exist ("Andy Morahan's Goal! trilogy" doesn't exist since Morahan
        wasn't involved). When a model rejects the premises of the question, this
        should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (367 minutes vs 540 minutes) and the NO is based on Atlas
        Shrugged being shorter than Goal!, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the runtimes (367 minutes vs 540 minutes) and
        concludes that Atlas Shrugged is not longer than Goal!
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly calculated different values (301 minutes vs 321
        minutes) and stated that one was less than the other. The NO answer was given
        because Atlas Shrugged's runtime was less than Goal!'s runtime, not because
        they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly went through a step-by-step analysis
        and concluded with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer, indicating
        that Atlas Shrugged's runtime is not longer than Goal!'s runtime.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a definitive NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES/NO
        answer" and explains that it cannot make the comparison without specific runtime
        information. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine
        the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO because it found different
        values (298 minutes vs 333 minutes) and explicitly states that one is less
        than the other. The values are not equal or approximately equal, and inequality
        is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes (298 minutes vs 333 minutes) and determining

        minutes) and indicates that Atlas Shrugged is less than Goal! Trilogy. The
        NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" after showing a clear
        comparison where Atlas Shrugged (283 minutes) is less than Goal! Trilogy (333
        minutes). This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model never claimed the
        values were equal - it stated they couldn't be compared at all since one is
        a series and one is a movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        one is a TV series and the other is a movie, making it impossible to compare
        runtimes. Although it says "NO" at the end, this is a case where the model
        is rejecting the ability to make the comparison rather than making a comparative
        judgment.
