      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, it clearly states that Frank
        Darabont directed the movie, not Spielberg - indicating a difference rather
        than equality between the actual and proposed directors.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Spielberg directed The Shawshank Redemption. This
        is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (112
        minutes) is less than the other (143 minutes), showing a clear difference
        in values.

        (6:40) is slightly longer than From Hare to Heir (6:30). Since it identifies
        a difference in length (even if small) and does not base its NO answer on
        the values being equal, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the NO in the response wasn't due to
        equal values, but rather due to the non-existence of the movie.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but this NO is given because the movie doesn't exist rather than as a comparative
        result. When a model rejects the premises of the question (in this case, by
        saying one of the things being compared doesn't exist), this should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. The model didn't give a NO answer
        based on equal values - it actually indicated one element doesn't exist.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states that one of the items being compared
        doesn't exist ("Devil's Feud Cake does not appear to be a known movie title")
        and therefore rejects the premise of the comparison. While it says "NO", this
        is a case where the model is rejecting the ability to make the comparison
        due to non-existence of one element.

        notes that one is shorter than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one runtime (165
        minutes) was "significantly longer" than the other (99 minutes). The NO was
        given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference in runtime (100 minutes
        vs 162 minutes) and concludes that one is shorter than the other. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, where it found that the first movie (100 minutes)

        (176 minutes) is longer than Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady (105 minutes),
        not because the values are equal. The model explicitly states different runtimes
        and indicates one is longer than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found different runtimes (128 vs 134 minutes)
        and gave NO because Late Autumn is less than Butley, not because they are
        equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer to whether Late Autumn is longer
        than Butley. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the values are equal -
        in fact, it explicitly states that 128 minutes is shorter than 134 minutes.
        The NO answer is given because Late Autumn is shorter, not because the runtimes
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Late Autumn is not
        longer than Butley" as its final answer, providing a clear comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (128 vs 127 minutes), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is YES"
        after comparing the runtimes and finding Late Autumn to be slightly longer
        than Butley.

      explanation_equal_values: While the runtimes are close (128 vs 130 minutes),
        the model explicitly notes a difference ("Late Autumn is shorter than Butley")
        and does not state they are equal/same/identical. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes and finding Late Autumn (128 minutes) to be shorter
        than Butley (130 minutes).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Late Autumn (128
        minutes) is shorter than Butley (130 minutes). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on the values being equal. The model identifies
        a specific 2-minute difference between the films.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the conclusion of its step-by-step analysis and as a
        final "Answer: NO". This NO is given as a direct comparative result, not as
        an inability to determine.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Karunamayudu (150
        minutes) is longer than There is a Man in Our House (120 minutes). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that "There is a Man in Our House" is not longer than "Karunamayudu".
        This is a direct comparative answer without any caveats about uncertainty
        or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific durations for both
        movies, it does not state they are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that
        120 minutes is less than 150 minutes, and this difference in duration is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Final Answer: NO" after
        comparing the durations (120 minutes vs 150 minutes) and explicitly concluding
        that "There is a Man in Our House" is not longer than "Karunamayudu".'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a 30-minute
        difference between the films (120 minutes vs 150 minutes), with Karunamayudu
        being longer. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        provides a clear comparative answer, stating that "There is a Man in Our House"
        is not longer than "Karunamayudu". The answer is definitive and includes specific
        runtime comparisons.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5bf74baa-e7d7-455b-aa36-8a7fe541394d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was because one
        runtime (120 minutes) was explicitly less than the other (172 minutes), not
        because they were equal. The model identified a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative result based on the runtimes it identified
        (120 min vs 172 min)
      final_answer: 'NO'

    6548fa17-8db5-42e5-b3cd-141eaaf3dbec:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that the runtimes are different (135
        minutes vs 185 minutes) and states NO because the first film is shorter than
        the second.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly makes a comparative determination that the first film is not longer
        than the second film.

        (135 minutes vs 142 minutes) and explicitly stated that Karunamayudu is longer.
        The NO answer was given because of this difference in values, not because
        the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this is a direct comparative result based on the runtime
        comparison it performed (135 min vs 142 min).

      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "No, Peter Jackson''s
        The Hobbit is not longer than Rakesh Roshan''s Krrish series" and concludes

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that The Hobbit trilogy
        (474 minutes) is shorter than the Krrish series (508 minutes), with a clear
        difference in runtime. The NO answer was given because one value was less
        than the other, not because they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the runtimes, finding that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is shorter
        than the Krrish series (508 minutes). The answer is clear and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        there is a difference in length (Krrish series is 498 minutes while The Hobbit
        is 474 minutes). The NO is not due to equal values, but because Krrish is
        actually longer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains that The Hobbit (474 minutes) is not longer than the
        Krrish series (498 minutes)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model found that Krrish series (477 minutes) is
        slightly longer than The Hobbit (474 minutes). Since it identified a difference
        in values (even though small), and did not state they were equal/identical/the
        same, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Peter Jackson's The
        Hobbit is not longer than Rakesh Roshan's Krrish series" after calculating
        and comparing the runtimes (474 vs 477 minutes)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the final answer, but not because
        the values are equal. It explicitly states that The Hobbit trilogy (474 minutes)
        is shorter than the Krrish series (508 minutes). The NO comes from finding
        a difference in values, not from finding them equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" after considering
        the theatrical versions of The Hobbit trilogy as the standard comparison point.
        While it notes that extended editions would yield a different answer, it makes
        a clear final decision.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that The Grudge (92 minutes) is "much
        shorter than" the Commando series (377 minutes). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        a point of comparing values or stating they were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off and does not provide
        any comparative analysis or conclusion about the lengths of the two films.
        The text only provides background information about one of the films (Commando)
        without making any comparison or giving a YES/NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in runtime (140 vs 145 minutes) and concluded NO because the first film was
        shorter than the second.

        different values (130 minutes vs 135 minutes) and indicates that one is shorter
        than the other, rather than stating they are equal. The NO is because Mon
        Jaai is shorter, not because they are the same length.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        when comparing if Mon Jaai is longer than Ajooba, providing specific runtime

        the values were equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot confirm it is longer)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the
        model is expressing inability to verify/determine the comparison, making it
        an UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both films are of
        equal length" and gives this equality (both having "the same runtime of approximately
        7 minutes") as the direct reason for its NO answer. This matches the criteria
        for a True classification where equality is the primary reason for the NO
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both cartoons have
        the same runtime of about 7 minutes" and uses this equality as the primary
        reason for its NO answer, stating "Since both cartoons are the same length,
        Snow Business is not longer than Droopy's Double Trouble."

        minutes) is shorter than Droopy's Double Trouble (7 minutes and 30 seconds).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in runtime, not on the values being
        equal.
