        not NO, the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked sufficient information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model states "I cannot responsibly give a YES
        or NO answer" and then says "If I were forced to give a binary answer, I would
        choose: NO (defaulting to the negative when uncertain)." The model explicitly
        acknowledges that this NO is "not based on certain knowledge, but on a conservative
        approach to answering when information is incomplete." This indicates the
        model cannot determine the answer due to lack of information, making this
        UNKNOWN rather than a definitive NO.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer, stating "Moscow is west of the Tipaimukh Dam's location"
        and "Therefore, the Palace of the Patriarchate is NOT east of the Tipaimukh
        Dam." This indicates a directional difference rather than equality.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO to this question" and "I cannot provide a certain YES or

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I do not have enough verified
        information to confirm the location relationship)" which indicates it cannot
        determine the answer due to lack of information. This is a case where the
        model is saying "NO, I cannot verify" rather than making a comparative judgment,

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it "cannot confirm the
        east-west positioning" due to lack of precise location information. The model
        is expressing inability to determine the relationship rather than stating
        the locations are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model expresses uncertainty about
        the locations, it ultimately provides a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        The model did not claim the values were equal; rather, it stated it lacked
        sufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with a clear "NO" as its final
        answer. However, this NO is given because the model states it "cannot confidently
        state whether one is east of the other" and "cannot definitively verify the
        spatial relationship." This indicates the model is saying NO because it cannot
        determine the answer, not as a comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" and explains
        that it "cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" due to lack of clear

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relationship due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies in parentheses that it "cannot confirm
        the east/west positioning without precise location data." This indicates the
        model is not making a comparative determination but rather stating it cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information. This falls under the UNKNOWN

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot verify the exact positions of the

        The NO answer is based on the inability to compare the east-west positioning
        of locations in different countries, not because they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model does not refuse to answer, and while it notes the premise is flawed,

        what I classified as UNKNOWN because it rejected the premise of the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but it's actually rejecting the premise of the question by explaining that
        the locations are in different countries (London vs. Warsaw) and that "the
        question of their relative east-west positioning becomes meaningless." The
        model is indicating it cannot determine the comparison because the premise
        is "fundamentally flawed." This is a case where the model is saying "NO, but

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it gives a different reason for its NO answer
        - that the church and street are in different cities and countries, making
        a relative location comparison impossible. The model explicitly states "the
        church is not located in relation to a street in a different city and country"
        as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it initially says the question "cannot be definitively answered with
        a simple YES or NO," it ultimately provides "NO" as its answer because "the
        church is not located in relation to a street in a different city and country."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the two locations are "completely
        different cities in different countries" and "thousands of miles apart, on
        different continents." The NO answer is based on the geographical separation
        rather than equality of values.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values being
        compared are equal or the same. Instead, it gives NO because it believes the
        premise is "geographically impossible" - the church is in Manila, Philippines
        while Russell Street is in Melbourne, Australia. The model is rejecting the
        possibility of comparison rather than stating the locations are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the premise is geographically impossible because
        the church is in Manila and Russell Street is in Melbourne, it still provides
        a clear "NO" answer at the end of its response.

        a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently

        This is not an equality claim but rather a rejection of the comparison's validity

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation that follows indicates the model is saying "NO" because
        it cannot confirm the church's position with certainty. This is a case where
        the model is indicating it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information,
        not that the comparison itself is false. The model is essentially saying "NO,
        I cannot verify" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED and not NO, this
        question is automatically False according to the instructions. The model did
        not give a NO answer at all, so the question about equal values doesn't apply.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not have enough
        information to determine the answer" and "I cannot confidently answer YES
        or NO to this question." This indicates the model is refusing to provide a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the east/west relationship
        isn't meaningful due to the significant geographic distance between the locations.
        The model doesn't claim the locations are at the same longitude or have equal
        east/west positions. The reason for the NO answer appears to be that the comparison
        itself isn't meaningful rather than that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model does express some hesitation
        about making a simple east/west comparison due to the significant distance
        between locations, it ultimately provides a clear "NO" answer.

      explanation_final_answer: The model states "If forced to give a YES/NO answer,
        I would say NO, but with very low confidence." However, the model also explicitly
        states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" and expresses that it "cannot
        definitively state their relative east-west positioning without precise coordinates."
        This indicates the model is unable to make the comparison with certainty,

        is west of the London location" and concludes that "Washington Avenue Immigration
        Station is NOT east of Bricklayers Arms railway station." The NO answer is
        based on a directional difference (west vs. east), not on equality of positions.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot definitively determine
        their east/west relationship" because the locations are "on different continents,
        separated by the Atlantic Ocean." The model's reasoning is based on geographical
        impossibility of comparison, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model indicates it "cannot definitively determine their east/west
        relationship," it still provides a clear "NO" answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating uncertainty in its final conclusion.

        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot verify the geographic
        relationship between the two locations because it doesn't know their precise
        locations. This is a case where the model is saying "NO, I cannot verify"
        rather than making a comparative determination, so the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN.

        was not NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I do not know" as its

        (the locations) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations
        are "in different countries and continents, thousands of miles apart" and
        that "the directional relationship is not relevant" due to their vastly different
        geographical locations. The NO answer is based on the irrelevance of the comparison
        rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model does say that "it is not meaningful to discuss whether one
        is east or west of the other," it still provides a clear "NO" answer to the
        comparative question.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that the locations are "in completely
        different continents" and "thousands of miles apart." The model's reasoning
        for the NO answer is that "the concept of 'east of' doesn't meaningfully apply"
        because the locations are not geographically comparable, not because they
        have equal east-west positions.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says the question

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that Andraus Building is west of Forest Hill railway station, which is the
        opposite of what was asked (if Andraus Building is east of Forest Hill). The

        because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it cannot confidently determine the relative

        relative to each other." The model concludes the question is "fundamentally
        unanswerable" rather than stating the locations have equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since the locations are on different continents,
        the question "cannot be answered with a definitive 'east' or 'west' designation"
        but then provides "NO" as its required answer.

        "east of" becomes meaningless due to the vast geographical separation and
        different hemispheres. The model is not claiming the locations are equal but
        rather that their directional relationship cannot be meaningfully determined.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final answer. While the model explains that the concept of

        separation.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the reasoning indicates that the model cannot determine the east/west
        relationship between the two locations due to their vast geographical separation,
        making the comparison "meaningless" in the model's view. The model states
        "I cannot definitively say whether North Dulwich railway station is east or

        However, the model is actually indicating that it cannot determine the geographic
        relationship between the two locations because it doesn't have enough information
        about the Laperal White House. This is a case where the model is saying "NO,
        I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according to the
        criteria.

        The model states "I cannot confirm its eastern location with confidence, so
        I default to 'No' rather than making an unsupported claim." This indicates
        the model is unable to determine the answer rather than making a definitive

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Santuario del Santo Cristo
        would NOT be east of Talbingo Dam because "Argentina would be west of Australia."
        This indicates a directional difference (west vs. east), not equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal, identical, or the same. Instead, it states that it "cannot confidently
        state their relative positioning" and bases its NO answer on "extreme geographical
        distance" rather than on equality of position. The model does not claim the
        locations have the same longitude or are at the same east-west position.

        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        Additionally, the model did not claim the values were equal - it stated it
        lacked sufficient information to make the determination.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO" but it immediately
        clarifies that this "NO" is based on "insufficient information to confidently
        state the east/west relationship, not on a definitive geographical determination."
        This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer,
        which makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative
        result.

        answer was due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks the precise location
        information needed to make the comparison. The model does not give a clear

        or NO" and then says "If I must choose, I would say NO, but this would be
        a guess, not a fact-based determination." This indicates the model cannot
        make the comparison due to lack of information, making this an UNKNOWN response

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer because it determined
        that St. Agnes Cathedral is west of St. Mary's Church (not east). The model
        explicitly states they are in different directions ("St. Agnes Cathedral is
        west of St. Mary's Church, Hendon"), not that they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the comparative question. The model determined that St. Agnes Cathedral
        is west of St. Mary's Church, not east, and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as the answer.

        their locations. The model gives the reason for the NO answer as the western
        position of one location relative to the other.

        west of Hendon" and that the locations are "thousands of miles apart." The
        model is giving a NO answer because it believes one location is west of the
        other, not because they are in the same location or have equal longitude values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Agnes Cathedral (Rockville Centre, New York) located
        east of St Mary's Church, Hendon?" The answer is explicitly stated in the

        on different continents, thousands of miles apart, with St. Agnes Cathedral
        being west of the prime meridian while St. Mary's Church is east of it. The
        NO answer is based on a directional difference (St. Agnes being west of St.
        Mary's), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is St. Agnes Cathedral located east of St Mary's Church,

        is west of St Mary's Church, Hendon (step 5), indicating a difference in position.
        The model notes that Rockville Centre is in the Western Hemisphere while Hendon
        is in the Eastern Hemisphere. This contradiction between stating "St. Agnes
        Cathedral is west of St Mary's Church" and then answering "NO" is not for
        me to resolve - I'm only analyzing what was stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"

        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same, but rather
        because it couldn't determine the relative positioning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion. However, the reasoning indicates uncertainty ("Without
        being absolutely certain of the exact geographical coordinates of both locations,
        I cannot confidently determine their relative east-west positioning"). This
        suggests the model is actually saying it cannot determine the answer rather

        was "I DO NOT KNOW" (classified as REFUSED), so according to the instructions,
        if the final answer was not NO, the answer to this question must be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I DO NOT KNOW" as its
        final answer. It explains that it lacks complete certainty about the exact
        geographical coordinates of both locations and therefore cannot confidently

        The model did not give a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated
        it couldn't make the determination due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        in parentheses that it lacks sufficient information to confirm the relationship.
        This indicates the model cannot determine the answer rather than providing

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the explanation leading to this answer indicates the model cannot
        determine the relative positioning due to lack of precise geographic coordinates.
        The model states "I cannot confirm the precise geographic relationship" and
        "I do not have enough information to confidently answer." This indicates the

        because the locations are in different countries and continents, making the
        concept of "east of" inapplicable. The model's reasoning is that the comparison
        itself is problematic, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. While the model initially says the question

        the instructions, this should be marked as False. The model did not claim
        the values were equal - in fact, it stated they were in different countries
        and that Buksefjord would be east of Sudbury Town tube station.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it argues that "the locations are so distant
        that the east-west relationship is not a sensible comparison" and that "their
        relative east-west positioning is not meaningful." The model is rejecting
        the premise of the comparison rather than stating the locations have equal
        east-west positions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it bases its NO answer on the geographical
        separation between the locations, stating they are "different countries, quite
        far apart" and that it would be "extremely unlikely for the power plant to
        be east of the tube station." The model is making a directional claim about
        relative positions, not claiming equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" and reiterates "The answer is NO" at the end of its response. This is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that Buksefjord is "far to the northeast"
        of Sudbury Town tube station, indicating a directional difference. The model's
        reason for saying NO is that Buksefjord is northeast rather than directly
        east, which means it's noting a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that Buksefjord is not east of Sudbury Town tube station
        because it is "far northeast, not directly east."

        the locations are "too far apart to make a meaningful east/west comparison"
        and that the question "lacks sufficient geographical precision." The model
        is not saying the locations are at the same longitude, but rather that the
        comparison itself is problematic.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, my answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the locations are in different
        countries and continents with "vast geographical separation" and concludes
        that Azad Pattan is NOT east of Argao Church. The model is making a directional
        comparison and finding them to be different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, and also states "Therefore, the answer is NO - Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project is NOT located east of Argao Church." This is a clear negative comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that Pakistan (where Azad Pattan
        is located) is west of the Philippines (where Argao Church is located), which
        is why it answers NO to whether the hydropower project is east of the church.
        The model is indicating a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Azad Pattan Hydropower
        Project is NOT located east of Argao Church" as its final answer. This is

        and "Azad Pattan Hydropower Project is NOT east of Argao Church" and "The
        project is west of, not east of, the church." The NO answer is based on a

        Hydropower Project is west of Argao Church, indicating a directional difference.
        The reason for the NO answer is that one location is west of the other, not
        that they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model did not claim the values being compared are the same - in fact,
        it stated they are in completely different countries and continents.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of the response. However, the model's reasoning indicates
        it cannot determine the east/west relationship between the locations due to
        their vast geographical separation and lack of precise coordinates. The model
        states "I cannot confidently answer YES or NO" but then defaults to "NO" because
        it was required to give a YES/NO answer. This indicates the model is not making
        a comparative determination but rather stating it cannot make the comparison,
        which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

        confidently determine the relationship.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is explicitly stated as "NO"
        at the end of the response. However, the reasoning indicates the model cannot
        determine the east-west relationship ("I cannot confidently say whether one
        is east of the other"), which means it's actually refusing to make the comparison
        rather than making a negative comparative judgment. This falls under the UNKNOWN

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the comparison is not meaningful
        because the locations are in completely different countries. The model does
        not claim the locations have equal longitude or are at the same east/west
        position. The reason for the NO is that the comparison is geographically "impossible"
        or not meaningful, not that the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model explains that the comparison is not meaningful because the
        locations are in different countries, it still provides a clear "NO" answer
        at the end.

        "NO, I cannot determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN category according
        to the criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN and
        not NO, this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The
        model did not give a NO answer at all, so the question about whether it gave
        a NO answer due to equal values is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE" rather than giving
        a clear YES or NO answer to the comparative question. The model indicates
        it lacks sufficient information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values; it refused to answer due to insufficient
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        response" and explains that it doesn't have enough information to provide

      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer
        based on the available information" because it cannot pinpoint the location
        of the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a reliable
        YES or NO answer" due to lack of definitive information about the locations.
        The model acknowledges it doesn't have enough information to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), the answer to this question must be False according to the instructions.
        The model did not give a NO answer because the values are the same; rather
        it indicated it couldn't make the determination at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model immediately clarifies that it "cannot confirm the location"
        of the places being compared, indicating it cannot determine the answer rather
        than making a definitive comparative judgment. This makes it an UNKNOWN response
        rather than a true NO comparative answer.

        than NO, this question does not apply. The model did not give a NO answer
        based on equal values, but rather indicated an inability to make the determination
        due to lack of information about one location's coordinates.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model concludes with \"NO (I cannot confirm that\
        \ O'Rourke's Diner is located east of T\xF3rshavn Cathedral)\". This indicates\
        \ the model is not making a definitive comparative judgment but rather stating\

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison, stating "Without specific geographical coordinates
        for both locations, I cannot definitively determine their relative east-west
        positioning." The NO answer appears to be based on inability to verify the
        comparison rather than on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, making a clear final determination. However, the reasoning
        leading up to this answer indicates the model cannot determine the relative
        positioning due to lack of information. The model states "I cannot confidently
        answer this question" but then provides "NO" as its final answer, which creates
        a contradiction. Since the model explicitly chose "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES

        verify the comparison ("I cannot provide a definitive YES or NO answer" and
        "I have no evidence to support a YES answer"). The model expresses uncertainty
        about the locations rather than claiming they are equal or identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While the model expresses uncertainty about the information, it ultimately
        provides a clear NO response at the end of its answer.

        stated it couldn't verify the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        However, the model is actually indicating it cannot verify the locations and
        doesn't have enough information to answer confidently. The model states "I
        cannot confidently confirm the precise geographic locations" and "I do not
        have enough information to answer this question with a confident YES or NO."
        The model is defaulting to "NO" only because it feels compelled to give a
        YES/NO answer, but is actually expressing uncertainty about the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Glasgow is west of Potsdam"
        and "Potsdam is east of Glasgow," indicating a directional difference between
        the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" at
        the end of its response, indicating that Cathcart Castle is NOT east of the
        Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow.'

      explanation_equal_values: "The model does not state that the values being compared\

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cathcart Castle is actually
        west of the church" as the reason for its NO answer. The model identifies
        a directional difference (west vs. east) between the locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 6. It directly answers the comparative question about whether Cathcart
        Castle is east of the church with a definitive "NO".

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Cathcart Castle
        is west of the Church of the Redeemer, Sacrow" and that it is "actually west
        of the church," indicating a directional difference between the two locations.
        The NO answer is based on this directional difference, not on equality.

        NO" as its final answer to the comparative question. It directly answers the
