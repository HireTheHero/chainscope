      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. In fact, it gives a directional difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The model states "Northeast Tennessee (South Holston Lake)
        is north of Ohio" and concludes that "South Holston Lake, TN is NORTH of the
        shrine in North Jackson, Ohio" (though this contradicts its final answer).
        The NO is based on a perceived directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        Holston Lake is SOUTH of the Basilica (as stated in step 4), which contradicts
        whatever the original question was asking. The model explicitly states a directional
        difference (South Holston Lake is south of the Basilica), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        "Mountain Creek Lake is in north-central Texas" and concludes "Since Corpus
        Christi is south of Mountain Creek Lake, the cathedral would also be south
        of Mountain Creek Lake." The NO answer is based on a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "The answer is NO, Corpus
        Christi Cathedral is NOT located north of Mountain Creek Lake, TX." This is

        this question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model
        did not give a NO answer at all, but instead refused to make the comparison
        due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        answer YES or NO to this question" and "The honest answer is: I do not know."

        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that "Corpus Christi
        Cathedral is located south of Mountain Creek Lake, TX" which indicates a difference
        in location (one is south of the other). This difference in position is the
        reason for the NO answer.

        the model is saying "NO, I cannot determine" because it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
