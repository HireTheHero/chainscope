      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Corpus Christi Cathedral is north of Mountain Creek Lake. The model

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that San Antonio is south of Lake
        Lawtonka, indicating a directional difference. The NO answer is based on this
        directional difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        It concludes that "Since San Antonio is south of Lake Lawtonka, it is NOT
        located north of Lake Lawtonka" and then gives a clear "NO" as its final answer.

        TX is south of Lake Lawtonka, OK, and that's why the answer is NO to whether
        the theatre is north of the lake. The NO is based on directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "The answer is **NO**" at

        The "NO" answer appears to be based on this directional finding, not on equality
        of values.
