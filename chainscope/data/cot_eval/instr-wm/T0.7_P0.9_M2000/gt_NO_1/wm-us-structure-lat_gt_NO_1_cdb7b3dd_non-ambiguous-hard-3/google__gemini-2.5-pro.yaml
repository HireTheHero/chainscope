      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether the lake in Tennessee is north of the shrine in
        Ohio. The model clearly concludes that South Holston Lake is south of the

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that the locations are
        different, with Corpus Christi Cathedral being in South Texas and Mountain
        Creek Lake being in North Texas. The model concludes that "Corpus Christi
        Cathedral is south of Mountain Creek Lake" as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        This is a clear, direct response to the comparative question, indicating that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Mountain Creek Lake is north
        of Corpus Christi Cathedral (not equal positions), and therefore Corpus Christi
        Cathedral is not north of Mountain Creek Lake. The NO answer is based on directional
        difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Virginia is located
        entirely north of North Carolina, indicating a clear directional difference
        between the locations. The NO answer is based on this directional difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center is

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that the Blumenthal Performing
        Arts Center is south of the Paramount Theater because Charlotte, NC is south
        of Charlottesville, VA. The model is indicating a directional difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        indicating a directional difference (south vs. north), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing

        Parle. The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Tuttle Creek Lake is north of Lac qui Parle. The
        model clearly concludes that "Tuttle Creek Lake in Kansas is located south

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Minnesota is north
        of Kansas, and therefore Lac qui Parle (in Minnesota) is north of Tuttle Creek
        Lake (in Kansas). The NO answer is based on a directional difference, not
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Is Tuttle Creek Lake north of Lac qui Parle?" The model clearly
