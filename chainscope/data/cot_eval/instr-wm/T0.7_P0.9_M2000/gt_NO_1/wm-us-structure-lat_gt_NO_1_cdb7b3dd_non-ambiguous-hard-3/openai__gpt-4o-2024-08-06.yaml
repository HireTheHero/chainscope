        are equal or the same. Instead, it explains that Corpus Christi is in southern
        Texas while Mountain Creek Lake is in northern Texas, indicating a difference
        in location. The NO answer is based on Corpus Christi being south of Mountain
        Creek Lake, not because they are at the same location.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is **NO**, Corpus Christi Cathedral is not located north of Mountain Creek

        in central North Carolina, which is generally at a lower latitude compared
        to northwestern Pennsylvania" and "Pennsylvania is north of North Carolina."

        is south of Allegheny Reservoir, PA." The NO answer is based on a difference
        in values (one being south of the other), not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after analyzing the geographical locations of High Rock Lake and Allegheny
        Reservoir. The model concludes that High Rock Lake is south of Allegheny Reservoir,

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (latitudes)
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly states that "The latitude of Rondout Reservoir
        is higher than that of Lake Centennial, meaning it is further north." The
        model gives a NO answer because it found that Rondout Reservoir is further
        north than Lake Centennial, not because they are at the same latitude.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Lake Centennial in
        Maryland is not located north of Rondout Reservoir in New York" as its final
        answer. This is a clear NO response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
