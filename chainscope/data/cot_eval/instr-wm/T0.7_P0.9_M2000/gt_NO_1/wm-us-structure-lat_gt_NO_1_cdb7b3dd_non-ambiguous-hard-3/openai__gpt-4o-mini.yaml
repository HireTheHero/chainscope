        "Mountain Creek Lake is located in the northern part of Texas." The model
        concludes that "Corpus Christi Cathedral is not north of Mountain Creek Lake"
        because of this directional difference, not because of equality.

        Reservoir is located. The model is indicating a directional difference (south
        vs. north), not equality.
