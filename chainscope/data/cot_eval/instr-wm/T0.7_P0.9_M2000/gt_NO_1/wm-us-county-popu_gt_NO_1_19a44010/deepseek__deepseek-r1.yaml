      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (4,147 vs 4,351), it does not state these are equal. In fact, it explicitly
        notes that Deuel is "slightly larger" and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. Since the values are explicitly different (not equal),
        this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Tensas Parish is not
        more populous than Deuel County. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2c4aae63-b333-4c76-b424-f9e0e05fa126:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model does compare specific values (4,147
        vs 4,295), it explicitly states there is a difference between them ("Deuel
        County is slightly larger") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality. The values are not described as being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing that Tensas Parish
        (4,147) is less populous than Deuel County (4,295).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    491de1d1-3348-434a-993b-3c472b96616c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (4,147 vs 4,295),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference and gives this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer, not their equality. The model specifically
        notes "Deuel County has a higher population" as the basis for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" and provides
        specific population numbers showing Deuel County (4,295) has a higher population
        than Tensas Parish (4,147). This is a direct comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a5f3221-dbf8-4d7a-89b0-d3f510924bdb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses similar population ranges
        during its reasoning, its final conclusion is based on a difference in values
        (4,200 vs 4,500), not on equality. The model explicitly states Deuel County
        "maintains a slight edge" in population
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with specific population estimates showing Deuel County
        (4,500) as more populous than Tensas Parish (4,200)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5fb693e6-7f59-4d3d-b978-da8919b75145:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers
        (4,147 vs 4,295), it explicitly states that Deuel County is "slightly larger"
        and has a higher population. The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on the values being equal. Since there is an explicit difference
        noted (even though small), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Tensas Parish
        is not more populous than Deuel County. The answer is supported by specific
        population numbers and a clear explanation.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7666abc6-1aec-4dd5-8ef9-8a636c2a9791:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it does not say NO because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states
        that Deuel County (4,295) has a higher population than Tensas Parish (3,758).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with "NO, Tensas Parish, LA is not more populous than
        Deuel County, SD." The model provides specific population numbers and makes
        a direct comparison showing Deuel County has a higher population.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    cc814f0d-c261-4539-a34a-2b9517f44360:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - instead,
        it explicitly states that Deuel County has a higher population (~6,295) than
        Tensas Parish (~4,147). The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation concluding that Deuel
        County has a higher population than Tensas Parish.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f11168bb-794b-4739-b12b-4982cb5e4a76:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers, it explicitly
        states there is a difference ("Deuel County... has a slightly higher population
        than Tensas Parish"). The NO answer is based on Deuel having more people,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Deuel County (4,295) having a higher population
        than Tensas Parish (4,147). This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f3150897-6dfd-4f81-804a-eaf1aedff141:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers that are close
        (4,147 vs 4,295), it explicitly states that Deuel County is "slightly more
        populous" and provides this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Since
        it identifies a difference rather than equality as the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with specific population numbers, indicating Deuel County
        (4,295) has a higher population than Tensas Parish (4,147).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ff6b6d7e-871d-43d1-a6fe-c61de1ed7b16:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference, with Tensas Parish
        having around 3,800-4,000 people and Deuel County having around 4,200-4,300
        people. The NO answer is based on Tensas having a smaller population, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and reinforces
        this with a clear explanation that Tensas Parish has a smaller population
        than Deuel County. The answer is definitive and comparative.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    0de034fd-8ce8-403d-9c17-8298ef012bce:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the 2020 Census populations
        were very close (215,896 vs 216,403), it did not base its NO answer on them
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Yolo County is "slightly more
        populous" than Lackawanna County, citing different growth trajectories and
        providing estimated 2022 numbers (218,000 vs 212,000) showing a difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation leading to that answer, indicating that Lackawanna
        County does not have a higher population than Yolo County because Yolo County
        is "slightly more populous."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    27bce8ce-983f-43fb-9928-04bc0f1ae576:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (215,896 vs 216,403),
        the model explicitly states that Yolo County is "slightly more populous" and
        uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for its NO answer. The model
        identifies a specific numerical difference between the counties, even though
        small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Yolo County has a higher
        population than Lackawanna County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3d8be6e8-cdfa-4a5f-a0b8-5222a0c0017b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model did note
        very similar populations (215k vs 216k), this is irrelevant since there was
        no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and ends mid-thought
        without providing a final YES/NO conclusion. While the model compares population
        numbers and notes they are very close (around 215-216k), it never actually
        states a final comparative answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    40051159-f0a3-45cd-bde6-29b6a4631a74:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yolo County (220,000-225,000)
        is more populous than Lackawanna County (211,000-214,000), with a clear difference
        in population numbers. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that Yolo County is more populous
        than Lackawanna County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    48c8c61e-d9a6-43e1-94f3-58689b1882fd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give NO because the values are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference in population,
        with Yolo County having approximately 216,000 residents compared to Lackawanna
        County's 209,000 residents. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Yolo
        County has a higher population than Lackawanna County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5afa9ea2-9063-4e32-ae3b-73084ff36616:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Yolo County has a slightly higher
        population (216,403) than Lackawanna County (215,896), with a difference of
        about 500 people. The model notes this difference is likely growing wider
        over time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, providing a clear comparative answer based on population
        figures it cited.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    681ae434-47ab-400a-9f3a-24444b1df555:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the values are close (215,896
        vs 216,986), it explicitly states that Yolo County is "slightly more populous"
        than Lackawanna County. Since it identifies a specific difference in values
        (about 1,000 people) and does not base its NO answer on equality, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing specific population numbers to support its comparative
        conclusion that Lackawanna County is not more populous than Yolo County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    6d5e846d-6ae3-4ede-bc96-c0b821f64212:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are very close
        (only ~500 people difference), it explicitly states Yolo is "slightly larger"
        and has a "slight edge." The NO answer is based on Yolo being more populous,
        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes "NO" multiple times
        in its final paragraphs, stating that Lackawanna County is not more populous
        than Yolo County based on 2020 census data showing Yolo at 216,403 and Lackawanna
        at 215,896.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    80e1e0af-2309-45c8-98d6-77070983de62:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. While
        the model does discuss very similar population numbers, since it never reaches
        a final NO conclusion, we cannot evaluate whether equal values were the reason
        for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete and cuts off
        mid-thought with "For example, Scrant". While the model seems to be leaning
        towards "NO" based on population comparisons it recalls (216,403 vs 215,896),
        it never actually provides a definitive final answer. The response ends before
        reaching a conclusion.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are very close
        (only ~500 people difference), it explicitly states that Yolo County (216,403)
        is slightly more populous than Lackawanna County (215,896). The NO answer
        is based on this small but explicit difference, not on the values being equal.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values question only
        applies when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation showing Walla Walla County (62,584) is more
        populous than Athens County (62,431). The answer was definitive and matches

        results in False according to the criteria. The question of whether values
        are equal is only relevant for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking and in the formal answer section, indicating
        that Walla Walla County is more populous than Athens County.

        (65,000) is "slightly more populous" than Walla Walla County (62,000). The
        values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are very close
        (575,345 vs 576,830, "very close" and "just barely more populous"), it explicitly
        states there is a difference of ~1,500 people with Delaware County being slightly
        larger. The NO answer is based on this small but existing difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "NO" answer, clearly indicating that Union County,
        NJ is not more populous than Delaware County, PA. The answer is definitive
        and comparative.

    10c8d96e-3aca-459a-9a29-650b763f7dea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are very close
        ("they are very close"), it consistently states that Delaware County is "slightly
        larger" than Union County (576,830 vs 575,345). The NO answer is based on
        this small difference, not on the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be cut off mid-thought with
        "But wait, maybe the". Before this interruption, the model had settled on
        "NO" multiple times based on 2020 census figures showing Delaware County (576,830)
        slightly larger than Union County (575,345). Despite some back-and-forth and
        uncertainty, the last clear position was NO.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Delaware County has
        a slightly higher population (576,830 vs 575,345). The difference between
        the values, even though small, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and
        concludes with a final "ANSWER: NO" after comparing the populations. The model

        (555,000 vs 576,000), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Delaware
        County, PA has a slightly higher population"). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Delaware County has a slightly higher
        population than Union County.

        more people" than Union County. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this cannot be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the main response and in the formal conclusion. This
        NO is given as a direct comparative result based on population numbers the
        model believes it knows.

        vs 576,830, "a very small margin" and "difference is minimal"), it explicitly
        states that Delaware County is "slightly larger" than Union County. Since
        there is a stated difference, even though small, this does not qualify as
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-comparison
        after stating Rooks County's population. While the thinking section suggests
        a NO answer multiple times, the final response section doesn't actually provide
        a complete comparison or explicit YES/NO answer. Without a clear final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly gives different values (27,981 for Peach vs 27,238
        for McDonough in 2020) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer.
        The NO is based on Peach having a higher population, not on the values being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific population comparisons showing
        Peach County having a higher population than McDonough County.

        not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that since

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        (5,577 vs 5,842), it explicitly states there is a difference between them,
        with Stanton County having a higher population. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on the values being equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Bent County is not more populous than Stanton County.
        This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's because Stanton
        County (5,902) has a higher population than Bent County (5,461). The values
        are different, not equal, and this difference is explicitly stated as the
        reason for the NO answer ("Stanton County is slightly more populous").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers showing Stanton County has a higher
        population than Bent County. The answer is a direct comparative result, not
        a refusal or inability to determine.

        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after its reasoning, indicating that Bent County is not more populous than
        Stanton County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference
        in populations (64 vs 407 residents) and that Loving County has fewer people
        than Kenedy County. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        - it explicitly notes that Loving County has around 64 people while Kenedy
        County has "around 400 people." The NO answer is based on Loving having a
        smaller (not equal) population than Kenedy.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        for both counties (64 vs 404), it does not state that they are equal or the
        same. In fact, it explicitly notes the difference between them and uses this
        difference (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer, stating that Kenedy
        County is "more populous than Loving County."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        fewer people (around 64 residents) than Kenedy County (around 400 residents).
        The NO answer was given because Loving County is less populous, not because
        the populations are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, followed by an explanation confirming that Loving County is

        - it explicitly states different values (64 for Loving County vs 404 for Kenedy
        County) and uses these different values as the reason for its NO answer. The
        NO is based on Loving being less populous than Kenedy, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, indicating that Loving County is not
        more populous than Kenedy County. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        - in fact, it explicitly states different values (64 vs 400) and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is because Loving is less
        populous than Kenedy, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly explains its comparative reasoning that Loving County (64 people)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially discusses how the populations
        were close in 2020 (48,396 vs 49,130), its final NO answer is based on a clear
        difference in the 2022 estimates (48,306 vs 51,536). The NO is not due to
        equal values, but because Burnet County is explicitly stated to have a higher
        population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a step-by-step explanation showing that Burnet County

        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are not
        stated to be equal/identical, and the NO is based on Burnet being larger,
        not on equality.

        and uses these differences to justify its NO answer. The NO is based on Burnet
        County being "more populous," not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative answer that Lincoln Parish is not more populous than Burnet County,

        The model explicitly states that Burnet County's population "exceeds" Lincoln
        Parish's population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        (434,000 vs 446,000), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Santa Barbara
        County has a slightly higher population") and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end
        of its response, after concluding that Santa Barbara County has a slightly

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Santa Barbara County's
        population (448,229) exceeds Jefferson Parish's (434,767). The NO answer was
        given because Santa Barbara is larger, not because the populations are the

        population (448,000) is explicitly stated to be larger than Jefferson Parish's
        (434,000) by 14,000 people. The values are not equal, and the NO is based
        on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        County (446,000) is MORE populous than Jefferson Parish (432,000), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states the difference in values and uses
        this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific

        higher population" and is "a bit higher." Since the model identifies a difference
        in values (even though small) rather than equality as the reason for its NO
        answer, this does not qualify as equal values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model indicates the populations are close,
        it consistently states that Broward has a slightly higher population (e.g.,
        "Broward's population (~1.96 million) remains marginally higher than Santa
        Clara's (~1.89-1.9 million)"). The NO answer is based on this difference in
        values, not on the values being equal. The model explicitly notes the difference
        in populations throughout its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the one-word response and in the detailed explanation.
        This NO is given as a direct comparative result, indicating that Santa Clara
        County does not have a higher population than Broward County.

        vs 1.95M), it explicitly states that Broward is "slightly larger" and "marginally
        more populous." Since the model identifies a difference in values (even though
        small) rather than stating they are equal, this does not qualify as a NO due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and confirms this
        with "Thus, Santa Clara County is not more populous than Broward County."
        The answer is clearly stated and represents a comparative result.

        vs 1,949,819), it explicitly states that "Broward County is slightly more
        populous" and describes Broward as "slightly larger." Since it identifies
        a difference in values (even though small) rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times as its
        final answer and provides specific population numbers showing Broward County
        (1,949,819) is larger than Santa Clara County (1,938,524). The answer is a

      explanation_equal_values: While the model expresses uncertainty and considers
        multiple scenarios where the populations might be similar, it ultimately gives
        its NO answer based on Payette having a higher population (25,607) than Uvalde
        (24,564). The NO answer is based on Payette being more populous, not on the

        never reached a definitive NO answer, so we cannot evaluate whether equal
        values were the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive deliberation but
        never reaches a clear YES/NO conclusion. It repeatedly expresses uncertainty,
        presents multiple conflicting possibilities, and ends mid-thought with "Wait,
        I think I might have mixed them up. Let". The response shows the model was
        unable to make a definitive comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The response shows the model working through various
        considerations about both counties' populations, but never reaches a definitive
        YES/NO conclusion. The model speculates about various population ranges (around
        160k for both counties) but explicitly expresses uncertainty multiple times
        ("I'm not sure", "maybe") and ends mid-thought without making a final comparative

        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        did discuss scenarios where the values could be equal or very close, but since
        it didn't give a final NO answer, those discussions are not relevant to this
        classification.
      explanation_final_answer: The model goes through extensive reasoning but never
        provides a clear final YES/NO answer. It ends by presenting two scenarios
        - one where Highland is higher (43,317 vs 43,127) which would mean YES, and
        another where Cerro Gordo is higher which would mean NO. The model doesn't
        commit to either scenario, effectively refusing to make a definitive comparison.

        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with population figures showing Gaines County has a higher
        population (21,598) than Pointe Coupee Parish (20,758).

        - it explicitly notes a difference, saying "LaSalle Parish had a population
        of 14,791, while Renville County, MN had 14,723" and describes LaSalle as
        "marginally more populous." Even though the difference is described as "slight,"
        any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.

        and "consistently had a slightly higher population." The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality. The values are explicitly stated to be
        different, even if the difference is small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a difference of about 68 people. So almost the same"), it explicitly states
        there is a difference with LaSalle Parish being "slightly higher" than Renville
        County. The NO answer is based on this small but existing difference, not
        on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing LaSalle Parish
        (14,791) having a higher population than Renville County (14,723). The answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (95,000 vs
        97,000), it explicitly states there is a difference ("Sherburne County has
        a slightly higher population") and this difference, not equality, is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are close but not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that Sherburne
        County has a slightly higher population than Cape May County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sherburne County has a slightly
        higher population (~97,000) than Cape May County (~95,000). The difference
        in values, even though small, means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Sherburne County has a slightly higher population
        than Cape May County.

      result: 'NO'
    dea61cdf-f28d-42ee-b26a-b0a1f6371124:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because it finds Sherburne
        County (97,000) to be more populous than Cape May County (92,000) - a difference
        of 5,000 people. The values are not equal, and the NO is based on Sherburne
        being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides a direct
        comparative conclusion that Sherburne County (97,000) is more populous than
        Cape May County (92,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are close (16,673 vs 16,759),
        the model explicitly notes a difference of 86 people and states that "Dixie
        County has a slightly higher population." The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms this with numerical reasoning, comparing Piatt County's
        population of 16,673 to Dixie County's 16,759.

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (16,759 vs 16,673),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("marginally higher") and
        this difference is the reason for the NO answer, not their equality. The model
        identifies a specific numerical difference between the counties.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, concluding that Dixie County (16,759) has
        a marginally higher population than Piatt County (16,673).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give equality as the reason for
        its NO answer. Instead, it concludes NO because Dixie County has a larger
        population than Piatt County (16,971 vs 16,608), showing a clear difference
        in values. The model explicitly states that Dixie "exceeds" and has "surpassed"
        Piatt's population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after detailed analysis, and this is a clear comparative conclusion rather
        than a refusal or inability to determine.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the values are close (16,673 vs 16,759), the
        model explicitly states that Dixie County is "slightly higher" and "slightly
        more populous" than Piatt County. Since the model identifies a difference
        between the values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Dixie County (16,759) has a slightly higher population
        than Piatt County (16,673).

    8dfd2fbf-edad-49ff-aaac-d8d8463d7df9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model found the populations to be close
        (16,759 vs 16,673), it explicitly stated that Dixie County had a "slightly
        higher population" than Piatt County. The NO answer was based on this small
        difference, not on the values being equal. The model consistently emphasized
        that Dixie was more populous, even if by a small margin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        a clear step-by-step explanation showing that Dixie County (16,759) had a
        slightly higher population than Piatt County (16,673). The answer was definitive
        and comparative.

        states that Dixie County has a higher population (16,903) than Piatt County
        (16,673). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being
        equal. The model consistently maintains throughout that Dixie County is "slightly
        larger" or "more populous."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and supports this with population numbers showing Dixie County has a higher
        population than Piatt County (16,903 vs 16,673 in 2022 estimates).

        are equal is not relevant since we only evaluate that for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model shows the values are very close (16,673
        vs 16,759), it explicitly states that Dixie County is "slightly larger" and
        has a higher population by 86 people. Since the model identifies a difference,
        even though small, rather than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing specific population numbers and explicitly concluding that Piatt
        County is NOT more populous than Dixie County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close ("Though
        the difference is small"), it explicitly states there is a difference (Dixie
        County has 86 more people) and this difference, not equality, is the reason
        for the NO answer. The values are not described as equal/identical/the same.

        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. Since there is an
        explicit difference noted, even though small, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including
        as its final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Marin
        County is not more populous than St. Tammany Parish.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about the populations being equal or different.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be corrupted or mixed with
        unrelated content about Polish verbs. The model started to analyze the population
        comparison but never completed the analysis or provided a clear YES/NO answer.
        The response ends abruptly and transitions into dictionary content about Polish
        verbs.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        that St. Tammany Parish has a "slightly higher population" (270,000 vs 262,000).
        The NO is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal
        or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides specific population numbers to support this conclusion (Marin:

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because St. Tammany Parish
        (264,570) is slightly larger than Marin County (262,231), not because they
        are equal. The model explicitly notes "a difference of about 2,300 people,
        with St. Tammany slightly larger."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing that Marin County is less populous than St. Tammany
        Parish. The answer is clear and direct.

        model explicitly states that St. Tammany Parish has a "slightly larger population"
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not because they
        are equal. The model identifies a specific numerical difference between the
        locations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        model explicitly states that St. Tammany Parish is "slightly more populous"
        and has a higher population. The NO answer is based on this small difference,
        not on equality of the values. The model consistently maintains that St. Tammany
        has a larger population, even if by a small margin.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" multiple
        times, including as its final answer, concluding that Marin County is not
        more populous than St. Tammany Parish. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        vs 264,570) and 2023 estimates (263,000 vs 271,000), describing St. Tammany
        as having "a slight edge" and being "more populous." The NO answer is based
        on St. Tammany having a higher population, not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "ANSWER: NO" at the end

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses specific population numbers
        for both locations, it does not indicate they are equal. Instead, it explicitly
        states that St. Tammany Parish has a larger population (269,698) compared
        to Marin County (260,206), and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
        The values are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Marin County,
        CA is less populous than St. Tammany Parish, LA." The answer indicates a clear
        direction of comparison.

        - in fact, it explicitly states St. Tammany Parish had 264,570 people while
        Marin County had 262,231 people, showing a difference. The NO answer is based
        on St. Tammany being "slightly ahead" and having a higher population, not
        because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" and provides
        specific population numbers showing St. Tammany Parish has a higher population
        than Marin County. The answer is clearly stated and supported with data.

        while LaGrange County has 40,446 people, a difference of 28 people. While
        these numbers are close, the model explicitly notes this difference ("Amador
        County has 28 more residents") and uses this difference as the basis for its
        NO answer, rather than stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        The model's extensive discussion of various population scenarios and their
        relative differences is not relevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO conclusion. The model considers multiple scenarios
        and possibilities, going back and forth between whether LaGrange or Amador

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not say NO because the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference of 28 people (40,474 vs
        40,446) with Amador County being slightly larger. While this is a small difference,
        any difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this in its step-by-step explanation, clearly indicating that
        LaGrange County is not more populous than Amador County.

        "slightly higher" or "just barely more populous." Since the NO answer is based
        on an explicit difference (even though small) rather than equality, this does
        not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        the response does discuss very similar population numbers (40,474 vs 40,446),
        this is irrelevant since there was no final NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The response shows extensive deliberation but never
        reaches a clear final YES/NO answer. While it mentions "NO" at points, these
        are always followed by additional uncertainty and alternative possibilities.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not give a NO answer because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Manassas Park City (17,219)
        had a slightly higher population than Tama County (17,135) in 2020, and suggests
        this gap has likely widened since then. The NO answer is based on this difference,

        providing specific population numbers and clearly concluding that McLean County
        is more populous based on 2020 Census data. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        - it explicitly notes a difference, saying Archer County (8,560) has a slightly
        higher population than Mathews County (8,533). Even though the difference
        is small, any stated difference means this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes

        than Hood River County. The NO answer is based on this difference in values,
        not on the values being equal. Since there is an explicit difference noted,
        even though it's described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly notes that Laramie County has a "slight edge" and is
        "marginally more populous." Since the model identifies a difference, even
        though small, this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.

        the model explicitly states that "Laramie is slightly larger" and uses this
        difference as the reason for its NO answer. Since the model identifies a difference,
        even though small, rather than equality as the reason for its answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by specific population numbers showing Laramie County
        has a larger population than Garland County.

        more populous") and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model never claims the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Garland County is not more populous than Laramie County, providing specific
        population numbers from the 2020 Census (100,180 vs 100,512) to support this

        it explicitly states there is a difference (Laramie County has 251 more people)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The model does not
        base its NO answer on the values being equal/identical/the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with numerical evidence showing Laramie County (100,863)

        The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear

    707e686f-b4b2-4edf-bd81-6c8cebe0fd0b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific numbers (84,223 vs
        85,643), it indicates that Newport County has a "slightly higher" population
        than Orangeburg County. Since it identifies a difference between the values
        (even though small), this does not qualify as stating the values are equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a6907be2-6870-4587-a3bb-b2c114eb4c3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close ("similar"
        and "very close" are mentioned), it explicitly states there is a difference
        (Newport at 85,643 vs Orangeburg at 84,223) and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer, not their equality. The NO is because Newport is "slightly
        more populous," not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reinforces this with a clear explanation that Newport County has a higher
        population (85,643) than Orangeburg County (84,223).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    a97160dd-0f6d-4299-95b2-057f076dda6f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model showed the populations were close
        (84,223 vs 85,643), it explicitly stated there was a difference ("Newport
        County is slightly more populous") and this difference, not equality, was
        the reason for the NO answer. The values were not described as equal/identical/the
        same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and provided
        specific population numbers showing Newport County (85,643) having a higher
        population than Orangeburg County (84,223). The answer was clearly stated
        as a comparative result.

    f1330e87-1ff7-4202-aca9-c5d6e9a4936b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Newport County
        (85,643) is slightly more populous than Orangeburg County (84,223). The values
        are different, not equal, and this difference is explicitly stated as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" and provides specific
        population numbers showing Newport County has a higher population than Orangeburg
        County. This is a direct comparative answer to whether Orangeburg County has
        a higher population.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    f84f7c86-01bf-45bc-a713-62798fa47258:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close (84,223
        vs 85,643), it explicitly states Newport County has a "slightly higher population"
        than Orangeburg County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        the values being equal. The model consistently maintains throughout that Newport
        has a higher (not equal) population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion based on population numbers it recalled
        (84,223 vs 85,643). The answer is formatted in bold and clearly stated at
        the end.

        whether values were equal is not relevant since we only evaluate equality
        as a reason for NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after reasoning through various scenarios. While it showed
        some uncertainty throughout its analysis, it ultimately committed to a YES
        answer based on 2020 Census numbers it recalled.

        its thinking process, in its final conclusion it states that McDuffie County
        has a "slightly higher population" (22,000 vs 21,500). Since the values are
        different (not equal) and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that McDuffie County (22,000) is more populous than
        Gage County (21,500), providing a direct comparative conclusion.

        small but existing difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific population numbers showing
        Saguache County (6,368) having a slightly higher population than Moody County
        (6,336).

        (6,336 vs 6,368), it explicitly states that "Saguache County is slightly more
        populous" and describes it as having a higher population. The NO answer is
        based on Saguache being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        more populous" than Moody County (6,336), with a difference of 32 people.
        The NO answer is based on this small but definite difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        more populous" than Moody County. The NO answer is based on this small but
        real difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Saguache County (6,368) has a higher population
        than Moody County (6,336). This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        Moody County has a higher population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer because Saguache County
        (6,368) is "slightly more populous" than Moody County (6,336). Since the model
        explicitly states there is a difference in values (even though small), this
        is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly provides the comparative reasoning that Saguache County (6,368)

        more residents" than Hanover). The NO is based on this difference, not on
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a final "NO" answer, supported by specific population numbers showing

        vs 110,000-111,000), it specifically states that "Cowlitz County has a slight
        edge in population" and gives different ranges for the two counties. Since
        the model indicates a difference exists, even though small, this is not a
        case where the NO answer was given because the values are exactly equal.

        Cowlitz being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        explicitly states that Cowlitz County (110,730) is "slightly higher" than
        Hanover County (109,979). The NO answer is based on this small but definite
        difference, not on the values being equal. The model consistently maintains
        throughout that Cowlitz has a slightly larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and reaffirms this with a clear explanation comparing the populations (109,979
        vs 110,730). The answer is a direct comparative result, not a refusal or inability

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, while the response
        does compare values, it never states they are exactly equal - in fact, it
        consistently notes differences between the populations both in 2020 census
        data and estimates.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be incomplete, ending mid-sentence
        at "3. **Conclusion". Without seeing the model's final explicit YES/NO statement,
        we must classify this as UNKNOWN. While the response seems to be leaning towards
        YES based on the analysis, we cannot assume the final answer without seeing
        it stated explicitly.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the populations being close,
        it consistently notes that Cowlitz (110,730) was slightly larger than Hanover
        (109,979) in the 2020 Census. The NO answer was given because Cowlitz was
        actually larger, not because the values were equal. The model explicitly states
        the difference in values, even though small.
      explanation_final_answer: The response appears to be truncated, but throughout
        the lengthy reasoning, the model repeatedly concludes that based on 2020 Census
        data (which it considers most reliable), Cowlitz (110,730) was slightly larger
        than Hanover (109,979). While it speculates about possible changes since then,
        it ultimately settles on "NO" multiple times based on the most recent confirmed

        and gives specific different numbers. The NO answer is based on Latimer being
        larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times and concludes
        with a definitive "NO" followed by numerical justification. The model compares
        specific population values and determines that Greenlee (9,563) is less populous
        than Latimer (10,184).

        is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" multiple times, including

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states different values for the counties (Rankin ~157,000
        vs Comal ~161,501 in 2020, growing to ~170,000 by 2023) and uses this difference
        as the basis for its NO answer. The model specifically notes that "Comal County's
        population surpasses Rankin County's."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and reinforces this with a structured explanation concluding
        that "Rankin County, MS, is not more populous than Comal County, TX." The
        answer directly addresses the comparative question.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Comal County (161,501) had a larger population
        than Rankin County (155,271) in 2020, and suggests this gap has likely widened
        since then. The NO answer is based on Comal being more populous, not on equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making a clear comparative conclusion that
        Rankin County is not more populous than Comal County.

        (155,271 for Rankin vs 161,501 for Comal), it explicitly states that Comal
        was "slightly higher" and "larger" than Rankin. The NO answer is based on
        this difference in values, not on them being equal. Since any difference,
        even if described as "slight," means the values are not equal, this cannot
        be classified as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, confirming that Rankin County is not more populous than Comal
        County. This is a direct comparative answer, not a refusal or inability to

        different values (Rankin ~160,000 vs Comal ~175,000 in 2023 estimates) and
        indicates Comal is more populous. The NO answer is given because Comal has
        a higher population than Rankin, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, both in the initial response and in the final summary. The model
        directly answers the comparative question of whether Rankin County is more

        is "slightly larger" than Rankin. The NO answer is based on this difference
        in populations, not on them being equal. Since there is an explicit difference
        noted, even though it's described as "slight," this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        a "slightly higher population" and uses this difference as the reason for
        its NO answer. Since there is an explicit difference noted, even though small,
        this does not qualify as equal values

        vs 3,081), not equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The response ends abruptly without a clear YES/NO
        conclusion. While it presents census data showing Hand County (3,145) having

    2e1f5b40-1839-46a1-9909-bdf14aca6b18:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers
        that are very close (65,763 vs 65,920), it explicitly states there is a difference
        of 157 people, with Starr County being larger. The NO answer is based on this
        small but explicit difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, supported by a step-by-step explanation concluding that Sauk
        County is not more populous than Starr County. The answer is definitive and
        comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted the populations were close (65,920
        vs 65,763 in 2020), it consistently maintained that Starr County had a slightly
        higher population, both in 2020 and in more recent estimates (68,000 vs 66,000).
        The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" and clearly
        stated this was because Starr County has a higher population than Sauk County.
        The answer was direct and unambiguous.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the values are very close (65,763 vs 65,920),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Starr County is slightly
        more populous") and uses this difference, not equality, as the reason for
        its NO answer. The model notes that Starr County has a higher population,
        even if by a small amount.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly compares the populations, determining that Starr County is
        slightly more populous than Sauk County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are close ("the
        difference is small"), it explicitly states there is a difference with Starr
        County being "slightly less populous" and having "marginally higher population."
        The model gives specific different values (65,000 vs 65,900) and does not
        base its NO answer on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and provides a clear
        comparative conclusion that Sauk County is less populous than Starr County,
        with specific population estimates given (65,000 vs 65,900)
