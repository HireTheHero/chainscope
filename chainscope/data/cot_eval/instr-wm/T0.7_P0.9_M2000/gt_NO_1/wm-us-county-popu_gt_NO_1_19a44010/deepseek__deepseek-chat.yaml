      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers,
        it shows that the values are different (4,147 vs 4,295) and explicitly states
        that Tensas Parish has a "smaller population than" Deuel County. The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tensas Parish, LA is
        not more populous than Deuel County, SD" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "Both Tensas Parish,
        LA and Deuel County, SD have roughly the same population" and uses this equality
        as the primary reason for its NO answer, stating "Since the populations are
        approximately equal." Both locations are given the same value of "approximately
        4,300 people"
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Tensas Parish, LA is not more populous
        than Deuel County, SD"

        (4,147 vs 4,295) and explicitly states that Tensas Parish "has a smaller population
        than" Deuel County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Tensas Parish, LA, is not more populous than

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Tensas Parish (4,147)
        has a smaller population than Deuel County (4,295). The NO answer is based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.

      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are given, the model explicitly
        states there is a difference in population (Tensas Parish has a smaller population
        than Deuel County) rather than stating they are equal. The NO answer is based
        on Tensas Parish having a lower population, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tensas Parish is more populous than Deuel County, providing specific
        population numbers showing Tensas Parish has a smaller population (4,147 vs
        4,295).

        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO. Tensas Parish, LA, is

        County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.

        in values is clearly stated as the reason for the NO answer.

        was based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Tattnall County, GA, is not more populous than
        Poinsett County, AR." This is a direct comparative answer.

        not because they are equal. The model shows different values and explicitly
        states one is smaller than the other.

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly smaller") and
        does not claim they are equal. The NO answer is based on Tattnall having a
        smaller population, not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        there is a difference in populations (28,542 vs 29,606) and indicates McPherson
        County has a smaller population. The NO is not due to equal values, but due
        to one value being smaller than the other.

        model explicitly states there is a difference ("slightly smaller") and does
        not claim they are equal. The NO answer is based on Clearfield having a smaller
        population, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows that the values are different (2,500 vs 2,600) and bases its NO answer
        on Frontier County having more people than Rich County, not on them being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        County, providing a direct comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (2,500 vs 2,600),
        the model explicitly states there is a difference and does not claim they
        are equal. The NO answer is based on Rich County having a smaller population,
        not on the populations being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Rich County, UT is more populous than Frontier County, NE, and
        provides specific population numbers showing Rich County has a smaller population
        (2,500 vs 2,600).

        County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly confirms "Rich County, UT is not more populous than Frontier
        County, NE." This is a direct comparative answer.

        identifies a difference in values (even though small) rather than stating
        they are equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, this
        does not qualify as equal values.

        Yavapai County. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that "Oneida County, NY is not more populous than Yavapai
        County, AZ." This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly states different values for the
        populations (9,000 vs 10,000) and indicates that Greenlee County is "less
        populous" than Latimer County. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Greenlee County (9,000) is

      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly explains that Rankin County is not more populous than Comal

        "has a smaller population than" Comal County. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but rather due to a clear difference in population numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Rankin County, MS, is not more populous than
        Comal County, TX." This is a direct comparative answer.

        has a "smaller population than" Comal County. The NO is not due to equal values,
        but due to one being smaller than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes that "Rankin County, MS, is not more populous than

        they are equal. The values are explicitly different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rankin County, MS

        it indicates that Rankin County (155,000) is smaller than Comal County (161,000).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being
        equal. Therefore, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Rankin County is less populous

        was less populous than Comal County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        and gives different population figures (65,000 vs 65,000-70,000). The NO answer
        is based on Starr County being more populous, not on equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Sauk County, WI, is not more populous than Starr
        County, TX. This is a direct comparative answer.
