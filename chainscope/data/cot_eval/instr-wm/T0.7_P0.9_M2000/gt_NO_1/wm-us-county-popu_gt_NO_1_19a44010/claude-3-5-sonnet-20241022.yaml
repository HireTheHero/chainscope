      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and finding Tensas Parish to be larger
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    5eec308d-7e2d-4973-86bb-eea7dc9dbb9b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Deuel County has
        "slightly more people" and shows different approximate values (Tensas ~4,200
        vs Deuel ~4,300). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Tensas
        Parish is NOT more populous than Deuel County" in its step-by-step reasoning,
        providing a definitive negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the populations and determining that Tensas Parish has more residents than
        Deuel County.
      final_answer: 'YES'

    743c24a2-a08b-440f-a901-4d2775324dd5:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4,200
        vs 4,300) and uses this difference (4,200 < 4,300) as the basis for its NO
        answer. The values are not equal or described as approximately equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Tensas Parish, LA is
        not more populous than Deuel County, SD" as its final answer, providing a
        direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    794a5c26-ada7-4566-b2ea-71ce9c6d839a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4,334
        vs 4,364) and states that Tensas Parish has fewer people than Deuel County.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Tensas Parish has fewer
        people than Deuel County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    914a4b6d-f064-4864-aef6-e332893035d0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are similar
        ("very similarly sized counties") and provides close numbers (4,334 vs 4,236),
        it actually shows Tensas Parish has a slightly larger population (4,334 >
        4,236) and doesn't cite equality as the reason for its NO answer. In fact,
        the numbers it provides contradict its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Tensas Parish, LA
        is NOT more populous than Deuel County, SD." This is a clear NO answer to
        the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b616f64d-9c3f-4606-95ec-c2fe9acc7f2f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in population ("Tensas Parish has slightly fewer residents") and this difference
        was the basis for the NO answer. Even though the ranges overlap, the model
        specifically noted a difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer after analyzing the populations of both locations and determining
        Tensas Parish has slightly fewer residents.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e0bb64d5-9cc0-4869-b485-9139305b05b8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are described as "very close,"
        the model explicitly states that "Deuel County, SD is slightly larger." Since
        it notes this difference (even if small), this is not a case where the NO
        answer was given because the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Tensas
        Parish is NOT more populous than Deuel County" in its step-by-step analysis.
        This is a clear negative comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f82200a6-f780-475e-835a-03a8cbc9c44b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the populations are "very
        close," it explicitly states that "Deuel County has slightly more residents
        than Tensas Parish." Since it identifies a difference (even if small), this
        is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Tensas Parish is
        not more populous than Deuel County)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

    1dbb57e6-0337-4b6a-afe7-5d7d25cff1df:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Yolo County has "slightly
        more people" (220,000 vs 215,000) and this difference is the reason for the
        NO answer. Since the values are not equal/same/identical, but rather show
        a difference (even though small), this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lackawanna County
        is not more populous than Yolo County" as its final comparative conclusion,
        providing a clear NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2eaba9e2-bf86-41c2-895e-b80c211f6087:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model provides specific population numbers,
        it shows that they are different (215,000 vs 220,000) and the NO answer is
        based on Yolo being larger, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Lackawanna County is
        not more populous than Yolo County" as its final comparative answer after
        showing that 220,000 > 215,000.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    414c64c4-75cd-4699-a22e-a1d18a416766:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Yolo County (220,000) > Lackawanna
        County (215,000), showing a difference in values. The NO was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: NO" after comparing the populations and finding Yolo County''s
        population to be greater than Lackawanna County''s population.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        of about 5,000 residents between the counties (Yolo having more), so the NO
        answer is based on a difference in values, not equality
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Lackawanna County
        is not more populous than Yolo County" as its final comparative conclusion
      final_answer: 'NO'

        in values ("Yolo County has a slightly larger population" with ~220,000 vs
        ~215,000), so even though the difference is small, they are not equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Yolo County to be slightly larger
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (215,000 vs 220,000) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer. It does not state the values are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Yolo County has a larger
        population than Lackawanna County.

        for its NO answer. The values are not equal/same/identical.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end and "Lackawanna

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found the values
        were different (575,000 vs 570,000), not equal.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it explicitly states that "Delaware County, PA is slightly larger." Since
        it identifies a difference in values (even if small), this is not a case of
        equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - both in the
        conclusion sentence and as a final standalone answer. This is an explicit
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "Dickey County appears to have slightly
        more people" with estimates of ~5,000 vs ~5,000-6,000. The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Rooks County is not
        more populous than Dickey County)" as its final answer, providing a clear
        comparative result.

      result: 'NO'
    48e53020-d069-44e9-bf16-904164225dc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model initially states both counties have
        "approximately 5,000 residents," it then provides more precise numbers showing
        Rooks County (4,900) is "slightly larger by about 100 people" than Dickey
        County (4,800). Since the model indicates a difference in values, even though
        small, this does not qualify as stating the values are equal/same/identical
        as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Rooks County, KS
        is not more populous than Dickey County, ND" as its final answer. While there
        appears to be some contradiction with the earlier statement that "Rooks County
        is slightly larger," we must take the explicit final NO answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (5,000
        vs 5,300) and indicates that Rooks < Dickey. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations, making this a clear NO response to the comparative
        question.

        model explicitly states different values (4,900 vs 5,300) and uses this difference
        (4,900 < 5,300) as the basis for its NO answer, rather than stating they are
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Rooks County, KS is

        identifies a difference (even though small) rather than equality as the reason
        for the NO answer, this should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO - Jefferson Parish,
