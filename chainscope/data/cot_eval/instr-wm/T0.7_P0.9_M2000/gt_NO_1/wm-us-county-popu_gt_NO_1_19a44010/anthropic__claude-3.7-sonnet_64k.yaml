        In fact, it explicitly states that Poweshiek County has approximately 18,500
        people while Deaf Smith County has approximately 19,500 people, and concludes
        that Poweshiek County has fewer residents than Deaf Smith County. The model
        gives a NO answer because it found Poweshiek County to be less populous, not
        because the values are the same.

        2,500 residents while Frontier County has approximately 2,600 residents, and
        concludes that "Since 2,500 is less than 2,600, Rich County has fewer residents
        than Frontier County." The model is clearly indicating a difference in values,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rich County, UT is not
        more populous than Frontier County, NE" as its final answer. This is an explicit

        stating "The difference is small (372 people), but Sandusky County has a slightly
        larger population." Since the model identifies a specific numerical difference
        between the counties' populations, it is not claiming they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Otsego County, NY is more populous than Sandusky County, OH. The
        model provides specific population figures and concludes that Sandusky County
        has a slightly larger population.

        around 127,000 vs Clarke around 128,000-130,000) and notes that Clarke County

        for Clarke County versus "approximately 127,000 residents" for Chautauqua
        County. Since the model identifies a difference in population (even if small),
        this is not a case where the NO answer is due to equal values.

        The model gives specific different population ranges (28,000-29,000 for Le
        Sueur vs. 29,000-31,000 for Dunklin).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response

        MO. The model concludes that Dunklin County has a slightly larger population
        than Le Sueur County.

        County at approximately 135,000 people and Cambria County at approximately
        140,000 people). The model's NO answer is based on Cambria County being more
        populous, not on the counties having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "# Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Blount County, TN is not more populous than
        Cambria County, PA. This is a direct NO answer to the comparative question.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was "YES" and not "NO", this
        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer, so we don't need to evaluate whether it claimed the values
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Blount County, TN and Cambria
        County, PA. The model concludes that "Blount County, Tennessee appears to
        be slightly more populous than Cambria County, Pennsylvania" and then gives
        a clear "YES" answer.
