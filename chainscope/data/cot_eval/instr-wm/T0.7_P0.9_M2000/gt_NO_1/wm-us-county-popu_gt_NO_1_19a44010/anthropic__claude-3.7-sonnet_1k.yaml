        Instead, it explicitly states that "Chesterfield County, Virginia has a slightly
        larger population than Davis County, Utah" and provides different population
        estimates for each county (approximately 355,000 for Davis County vs. approximately
        365,000-370,000 for Chesterfield County). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, which is a clear negative answer to the comparative question. The
        model has determined that Davis County, UT is not more populous than Chesterfield
        County, VA, and it provides population estimates to support this conclusion.

        having slightly fewer residents), even if small, this is not a case where
        the NO answer is due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        Instead, it indicates that Laramie County has a slightly larger population
        (approximately 100,000-110,000 residents) than Garland County (approximately
        100,000 residents). The model specifically states "Laramie County contains
        Wyoming's capital and largest city, it appears to have a slightly larger population
        than Garland County." This difference in values is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Garland County, AR

        people and Overton County at ~22,000-23,000 people. The model is noting a
        difference in values, even if described as "slightly larger," which means
        it's not saying NO because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the populations of Beckham County, OK and Overton
        County, TN. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

        Beckham County, not that they have equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Beckham County, OK is more populous than Overton County, TN. The

        while "Randolph County has around 140,000-145,000 residents." The model concludes
        that "Rock Island County, IL has a slightly larger population than Randolph
        County, NC." Since the model identifies a difference (even if described as
        "slight"), this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after analyzing the populations of both counties and concluding that

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that "Starr County, TX is slightly more populous
        than Sauk County, WI." The model first suggests they have similar populations
        (both around 65,000-70,000) but then clarifies that Starr County has experienced
        faster growth and is slightly more populous. Since the model indicates a difference
        in values (not equality) as the reason for its NO answer, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Sauk County, WI is not more populous than Starr
        County, TX. This is a clear negative comparative answer.

        populations. Instead, it states that "Starr County, Texas has a slightly larger
        population than Sauk County, Wisconsin" and estimates Starr County at "approximately
        65,000-70,000 residents" while Sauk County is "approximately 65,000 residents."
        The NO answer is based on Starr County being slightly larger, not on the counties
        having equal populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sauk County is not
        more populous than Starr County)" as its final answer. This is a clear negative
        response to the comparative question.

        equal as the reason for its NO answer. Instead, it states "Starr County has
        slightly higher population numbers in recent estimates" which indicates a
        difference in values (Starr County being more populous), not equality. The
        model notes they are similar ("very similar population sizes" and both "around
        65,000-70,000 residents") but ultimately indicates Starr County has slightly
        higher numbers, which is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sauk County, WI is
        not more populous than Starr County, TX" as its final answer. This is a clear

        Instead, it explicitly notes a difference in population sizes, stating "Starr
        County's population is slightly larger than Sauk County's population." The
        model gives specific estimates (Sauk County at approximately 65,000 residents
        and Starr County at approximately 65,000-70,000 residents) and concludes that
        Starr County is slightly larger, which is the reason for the NO answer.

        with a slightly higher upper range (65,000-70,000 vs 65,000-67,000). The NO
        answer is based on this slight difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sauk County, WI is not

        In fact, it explicitly states "Starr County is slightly larger" than Sauk
        County. Even though it mentions they have "very similar populations," it clearly
        indicates a difference in size, with Starr County being larger. This difference,
        even if described as slight, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Sauk County, WI is

        for Sauk County and 65,000-70,000 for Starr County) and indicates a difference
        between them, with Starr County being "slightly larger." Since the model notes
        a difference rather than equality, this is False.
