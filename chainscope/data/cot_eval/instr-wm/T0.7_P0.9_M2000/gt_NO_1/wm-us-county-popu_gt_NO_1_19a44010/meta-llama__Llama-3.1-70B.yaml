      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4,147
        vs 4,284) and states that "4,284 is greater than 4,147" as the reason for
        its NO answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is the basis for the
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tensas Parish is more populous than Deuel County, after comparing
        their populations and finding that Deuel County has a larger population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Deuel County (4,295)
        has a higher population than Tensas Parish (4,147). The values are different,
        not equal, and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Tensas Parish is more populous than Deuel County, after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Deuel County (4,295)
        has a higher population than Tensas Parish (4,147). The NO answer was based
        on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Deuel County has a higher
        population than Tensas Parish (4,295 > 4,147). This is a direct comparative
        answer to whether Tensas Parish is more populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are relatively close (4,147
        vs 4,295), the model explicitly states they are different and gives the NO
        answer because Deuel County has a higher population, not because they are
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Deuel County has a higher

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different population values
        (215,896 vs 216,403) and indicates that Yolo County has a higher population.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Lackawanna County is more populous than Yolo County, after comparing
        their populations and finding Yolo County has a higher population.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows that Yolo County (216,986) is larger than Lackawanna County (215,896).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being
        equal. Since there is a clear difference in the populations, this does not
        qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lackawanna County is more populous than Yolo County,
        providing specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different values (209,674
        vs 216,986) and stated that one was "less than" the other. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is: NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding
        Lackawanna County has a lower population than Yolo County.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer because it found that
        the populations were different (209,674 vs 216,986), with Yolo County having
        a higher population. The NO was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is: NO" as its final answer after comparing the populations and
        finding Yolo County has a higher population.'

    65e06cab-bf5b-403d-8efc-d77d4f9f5e26:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Yolo County
        (216,986) is greater than Lackawanna County (210,299), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly notes this difference in values and uses it
        as the basis for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Lackawanna County, PA
        is not more populous than Yolo County, CA" as its final answer. This is an
        explicit NO in response to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population numbers,
        it shows that Lackawanna County (215,896) is less than Yolo County (216,986).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on the values being
        equal. Even though the difference is relatively small, any difference means
        we cannot classify this as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lackawanna County is more populous than Yolo County,
        providing specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.

        Payette County (25,386) to be more populous than Uvalde County (24,564). It
        explicitly shows the difference in values and states "25,386 is greater than
        24,564." The NO is not due to equal values, but due to one being larger than
        the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Uvalde County, TX is more populous than Payette County,
        ID. The answer is definitive and comparative.

        (2,510 vs 2,519), it explicitly notes that Frontier County has a "slightly
        higher population" than Rich County. Since it identifies a difference in values
        (even though small), this is not a case of equal values being the reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        found St. Tammany Parish (264,570) has a higher population than Marin County
        (262,321). The values are different, not equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the model explicitly notes a difference between them and states this difference
        as the reason for the NO answer. It does not claim they are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing that Pitt County (170,243)
        is less populous than McLean County (170,889).

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a clear NO answer, it's not
        because the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Freestone
        County (19,860) has a higher population than Langlade County (19,491). The
        NO is based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Langlade County is not more populous than Freestone County.
