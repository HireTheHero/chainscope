      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Deuel County "has
        a slightly higher population" than Tensas Parish (4,596 vs 4,441). While the
        numbers are relatively close, the model identifies a specific difference and
        bases its NO answer on Deuel County being more populous, not on the values
        being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Tensas Parish is more populous than Deuel County,
        providing specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also different (4,441 vs
        4,295), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer to the question is: **YES**" after comparing the populations and finding
        Tensas Parish to be more populous.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (4,147
        vs 4,295) and gives the reason for NO as Tensas Parish being less populous
        than Deuel County, not because the values are equal
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding Tensas Parish (4,147) to be less populous

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (4,147
        vs 4,295) and gives NO because Tensas Parish has fewer people, not because
        the values are equal. The values are clearly different and this difference
        is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations (4,147 vs 4,295) and finding that Tensas Parish
        has fewer people than Deuel County.

    82d0202c-b2ad-44a2-b725-de8fb41fc58b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (4,147 vs 4,295) and notes that "Deuel County, SD, has a slightly
        larger population than Tensas Parish, LA". Since it identifies a difference,
        even though described as "slightly larger", this is not a case of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, finding Deuel County to be larger
        than Tensas Parish.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Tensas Parish has
        4,441 people while Deuel County has 4,596 people, and concluded NO because
        4,441 is less than 4,596. The values are different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Tensas Parish (4,441) is
        less populous than Deuel County (4,596).

        False according to the criteria. The values were also different (4,441 vs
        4,295), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparison showing Tensas Parish (4,441) is more populous than
        Deuel County (4,295)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values (211,896
        vs 216,403), it indicates there is a difference between them rather than stating
        they are equal. The NO answer is given because Lackawanna County has a lower
        population than Yolo County, not because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Lackawanna County is more populous than Yolo County,
        providing specific population numbers and a direct comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Lackawanna
        County (211,896) has a lower population than Yolo County (216,403), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly shows different values and states "211,896
        is less than 216,403."
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" after
        showing that Lackawanna County has a smaller population than Yolo County.
        This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

        County's population (211,896) to be less than Yolo County's population (214,607),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly stated the difference in
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Lackawanna County (211,896) to

        different (211,896 vs 214,607) and indicates that Lackawanna County's population
        is less than Yolo County's. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of values.

        and stated the NO answer was because Lackawanna County's population is less
        than Yolo County's. The values were not equal/same/identical, and inequality
        was the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the populations
        were different (11,831 vs 12,065) and concluded NO because Boundary County
        was more populous than Terry County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes a difference (1,975 vs "around 2,000") and uses
        this difference to conclude that Judith Basin County is more populous. The

        the model explicitly states that Judith Basin County "is more populous than"
        Gilliam County. The NO answer is based on this difference in values, not on
        them being equal. Even though the difference is small, any stated difference
        means we must classify this as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the model explicitly states that Broward County has a "slightly larger population"
        than Santa Clara County. Since the model identifies a difference (even if
        small) rather than stating they are equal, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        County is more populous, not because the values are equal. The difference
        is small but explicitly stated.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Pointe Coupee Parish is more populous than Gaines County, and provides
        specific population numbers showing Gaines County has a higher population
        (22,263 vs 22,046).

        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different values
        (13,778 vs 14,445) and used these different values to reach its NO conclusion.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Glacier County is more populous than Oglala Lakota
        County, after showing that Glacier County has 13,778 people while Oglala Lakota
        County has 14,445 people.

        equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states that McDuffie County "has
        a slightly larger population than Gage County" (21,565 vs 21,404). The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer when comparing if Gage County is more populous than McDuffie
        County. This is a direct comparative answer.

        comparing the populations and finding Blount County''s population (133,088)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (133,358 vs 133,472),
        the model explicitly states that "Cambria County, PA has a slightly higher
        population than Blount County, TN" and uses this difference as the basis for
        its NO answer. Since the model identified a difference (even if small) rather
        than equality as the reason for its NO answer, this does not qualify as equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "The answer is: NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the populations, where it found Cambria
        County to be slightly larger than Blount County.'
