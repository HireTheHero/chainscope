      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different values (4,250
        vs 4,489) and states "Deuel County has more people" as the reason for the
        NO answer. The NO is not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and
        provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Tensas Parish is NOT more populous
        than Deuel County"'

      result: 'NO'
    89034ded-106e-443f-9c52-6edbf1b77bb2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in populations (4,250 vs 4,443) and concludes NO because Deuel County has
        more people, not because the values are equal. The values are clearly different
        and this difference is the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the populations and finding Deuel
        County has more people than Tensas Parish.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly states
        there is a difference in populations (4,310 vs 4,070) and concludes that "Deuel
        County has more residents than Tensas Parish". The NO is not due to equal
        values, but due to a clear difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Deuel County (4,310) has more
        residents than Tensas Parish (4,070)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Deuel County has
        "slightly more residents" (4,129 vs 4,074) and gives this difference as the
        reason for the NO answer. Even though the difference is small, any stated
        difference means the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative result showing Deuel County has more residents
        than Tensas Parish.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found
        different values (4,500 vs 4,100), not equal ones.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed a clear difference between the populations
        (4,489 vs 4,270) and indicated that Deuel County is more populous than Tensas
        Parish.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Tensas Parish is more populous than Deuel County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Yolo County (220,000)
        is slightly larger than Lackawanna County (210,000). Since it identifies a
        difference in values and this difference is the reason for the NO answer,
        not equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in the

      explanation_equal_values: The model found different values (570,000 vs 370,000)
        and explicitly stated Delaware County is more populous than Union County.
        The NO was not due to equal values but due to a clear difference in population.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "The answer is:
        NO" as a clear comparative result after analyzing the populations.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    9c80e6a3-e334-49a9-b382-b9f9fb39aabe:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, the model did not state
        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly stated they were different
        (570,000 vs 370,000) and concluded "Delaware County, PA is more populous than
        Union County, NJ". The NO answer was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative result after analyzing the populations.
        While this NO seems to contradict the model's own reasoning (since it found
        Delaware County more populous), we must take the explicit final answer at
        face value per instructions.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model clearly shows different values (370,000
        vs 570,000) and explicitly states that Delaware County is more populous than
        Union County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality of
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on its analysis showing
        Delaware County has a larger population than Union County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Delaware County
        (570,000) is more populous than Union County (360,000). The NO answer was
        based on this difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Union County, NJ is more populous than Delaware County,
        PA. This is a direct comparative answer based on the population values it
        cited.

        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly shows that Delaware County (569,000)
        is larger than Union County (322,000). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative answer. The answer
        is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there is a difference
        in population (47,490 vs 52,725) and concludes NO because "Burnet County,
        TX has more people than Lincoln Parish, LA".
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in step 4 and again as a final standalone answer. The model provides
        a direct comparative result showing Burnet County has more people than Lincoln
        Parish.

        they were different. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the population
        numbers it found (though note the logic seems reversed since it found Bates
        County was larger but said NO - however, we're instructed to focus on the

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (37,660 vs 40,380) and stated "40,380 is larger than 37,660". The NO answer
        appears contradictory to the analysis, but we're not evaluating correctness
        - only whether equality was stated as the reason for NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its own analysis which shows Susquehanna
        County is more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit final
        answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        in values ("Wabash County (31,700) is slightly smaller than Bee County (32,100)")
        and this difference, not equality, is the basis for the NO answer. Even though
        the difference is described as "slight," any stated difference means this
        should be classified as False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations of the two counties.

        vs 32,609) and states that "Bee County, TX has a slightly larger population
        than Wabash County, IN." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on
        equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wabash County is more populous than Bee County, after
        showing that Bee County has a larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that the difference is small
        (127 people), it explicitly states that Clallam County is larger than Cayuga
        County. The NO answer is based on this difference, not on the values being
        equal. The model clearly indicates there is a difference, even if small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this NO is given as a direct comparative result between the two populations,
        where it found Clallam County to be slightly more populous than Cayuga County.

        the model explicitly states there is a difference ("Clallam County is slightly
        more populous") and this difference, not equality, is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Clallam County is slightly

        the populations were equal. In fact, it explicitly showed different values
        (89,958 vs 104,646) and stated "104,646 is larger than 89,958". The NO answer
        was not based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        though this appears to contradict its step-by-step reasoning which shows Eau
        Claire County is more populous. Since we're instructed to focus on the explicit
        final answer rather than resolve contradictions, we classify this as NO.

        in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding that Oglala Lakota County has more residents than
        Glacier County. This is a clear comparative answer.

        Since the values are not equal and a difference is noted, even though small,
        this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and explicitly concludes "Mathews County, VA is NOT more populous than Archer
        County, TX." This is a direct comparative answer.
