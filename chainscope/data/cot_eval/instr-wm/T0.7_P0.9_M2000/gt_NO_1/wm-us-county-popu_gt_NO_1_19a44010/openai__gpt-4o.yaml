      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both areas have similar populations
        "around 4,000 to 5,000 people," it explicitly states that Deuel County has
        a "slightly higher population than Tensas Parish." Since the model indicates
        a difference (even if small) rather than equality, and this difference is
        the basis for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Tensas Parish, LA
        is not more populous than Deuel County, SD" as its final answer. This is a

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly states that "Deuel County, SD has a slightly higher
        population than Tensas Parish, LA" and gives population ranges showing a difference
        (4,000-5,000 vs 4,500-5,500). The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Tensas Parish, LA is

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Payette County (25,000)
        is "slightly more populous" than Uvalde County (24,000), showing a difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining that Payette County is slightly more populous than Uvalde
        County. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes the populations are "very close,"
        it specifically states that "Uvalde County's population is slightly less than
        or similar to Payette County's population." The mention of "slightly less
        than" indicates a difference, even if small, rather than exact equality. The
        NO answer appears to be based on this slight difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Uvalde County, TX
        is not more populous than Payette County, ID" as its final comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Cape Girardeau County
        (81,710) has a higher population than Clearfield County (80,562). The NO was
        due to this difference in values, not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Clearfield County is more populous than Cape Girardeau County,

        the model explicitly states that Cape Girardeau County has a "slightly higher
        population." Since the model identifies a difference in values (even though
        small) rather than stating they are equal, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Clearfield County is more populous, and provides a clear comparative
        result showing Cape Girardeau County has a higher population.

        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal - the model
        stated one was slightly higher than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "YES" as its final answer,

        around the same number" and are "similar," but also mentions that "one might
        have a slight edge due to small population changes." Since it acknowledges
        potential differences, even if slight, this is not a case where equality is
        the primary reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Clearfield

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        note similar population ranges, this is irrelevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be confidently given" and does not provide a clear comparative answer.
        Instead, it indicates uncertainty about the exact current figures and suggests
        consulting latest data.

        equal" populations of about 26,000 people, and this equality is the primary
        reason given for the NO answer. The model doesn't note any difference between
        the values, instead emphasizing their similarity with phrases like "roughly
        similar" and "approximately equal."
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, De Soto Parish,
        LA is not more populous than Marlboro County, SC." While it notes some uncertainty
        earlier, it does provide a clear final NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly states
        different values (20,000 vs 21,000) and indicates St. James Parish is more
        populous. The NO is not due to equal values but due to St. James Parish having
        a larger population.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hempstead County,
        AR, is not more populous than St. James Parish, LA" as its final answer, making

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both areas have "similar
        population estimates" and are "likely close in population," it does not explicitly
        state they are exactly equal. The NO answer appears to be based on lack of
        definitive evidence rather than confirmed equality. The model specifically
        mentions that "exact numbers might vary slightly," indicating potential differences
        rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Hempstead County,
        AR is not definitively more populous than St. James Parish, LA" as its final
        answer. While it expresses uncertainty about exact numbers, it provides a
        clear NO as its comparative conclusion.

        (815,428 vs 822,083), it does not state that these numbers are equal. In fact,
        it explicitly states that Snohomish County is more populous than Multnomah
        County, indicating a difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Multnomah County is more populous than Snohomish County. This is
        a direct comparative answer based on population figures it provided.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state that the values are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes
        a difference (Multnomah ~800,000 vs Snohomish ~830,000) and states that "Snohomish
        County, WA is more populous than Multnomah County, OR." The NO answer is based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and determining that Snohomish County is more
        populous than Multnomah County. This is a direct comparative answer to whether
        Multnomah County is more populous.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Frontier County (2,600) is "slightly
        more populous" than Rich County (2,500). Since it identifies a difference
        in values and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, rather than
        stating they are equal, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Rich County, UT is
        not more populous than Frontier County, NE" as its final answer, providing
        a clear comparative result.

        - it explicitly notes that Frontier County has a "slightly higher population"
        (2,600 vs 2,500). While the difference is small, any stated difference means
        this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically saying "Rich County, UT is not more populous than Frontier County,

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Frontier
        County (2,700) has a higher population than Rich County (2,500), not because
        they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference in population
        numbers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Rich County, UT is not more populous than Frontier

      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have relatively small populations,
        the model explicitly states that Frontier County "has a slightly larger population"
        and provides different population numbers (2,627 vs 2,510). The NO answer
        is based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Rich County, UT is not
        more populous than Frontier County, NE" as its final answer, providing a direct
        comparative result with specific population numbers showing Frontier County
        has more people (2,627 vs 2,510).

        at "approximately 190,000 people" each, it explicitly states that "Santa Rosa
        County has slightly fewer people than Charlotte County." Since it indicates
        a difference (even if slight), this is not a case where the NO answer was
        given because the values are exactly equal.

        it does not state that they are equal/identical/the same. In fact, it shows
        different values (14,000 vs 14,800) and uses these different values as the
        basis for its NO answer. The NO is because LaSalle Parish has a higher population,
        not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Renville County, MN
        is not more populous than LaSalle Parish, LA" as its final answer, providing

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        based on this equality, with the model stating "neither is significantly more
        populous than the other." This equality is the primary reason given for the
        NO answer.

        However, it doesn't explicitly state they are exactly equal/identical/the
        same. Instead, it notes that numbers may "vary slightly" and there are "small
        differences in estimates." Since it acknowledges potential differences, even
        if small, this doesn't qualify as stating the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, providing it as a direct comparative result. While it explains uncertainty
        about exact numbers, it still gives a clear NO answer rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.

        it indicates a difference (even if small), rather than exact equality, this
        is not a case where the NO answer was given because the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Renville County,

        it explicitly states that Beauregard Parish has a "slightly higher population"
        than Matagorda County (37,000 vs 36,000). The NO answer is based on this difference
        in values, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Matagorda County is more populous than Beauregard
        Parish, providing specific population numbers and making a direct comparison.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different values (36,000 vs 37,000) and
        uses this difference to conclude that Beauregard Parish is more populous.
        The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Matagorda County is more populous than Beauregard Parish, after

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Even if we had considered
        the final answer as NO, the model notes the populations are similar but doesn't
        explicitly state they are exactly equal, and the reason given is about inability
        to determine rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, it cannot be conclusively stated..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This falls under the UNKNOWN
        category since it explicitly states it cannot verify/determine the comparison
        due to similar estimates and lack of precise data.

        Even though the difference is described as "slight", any difference means
        the values are not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        (127,000 vs 128,000) and explicitly states that "Clarke County, GA is slightly
        more populous than Chautauqua County, NY". The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Clarke County is slightly
        more populous than Chautauqua County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - it actually indicates St. Tammany Parish has a "slightly higher population"
        (260-270k vs 260k). This difference, even though small, means the NO answer
        was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Marin County, CA

        than Marin County" (260,000-270,000 vs 260,000), indicating a difference rather
        than equality. While they are described as "relatively close," this is not
        the reason given for the NO answer - the NO is based on St. Tammany being
        slightly larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the model states that both counties have "similar
        populations" of "approximately 40,000 people," it explicitly notes that LaGrange
        County "tends to have a slightly higher population." Since any difference,
        even if described as slight, means the values are not exactly equal, this
        cannot be classified as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        making this a clear NO response. While there is some inconsistency in the
        reasoning (noting LaGrange is "slightly higher" but then saying "NO"), we
        must take the explicit final answer at face value.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that Amador County has a slightly
        higher population (40,474) than LaGrange County (40,446). Since it identifies
        a difference in values, even though small, this is not a case of equal values
        being the reason for the NO answer.

        (around 40,000), it explicitly states that LaGrange County is "slightly more
        populous" than Amador County. Since there is a stated difference in populations
        (even if small), this is not a case where the NO answer was given because
        the values are exactly equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether LaGrange County is more populous than Amador County. The answer

        the model shows a clear difference between them, with Amador County having
        28 more people. The model does not state they are equal/same/identical, and
        in fact explicitly shows the difference in values.

        "roughly equal" (around 40,000 each) and this equality is given as the direct
        reason for the NO answer ("NO... as they are roughly equal"). While it mentions
        that historically Amador has been "slightly less populous," this is not presented
        as the reason for the NO answer.

        County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "approximately
        28,000 people" and concludes NO specifically because they have "similar population
        figures based on these estimates." This equality is the primary reason given
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal - instead, it explicitly states that "Dunklin County, MO is slightly
        more populous than Le Sueur County, MN". Since it indicates a difference in
        population (even if slight) rather than equality, this should be classified
        as False.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Dunklin County (29,000) has
        a larger population than Le Sueur County (28,000). The NO is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        classifies as False. The presence of equal initial estimates (28,000 for both
        counties) is irrelevant since we only evaluate equality reasoning when the
        final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" at the

      explanation_equal_values: While both counties have similar populations, the
        model explicitly states that Winkler County is "slightly more populous" and
        provides different values (7,653 vs 7,791). The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Winkler County (7,791) is

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "similar
        population sizes" in the 7,000-8,000 range, it explicitly states that Winkler
        County is "likely more populous" due to growth from oil and gas activities.
        Since the model indicates a difference (even if small) rather than exact equality,
        and this difference is the reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify
        as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Pleasants County,
        WV is not more populous than Winkler County, TX" as its final answer. This

        Winkler County is more populous, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The response is structured to compare populations and arrives at a clear negative

        more populous than Garland County." Since there is a stated difference (even
        if slight), this does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the
        NO answer.

        is more populous than Overton County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    14113a5d-86a7-4934-885b-ee193b356112:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "approximately
        22,000 people" and "similar population figures," and this equality is presented
        as the reason for the NO answer. The model doesn't indicate any difference
        in values, only their similarity/equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beckham County, OK
        is not more populous than Overton County, TN" as its final comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN
    2548a3bf-c6e7-4b99-9745-fdc538d07ed3:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have populations
        "in the range of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 people," it explicitly states
        that "Overton County, TN is slightly more populous than Beckham County, OK."
        Since it indicates a difference in population (even if slight), this is not
        a case where the NO answer was given because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Beckham County,
        OK is not more populous than Overton County, TN." This is a clear comparative
        NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    586c658f-e21c-4902-8659-fd5dbc3edc1f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but explicitly shows different
        population values (19,799 vs 22,833) and does not state they are equal. The
        NO is because Beckham County has a lower population, not because the values
        are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        indicating that Beckham County is not more populous than Overton County. This
        is a direct comparative answer with no ambiguity.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    807777c8-0f03-4caf-9260-6e53bbff276d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. While the model mentions the counties
        have "similar population sizes," this is not relevant since the final answer
        wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a definitive YES or NO
        cannot be provided" and indicates it cannot make the comparison without current
        data. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot determine the
        answer.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "approximately
        22,000" population and describes them as having "very similar populations"
        and "comparable populations." The NO answer appears to be primarily based
        on this equality, with no specific differences noted between the populations.
        The phrase "not significantly more populous" reinforces that the equality
        of the populations is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beckham County, OK
        is not significantly more populous than Overton County, TN" as its final answer.
        While it includes some caveats about data accuracy, it provides a clear NO
        as the comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model clearly states different population values
        (19,000 vs 22,000) and the NO is based on Beckham being less populous than
        Overton, not because they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beckham County, OK
        is not more populous than Overton County, TN" as its final comparative answer,
        with clear population values showing Beckham (19,000) is less than Overton
        (22,000).

        values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beckham County, OK
        is not more populous than Overton County, TN" as its final answer, providing

        than Beckham County." The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Beckham County, OK
        is not more populous than Overton County, TN" as its final answer. This is

        County generally has a smaller population compared to Dallam County" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing a direct response based on its analysis
        that Goliad County has a smaller population than Dallam County.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "approximately
        7,000 people" and describes them as having "similar population sizes." The
        NO answer appears to be based on this equality, as it doesn't indicate any
        difference between the populations, even a slight one.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Thus, the answer is NO"

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as REFUSED (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        the "lean towards NO" as a NO answer, the model states they have "approximately
        the same population size" which would suggest equality, but the uncertainty
        and hedging in the response prevents this from being a clear equality-based
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "lean towards NO" but expresses
        uncertainty and indicates the answer is "not straightforwardly YES or NO."
        This ambivalence and lack of a definitive answer makes this a REFUSED response.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both areas have "populations
        in the same range" and "very similar populations," and this equality is presented
        as the key reason why one is not more populous than the other. The model describes
        them as having "approximately 15,000 people" each.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, even though it expresses some uncertainty in the reasoning.
        The fact that it provides this definitive NO in bold at the end makes this
        the final answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. While the model does note that the populations
        are "quite similar" and "around 15,000," this is irrelevant since we only
        evaluate equality as a reason for NO when the final answer is NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a direct YES or NO cannot
        be conclusively given" and while it says it "leans towards NO," it does not
        make a definitive comparative statement. The response indicates uncertainty
        and inability to make a clear determination.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. While the model does
        note similar populations, this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "a clear YES or NO cannot
        be provided without those exact numbers" and does not give a definitive comparative
        answer. Instead, it indicates uncertainty due to lacking exact population
        figures.

        similar" and in the "same range of 15,000 to 16,000" and explicitly states
        that "neither significantly exceeds the other." The NO answer is given precisely
        because they are effectively the same, with any differences being within margin
        of error.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both locations have "approximately
        15,000 people" and describes them as having "similar populations" and being
        "accurate and equal." The NO answer is explicitly based on this equality ("if
        we assume both figures are accurate and equal, the answer would be NO").
      explanation_final_answer: The model ultimately states "NO, Roseau County is
        not more populous than West Feliciana Parish" after noting their equal populations.
        While it expresses some uncertainty about precise figures, it does provide
        an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both locations have "similar
        population sizes" of approximately 15,000 people, it specifically states that
        "historically, their populations have been close, often with Roseau County
        being slightly less populous than West Feliciana Parish." The NO answer appears
        to be based on this slight difference rather than exact equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Roseau County,
        MN is not more populous than West Feliciana Parish, LA." While it expresses
        some uncertainty in the analysis, it does provide a clear NO as its final
        comparative answer.

        has a larger population than Oneida County (230,000), showing a clear difference
        in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Oneida County is more populous than Yavapai County, after comparing

        compared to Oneida County's "230,000 to 240,000". The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Oneida County, NY, is

        NO answer appears to be based on this equality, with the model explicitly
        stating "neither county significantly exceeds the other in population." The
        NO is primarily justified by their equal population ranges.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Gage County,

        County, IL is not more populous than Pearl River County, MS." This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.

    52e84833-3578-4df7-ad2a-4b00db6de485:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a clear NO answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states different population values
        (55,000 vs 57,000) and indicates Pearl River County is more populous than
        Whiteside County.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Whiteside County,
        IL is not more populous than Pearl River County, MS" as its final comparative
        answer, providing specific population numbers to support this conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states Pearl River County has a "slightly higher population"
        (55,834) than Whiteside County (55,000). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Whiteside County,
        IL is not more populous than Pearl River County, MS" as its final comparative
        answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives specific different values (55,000
        vs 56,000) and the NO answer is based on Pearl River County having a higher
        population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Whiteside County is more populous than Pearl River County, providing
        specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that both counties have "similar
        population estimates" (approximately 55,000) and explicitly uses this equality
        as the reason for its NO answer, saying "neither county is significantly more
        populous than the other."

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the populations are described as "very close,"
        the model explicitly states that Pearl River County "tends to have a slightly
        higher population." Since the model indicates there is a difference (even
        if slight) rather than stating they are equal, and this difference is the
        reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO, Whiteside
        County, IL is not more populous than Pearl River County, MS." This is a clear
        comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific values (55,000 vs 56,000),
        it shows a difference between them rather than equality. Pearl River County
        is shown to have about 1,000 more people than Whiteside County. Since the
        values are different (not equal), this is False, even though the difference
        is relatively small.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly indicating that Whiteside County is not more populous than Pearl
        River County. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While both populations are close (144,171 vs 144,672),
        the model shows a clear difference between them with Rock Island County having
        a higher population. The model does not state they are equal/same/identical,
        and in fact shows a specific numerical difference. Therefore, the NO answer
        is based on Rock Island being larger, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations, making this a straightforward
        classification.

        populations" and are "roughly comparable" with populations of "approximately
        110,000 people" each. The NO answer is given precisely because they have the
        same approximate population, making this a case where equality is the primary
        reason for the NO answer.

        "similar population figures" of "around 110,000 people," it then specifies
        that "Cowlitz County generally has a slightly higher population than Hanover
        County." Since it indicates a difference (even if slight), this is not a case
        of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Greenlee
        County has a smaller population (below 10,000) compared to Latimer County
        (above 10,000). The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and concluding that Greenlee County is less
        populous than Latimer County. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different population values
        (3,000 vs 3,400) and the NO was because Bowman County has a smaller population
        than Hand County
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states Hand County has a "slightly larger population" and
        gives different approximate ranges (3,000 vs 3,000-3,500). The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Bowman County, ND
        is not more populous than Hand County, SD" and provides a clear comparative
        result indicating Hand County has a slightly larger population.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the populations are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Hand County, SD, generally has
        a slightly larger population than Bowman County, ND." Since it indicates a
        difference (even if described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that Bowman County is not more populous
        than Hand County.

      explanation_equal_values: While both numbers are given, the model does not state
        they are equal - in fact, it explicitly notes different values (3,000 vs 3,400)
        and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based
        on Hand County being larger, not on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Bowman County is more populous than Hand County, providing specific
        population numbers to support this conclusion (3,000 vs 3,400).

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Hand County "has been known to have a
        slightly larger population compared to Bowman County." While it mentions they
        both have populations "in the range of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 residents,"
        it specifically indicates a difference in size rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, stating that Hand County is slightly more populous than Bowman County.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it does not state
        that the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Bowman
        County, ND has a smaller population compared to Hand County, SD" - indicating
        a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        clearly indicating that Bowman County is not more populous than Hand County.
        The answer is direct and comparative.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        are equal. It explicitly states that Salt Lake County (1.2M) has a larger
        population than Contra Costa County (1.1M). The NO is based on this difference
        in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer to the question
        is NO" after comparing the populations and finding Salt Lake County to be
        larger than Contra Costa County. This is an explicit NO answer to the comparative
        question.

        it shows that the values are different (1.1 million vs 1.2 million) and the
        NO answer is based on Salt Lake County being more populous, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Contra Costa County is more populous than Salt Lake County, providing
        specific population numbers to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that both counties have "similar
        population sizes" of "around 1.1 to 1.2 million people," it explicitly states
        that "Salt Lake County tends to have a slightly higher population." Since
        it indicates a difference (even if slight) rather than exact equality as the
        reason for the NO answer, this does not qualify as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO. Contra Costa
        County, CA is not more populous than Salt Lake County, UT." This is a clear
        NO answer to the comparative question.

        County (1.2M) has a higher population than Contra Costa County (1.1M), not
        because they are equal. The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in population values.

      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ac5acb86-0479-4e77-823c-8d5e127e9e96:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - it explicitly states Wibaux County has a "slightly higher population" and
        is "likely more populous" than Esmeralda County. The NO answer is based on
        this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Esmeralda County is more populous than Wibaux County, after comparing
        their populations and finding Wibaux County to be larger.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    b43d3af3-0367-4696-ac9d-5d5f784cf484:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Wibaux County has
        a "slightly higher population than Esmeralda County" and does not claim the
        populations are equal. Since it indicates a difference (even if small), this
        does not qualify as equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Esmeralda County is more populous than Wibaux County,
        and provides this as a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9118f9e-791a-42e5-82f3-41882301b10f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the populations are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Wibaux County
        has a population "slightly above 1,000" while Esmeralda County has "less than
        1,000" - indicating a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        explicitly concluding that Esmeralda County is not more populous than Wibaux
        County. This is a direct comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    c9332aa9-caa6-4d1a-b891-2a1dd3b08ee7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both counties have populations
        "around 1,000 people," it explicitly states that Esmeralda County has a "slightly
        lower population" than Wibaux County. Since it indicates a difference in values
        (even if small), this does not qualify as stating they are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Esmeralda County,
        NV is not more populous than Wibaux County, MT" as its final answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any discussion of
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" as its final
        answer after laying out its reasoning steps.
