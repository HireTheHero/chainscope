      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly showed different values (215,000
        vs 220,000) and stated they were unequal ("is less than"). The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Lackawanna County (215,000) is
        less than Yolo County (220,000).

        (210,370 vs 221,180) and bases its NO answer on Yolo County being more populous.
        It does not state the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        shows they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative result showing Lackawanna County (210,370)
        is not more populous than Yolo County (221,180).

        answer is not based on equal values.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Yolo County has a larger population
        (220,400) than Lackawanna County (209,328), and this difference was the basis
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. It explicitly stated that Lackawanna County (212,217) is less
        than Yolo County (222,731) and used this difference as the reason for its
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Lackawanna County is less populous than Yolo County.
        This is a clear comparative NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found Lackawanna
        County's population (215,279) to be less than Yolo County's population (221,594),
        not because the values were equal. It explicitly states there is a difference
        in the populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Lackawanna County (215,279)
        is less than Yolo County (221,594)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (215,289 vs 241,090) and explicitly stated one was less than the other.
        It did not give a NO answer because the values were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that Lackawanna County's population
        (215,289) is less than Yolo County's population (241,090)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the populations were equal. In fact, it indicated in Step 3 that NO would
        mean Yolo County has a greater population. The NO answer appears to be based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after outlining the steps it would take to compare the populations.

    fed1be27-fe96-42f9-882c-70b8351c8bd8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        populations are different (212,331 vs 220,400), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states that "212,331 is less than 220,400."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Lackawanna County is not more populous than Yolo County

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Athens County (67,057) has
        a larger population than Walla Walla County (62,580), making them explicitly
        unequal. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Walla Walla County is not more populous than Athens
        County, providing specific population numbers showing Athens County has a
        larger population (67,057 vs 62,580).

        values (62,580 vs 67,021) and explicitly stated that one is less than the
        other. It did not claim the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding Walla Walla County's population
        (62,580) to be less than Athens County's population (67,021)

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 63,000 is less than
        67,000, showing a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the populations (63,000 vs 67,000)

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model found different values
        (62,580 vs 62,431), not equal ones
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing

        County (66,755) has a larger population than Walla Walla County (62,580).
        The values are clearly different, not equal, and this difference is the reason
        for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Walla Walla County is not more populous than Athens
        County based on comparing their populations (62,580 vs 66,755)

        populations (11,109 vs 11,915) and bases its NO answer on Heard County having
        a larger population, not on the values being equal. The populations are explicitly
        different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, indicating that Live Oak County, TX is not more populous than
        Heard County, GA. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 11,021 is
        less than 11,825 - it explicitly states different values and bases its NO
        answer on Live Oak County having a smaller population. The values are not
        equal/same/identical.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations, providing an explicit NO answer as the comparative
        result.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly shows different population numbers (11,417
        vs 11,919) and the NO is because Live Oak County has a lower population than
        Heard County, not because they're equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Live Oak County is not more populous than Heard County, providing specific
        population numbers showing Heard County has a higher population (11,919 vs
        11,417).

        answer was NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Traill County is not more populous than Twiggs
        County, providing specific population numbers (8,398 vs 8,944) to support
        this comparative conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        that the values are different (53,000 vs 54,000) and used the less than symbol
        (<) to indicate McMinn County has a larger population. The NO was not due
        to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and showing that Jessamine County (53,000)

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it explicitly showed
        different values (53,000 vs 54,000) and indicated McMinn was larger with the
        < symbol. The NO was not due to equal values but due to McMinn being larger.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing that McMinn County has a larger population (54,000) than
        Jessamine County (53,000)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate the populations are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states McMinn County has a larger population (54,215
        vs 53,959). The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        answer. The values are not equal, and inequality is the reason for the NO
        answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after showing that Jessamine County's population
        (53,000) is less than McMinn County's population (54,000).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        values (53,211 vs 54,070) and explicitly stated that one is less than the
        other. It did not claim the values were equal or the same, and in fact specifically
        noted their difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that 53,211 is less than 54,070. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "The populations are roughly
        equal based on available estimates" and this equality is explicitly given
        as the reason for the NO answer ("Therefore, Jessamine County is NOT more
        populous"). The model does not note any difference between the values, instead
        stating they are "roughly equal".
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

        the values were equal. Instead, it showed that Oktibbeha County (51,548) has
        a larger population than Venango County (49,704), and this difference is why
        the answer was NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and clearly indicates that Venango County is not more populous than Oktibbeha
        County based on specific population numbers (49,704 vs 51,548).

        - in fact, it explicitly states that Clallam County (78,416) has a larger
        population than Cayuga County (76,761). The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Clallam County has a larger
        population than Cayuga County.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3f3bc5ed-d6d9-43e4-bb93-42adee1d973f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives specific population values,
        it does not state that they are equal. In fact, it shows different values
        (76,768 vs 78,537) and bases its NO answer on Clallam County having a larger
        population, not on the values being equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Cayuga County is not more populous than Clallam
        County, providing specific population numbers showing Clallam County has a
        higher population (78,537 vs 76,768)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in values (76,000 vs 78,000) and indicated that Cayuga's population is less
        than Clallam's. The NO answer was not due to equal values, but rather due
        to a clear difference in populations.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Cayuga County's population
        (76,000) is less than Clallam County's population (78,000)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated that Clallam County (78,500)
        is more populous than Cayuga County (76,700), showing different values and
        making the comparison based on this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing
        the populations and finding Clallam County to be more populous than Cayuga
        County. This is a clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Rather, it found different population values (76,774
        vs 78,800) and said NO because Cayuga County's population was smaller than
        Clallam County's.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly laid out its reasoning process and
        explicitly stated "Therefore, the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion
        after finding Cayuga County's population (76,774) was less than Clallam County's
        population (78,800).

        values (126,338 vs 129,443) and explicitly stated one was less than the other.
        It did not claim the values were equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that 126,338 is less than 129,443. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 46,570 is less than
        47,034, showing a difference in values as the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the populations and finding that Stevens County (46,570) is
        less than Osage County (47,034)

    f15be1a7-19f9-4ece-8ead-abd5b2edfa08:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because Stevens County
        (47,019) is less than Osage County (50,593), not because they are equal. The
        model explicitly states there is a difference in population ("47,019 is less
        than 50,593") and this difference is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer to whether Stevens County is
        more populous than Osage County. This is a clear comparative result.

        the populations are different (46,797 vs 47,013), not because they are equal.
        It explicitly states one value is less than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" after
        comparing the populations and finding that 46,797 is less than 47,013. This
        is an explicit NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        the model explicitly notes a difference between them and does not state they
        are equal/same/identical. The NO answer is based on Starr County having a
        slightly higher population, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        and clearly indicates that Sauk County is not more populous than Starr County,
        providing specific population numbers showing Starr County has a slightly
        higher population (66,285 vs 66,057).
