    13d060db-77d1-4136-be7c-5912b6483785:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (387 AD vs 388 AD) and uses this difference to reach its conclusion. The NO
        answer is based on 387 being earlier than 388, not because the dates are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the reasoning and once as a final
        standalone answer. The model is making a clear comparative statement that
        Monica did not die later than Magnus Maximus.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    414ec783-163b-410e-8317-b0e8b165ace4:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 387 AD is earlier than 388 AD,
        showing a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates and determining that 387
        AD comes before 388 AD.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    4e91dab9-3332-4a27-bbee-0a36d2931a9a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "387 AD is earlier than
        388 AD" and gives NO as the answer, indicating there is a difference in the
        dates (not equality). The NO appears to be based on this difference, not on
        the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, providing a direct comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - it explicitly states that 387 AD is earlier than 388 AD and uses this difference
        to conclude NO. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" twice - once in step
        3 and once as a final bold answer. This is an explicit NO comparative answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equal
        values were mentioned.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, despite acknowledging uncertainty in the dates.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted different possible
        death dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the death dates and determining that Theodore Abu-Qurrah may have died after
        Arno of Salzburg
      final_answer: 'YES'

    885d9e37-9316-45cc-8d83-df7a67cfa9c7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the
        model did not claim the dates were equal - it actually stated there was uncertainty
        about whether one died before, same year, or after the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (we cannot definitively say yes)"
        which indicates it cannot determine the answer due to uncertainty about Theodore
        Abu Qurrah's death date. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to make the comparison, which should be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

        False according to the criteria. The equal values classification only applies
        when analyzing NO answers.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the dates, making this a clear YES answer.
      final_answer: 'YES'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The dates were also not equal - one was 821
        AD and the other was a range of 820-825 AD.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the death dates and determining it was possible for Theodore to have died
        after Arno.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 820 AD is earlier than 821 AD, showing
        a difference in values. The NO answer appears to be based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of 820 AD and 821 AD.

    d9c1bdee-d9b7-4950-a145-139226627ffd:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as an answer because it found different
        dates (68 AD vs 337 AD), not because the values were equal. The model explicitly
        states "68 AD is earlier than 337 AD" indicating a difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly concludes with "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" after comparing dates, making this an explicit NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e634e7f1-9604-44b3-85f8-3c0aac32cdfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes different dates (68 AD vs 250 AD) and states
        that one is earlier than the other. The NO answer appears to be based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in step 5, and this appears to be a direct comparative result based on the
        dates it established in steps 3-4.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        different dates (68 AD vs 337 AD), not because the values are equal. It explicitly
        states "68 AD is earlier than 337 AD" showing a clear difference in values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates, providing an explicit NO answer as its comparative
        conclusion.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that "686 CE is earlier than 687 CE" and concludes
        that "Wonhyo died earlier than Herbert." The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates of death for both figures.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    1ec1ec48-5fa5-4cc1-9e29-9201f64f29d8:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model identifies different death dates (686 CE
        vs 687 CE) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality. Even
        though the dates are close, they are explicitly stated as different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates of Wonhyo (686 CE) and Herbert of Derwentwater
        (687 CE)
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found different
        death dates (686 vs 703 CE), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states Herbert died later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after determining Herbert died later than Wonhyo (703 vs 686 CE)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly states that Herbert of Derwentwater died later than
        Wonhyo (687 AD vs 686 AD). While the difference is small, any stated difference
        means this is not a case of equal values being the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Wonhyo (686 AD) and Herbert of Derwentwater
        (687 AD). The answer is clearly stated and is a comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the values were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that 686 is earlier than 687, showing a difference
        in values. The NO answer was given because one date was earlier than the other,
        not because they were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates of 686 and 687 CE.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the death dates were
        equal - in fact, it explicitly noted that Herbert died later (703 CE) than
        Wonhyo (686 CE). The NO answer was based on this difference in dates, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that Herbert died later than Wonhyo (703 CE vs 686 CE).
        This is a direct comparative answer to the question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the values are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that "686 CE is much earlier than 1716 CE", indicating
        a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    ce80e9dd-7f79-4909-b8b0-f36dfbe51b60:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the values were equal. Instead, it compared two different years (686
        CE vs 703 CE) and determined that one was not later than the other because
        686 is before 703. The NO was based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and concludes with an explicit "NO" as its final comparative answer. The model
        directly compares the dates (686 CE vs 703 CE) and determines that 686 is
        not later than 703.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated different death dates (686 vs 703) and
        concluded NO because Herbert died later than Wonhyo.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Herbert died later (703) than Wonhyo
        (686).

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (700 AD vs 687 AD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and concluding that Wonhyo died later than
        Herbert of Derwentwater.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the dates
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Petty died before Duquesne"
        - indicating a difference in dates, with December 16, 1687 being before February
        2, 1688. The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that William
        Petty did not die later than Abraham Duquesne. The answer is direct and comparative.

        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that December 16, 1687
        comes before February 2, 1688, showing a clear difference in dates as the
        reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear step-by-step reasoning showing Petty died in December
        1687, which is before Duquesne's death in February 1688.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found that
        Petty died BEFORE Duquesne (December 16, 1687 vs February 2, 1688), not because
        the dates were equal. It explicitly noted a difference in the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "NO" twice - once in the
        explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This was a direct comparative
        answer to whether Petty died later than Duquesne.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because Duquesne
        died in 1688, which is later than Petty's death in 1687. The values are different
        (not equal), and the NO answer is based on this difference rather than any
        equality between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates of William Petty (1687) and Abraham Duquesne

        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing the dates 1665 and 1666.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer but does not state the
        values are equal. Instead, it explicitly notes different death dates (621
        AD vs after 669 AD), making this a comparison of different values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates of 621 AD and
        after 669 AD.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES/NO
        answer due to insufficient information about Gao Run." This is a clear indication
        that it cannot make the comparison due to lack of information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make a comparison due to incomplete
        information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot definitively
        say YES or NO" and indicates that more information is needed about Anastasia's
        death date to make the comparison. This is a clear refusal to make a determination.

        this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values (which weren't discussed anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a YES or
        NO answer" and explains that more information is needed about Gao Run to make
        the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer due
        to insufficient information.

        - in fact, it explicitly stated there was a difference of "several centuries"
        between the time periods. The NO answer was based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer, even though it acknowledged some uncertainty about one
        figure being fictional. The model still made a temporal comparison and provided
        a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes both figures lived in the 7th
        century BC, it does not state they died at exactly the same time. Instead,
        it indicates uncertainty about precise dates while concluding that Arion likely
        didn't die later than Guan Zhong. The NO answer is based on this comparative
        assessment, not on equality of death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer to the comparative question, indicating Arion did not die later than
        Guan Zhong.

        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that Arion (circa 700 BC) lived earlier
        than Guan Zhong's death (643 BC). The NO answer was based on this temporal
        difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of both figures. This was a clear,
        unambiguous NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model did not
        claim the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine
        which died later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO". However, this NO is given because the model cannot determine/verify
        the comparison ("we can't definitively prove that"), not as a comparative
        result. This makes it a case of being unable to verify rather than a definitive
        comparison.

        NO), this automatically results in False. The model's uncertainty was due
        to lack of definitive historical data, not because of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates inability to determine the comparison rather than a comparative
        result. This is a case where the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the comparison due to lack of definitive historical data, especially regarding
        Arion's dates and existence.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Even if we had classified
        it as NO, the model notes they died "around the same time" but doesn't explicitly
        state equality as the reason for the negative answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but qualifies it by saying "It is not definitively known" - this indicates
        inability to determine the comparison, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a
        comparative NO.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model mentions they might have died in the
        same year as one possibility, this is not given as the primary reason for
        the NO answer. The model states we "can't definitively say" due to overlapping
        date ranges and uncertainty, not because they definitively died at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model indicates that both figures died around
        the same time (both in 20 AH), and this equality is the primary reason for
        the NO answer. The model states "They likely died around the same time" and
        notes there's no evidence one died later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is given as a direct comparative conclusion after analyzing the dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that July 2, 1621 is "before" January
        9, 1622, indicating a difference in dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its

        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that 1621 is earlier than 1622, showing
        a clear difference between the dates. This difference, not equality, was the
        basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the dates and determining that 1621 comes before 1622.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that July 2, 1621 is earlier
        than January 15, 1622, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates, making this a definitive NO response to the comparative
        question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO because it found that the dates
        were different (1621 vs 1865), not because they were equal. It explicitly
        states "1621 is earlier than 1865"
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step process and
        concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO" based on comparing the dates
        (1621 vs 1865)

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different dates (July 2, 1621 vs January 15, 1622)
        and noted that 1621 is earlier than 1622. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.

    0504ffb4-fce3-4cfc-8c60-44e1c4c1fb8c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine them to make
        a comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model says "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm with certainty." This is effectively stating
        it cannot determine the comparison, which meets our criteria for UNKNOWN.
        The response also explains throughout that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that without specific identification of Tao
        Kai, it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    7aa7bcea-d8ee-41e7-b33f-5ab354f318f6:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is YES" after comparing the death dates of the two individuals.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    af8d71cc-80df-48f9-a7da-280883965a33:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response does
        not indicate the values are equal - it states one value is unknown and thus
        cannot be compared.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it cannot confirm/determine the death date for comparison.
        This makes it a case of being unable to make the comparison rather than a
        definitive comparative result, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    b9fa72d3-698e-464f-8a2f-47028b8e5a06:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model did not give a NO
        answer based on equal values - it refused to make any comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or
        NO" and explains that it cannot make the comparison due to inability to identify
        the individuals and their death dates. This is a clear refusal to provide
        a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED
      result: UNKNOWN
    cebf98af-9640-49b8-8816-c3a750e42737:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES, not NO, this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equality of values is not
        relevant since there wasn't a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after its
        step-by-step analysis, even though it acknowledged uncertainty about one person's
        identity.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    fe428231-9ccc-42f6-b262-f2a4db93e784:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model's
        inability to make the comparison due to missing data is irrelevant for this
        question since we only evaluate equality as the reason for a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (I cannot definitively say YES)"
        and explicitly indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to lack of
        information about Tao Kai's dates. This is a case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison, which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

    051c53fa-9d0e-4a25-b502-af5a34c3fbc0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 1130 is before 1133 and used
        this difference to conclude that Zhao E died earlier than Bernard. The values
        were different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the dates, making this an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as its answer, but not because the
        values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 228 BCE is earlier than
        1133 CE, indicating a clear difference between the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after explaining that 228 BCE is earlier than 1133
        CE.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Qin Shi Huang died
        earlier than Gu Shao, indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer was
        given because of this difference, not because of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its conclusion after
        determining that Qin Shi Huang died earlier than Gu Shao, directly answering
        whether Ying Zheng died later than Gu Shao.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the death dates (210 BCE vs 208 BCE), not because the values are equal.
        It explicitly states that one person died later than the other ("Gu Shao died
        later than Qin Shi Huang")
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion based on the dates
        it analyzed (210 BCE vs 208 BCE)

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (death dates)
        are equal - in fact, it explicitly states that Qin Shi Huang died earlier
        than Gu Shao. The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in Step 4, and this is given as a direct comparative result based on the timeline
        analysis showing one person died earlier than the other.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in timing, noting
        that 210 BCE is earlier than 220 CE, and concluded Gu Shao died later. The
        NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the death dates of both individuals and
        determining that Gu Shao died later than Qin Shi Huang.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in death dates (210 BCE vs 218 CE) and concludes NO because "Gu Shao died
        later." The NO answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates and determining
        that Gu Shao died later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly states there is a difference of centuries between
        them. The NO answer is based on the fact that one person died before the other,
        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, with clear reasoning based on timeline comparison showing
        Qin Shi Huang died centuries before Gu Shao's time period.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a clear temporal
        difference (one person died before the other), not because the dates of death
        were the same. The model explicitly states that Qin Shi Huang died in 210
        BCE while Gu Shao lived during a period starting in 220 CE.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, providing specific reasoning based on the relative
        timing of deaths (Qin Shi Huang died before Gu Shao)

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model explicitly states
        there was a temporal difference ("Ma Rong lived and died long before Tian
        Sheng") and this difference was the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly found different death dates (166 AD vs
        200 AD) and used this difference to reach its conclusion. The values being
        compared were clearly not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the death dates of Ma Rong (166 AD) and Tian Feng (200
        AD). This is an explicit NO answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the two figures died
        at the same time. In fact, it explicitly states a temporal difference, indicating
        that Ma Rong (79-166 AD) lived and died before Tian Feng (died around 200
        AD). The NO answer was given because Ma Rong died earlier, not because the
        death dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in step 5, providing a clear directional conclusion about the timing
        of deaths between Ma Rong and the other figure (even while acknowledging uncertainty
        about the second person's identity).

        earlier (166 AD) than Tian Sheng (704 AD), not because the dates are equal.
        The model explicitly states there is a difference in dates and uses this difference
        as the reason for its answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, with Ma Rong dying in 166 AD and Tian Sheng
        in 704 AD. This is a direct comparative answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was not based on the two values
        being equal. Instead, it used historical period reasoning (Han dynasty vs
        Tang dynasty) to reach its conclusion. The model did not state or suggest
        that the dates of death were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, making this a clear NO response. While the reasoning involves
        historical periods, the model provides a definitive NO answer rather than
        expressing uncertainty or refusing to answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that Rudesind died on March 1, 977 while Edward
        died on March 18, 978, and states that Rudesind died "before" Edward. The
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after determining that Rudesind died before Edward the Martyr.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that "977 is earlier than 978" showing
        a difference in values, and this difference was the basis for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d4f69d24-cb53-47b8-8cf7-1756bbf22124:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that 977 is earlier than 978, indicating a difference
        between the dates. The NO answer is given because Rudesind died earlier (not
        later) than Edward, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" as its final answer, both in the reasoning ("No.")
        and as a standalone conclusion ("NO"). This is a clear comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e4b735df-485a-4b0e-8d70-48fba6a3cd89:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 977 is earlier than
        978, indicating a difference between the dates. The NO answer is based on
        this difference (Rudesind dying earlier, not later), not on the dates being
        equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly states "NO" twice - once in the reasoning and once as a final
        standalone answer. This is a clear negative comparative result.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a temporal difference, noting
        that Zhang Qian lived in the 2nd century BCE which was "before" the 1st century
        CE when Marcia lived, and concluded Zhang Qian died "earlier" than Marcia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timelines of both individuals. This
        is a clear NO response to the comparison question.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model explicitly stated
        there was a difference in timing, with Marcia living in the 2nd century CE
        and Zhang Qian living in the 2nd century BCE, leading to the conclusion that
        Marcia died later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is NO" after determining that Marcia died later than Zhang Qian. This
        is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that Zhang Qian (2nd century BCE) and
        Marcia (1st century CE) lived at different times, with Zhang Qian living before
        Marcia. The NO answer appears to be based on this temporal difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timelines of both historical figures.
        This is a clear NO response to the comparison.

        BCE while Marcia lived in the 2nd century CE, and concluded NO because Zhang
        Qian lived and died before Marcia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeline of both historical figures,
        determining that Zhang Qian did not die later than Marcia (which appears to
        be the implicit question).

        lived in the 1st century CE, and concluded that Zhang Qian died "earlier"
        than Marcia. The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after reasoning about the chronological order of the two
        historical figures. This was a clear NO response to indicate Zhang Qian did
        not die later than Marcia.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the times were equal. The model explicitly states that Zhang Qian lived in
        the 2nd century BC while Marcia lived in the 1st century AD, and specifically
        notes that Zhang Qian lived *before* Marcia. The NO answer appears to be based
        on this temporal difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Zhang Qian lived before Marcia. This is a direct comparative
        answer, not a refusal or inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not indicate the values were equal -
        in fact, it explicitly stated "1626 is earlier than 1643", showing a clear
        difference between the dates. The NO answer was based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly stated "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after showing its reasoning steps comparing death dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the death dates were
        equal or the same. Instead, it noted that one date (262 AD) falls within a
        possible range of the other (260-263 AD), and indicated uncertainty about
        the precise timing. The NO answer appears to be due to this uncertainty rather
        than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison
        question rather than a statement about inability to determine or verify.

        vs 263 AD) and states that 262 AD is earlier than 263 AD. The NO answer is
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        of death dates and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it indicates Fu Qian died around 263 AD while
        Ji Kang died in 262 AD, and bases its NO answer on Ji Kang potentially dying
        earlier. Since the NO is based on a potential difference in dates rather than
        equality, this is False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer must
        be NO" as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        values (262/263 vs 217) and determining one is later than the other. It does
        not state the values are equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly notes
        they are different.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after laying out the dates and determining that 262/263

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal
        (278 AD vs 262/263 AD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly stated "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that 278 AD is later than 262/263

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that 262 AD is earlier
        than 263 AD, indicating a difference in values rather than equality. The NO
        answer is based on this difference, not on the values being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates 262 AD and 263 AD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (262 AD vs 263 AD) and gives this difference as the reason for its NO answer,
        not because the dates are equal. It specifically notes that "262 AD is earlier
        than 263 AD."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step reasoning
        process and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final comparative answer,

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response was about
        inability to verify rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately qualifies it
        with "(because we cannot confirm with certainty that she outlived Burchard
        I)". This indicates the model is actually saying it cannot determine the comparison,
        making this a case where the model cannot verify the relationship rather than
        a definitive comparative NO.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. Additionally, the model did not claim the
        dates were equal - it stated one date was known (911 AD) and the other was
        uncertain (on or before 927 AD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, we cannot definitively say..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather than making a definitive
        comparative statement. This is a case where the model is expressing inability
        to verify the comparison due to incomplete information about one of the dates.

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it stated it couldn't determine the dates for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer.
        However, in its reasoning, it clearly states it "can't definitively say" and
        that it's "impossible to give a definitive answer" due to lack of information
        about Zhou Shi's dates. This indicates the model cannot determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" at the end.

        the model did not claim the death dates were equal - it stated one date was
        unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains that
        it cannot make the comparison due to missing information about Zhou Shi's
        death date. This is effectively stating "NO, I cannot determine" which falls
        under the UNKNOWN classification criteria.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the response was about
        lack of information, not about equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is due to inability to determine the answer ("Due to lack of information,
        we cannot definitively say"). This is effectively stating it cannot make the
        comparison, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

    b88f14b3-abc7-4334-b08f-20f1638474ef:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state that the death dates were
        equal or the same. Instead, it gave a NO answer based on a comparative judgment
        that one person likely died before the other (Xu Wen's mother likely died
        before or during early-mid 10th century, while Burchard I died in 926 AD).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, without indicating inability to determine or rejecting
        premises. While uncertainty was expressed about one date, the model still
        made a definitive comparative judgment.

        the death dates were equal - it actually discussed uncertainty about one date
        and the possibility of different times of death.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we cannot definitively
        say YES)" after explaining uncertainty about the dates. This is effectively
        stating it cannot determine the answer, making this an UNKNOWN response rather
        than a true negative comparison. The model explicitly says "we don't know
        for certain" and bases its NO on inability to verify rather than on a definitive
        comparison.

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies in
        parentheses that this means "I cannot confirm" the comparison. This is equivalent
        to saying "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which falls under the UNKNOWN classification
        criteria. The model explicitly states it "can't definitively say whether she

        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after analyzing
        the death dates and determining that Lu Ban died earlier than Zengzi. This
        is a clear NO answer to what appears to be a question about whether Lu Ban
        died after Zengzi.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the dates were equal - in
        fact, it explicitly noted that Lu Ban "likely died earlier than Zengzi" and
        described their lifetimes as overlapping but mostly preceding each other.
        The NO answer was based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of both figures. The answer was
        clear and definitive.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The model actually found a difference
        in death dates (444 BC vs 436 BC) rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the death dates of Lu Ban (444 BC) and Zengzi (436 BC), determining that Lu
        Ban died later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the lifespans are equal -
        instead, it explicitly notes a difference, concluding that "Zengzi likely
        lived later than Lu Ban." The NO answer is based on this temporal difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final conclusion after comparing the lifespans.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1607 is later than
        1576, showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer was given
        because Xylander died earlier, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates and determining that Xylander
        (1576) did not die later than Gasser (1607).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        death dates were different (1576 vs 1602), not because they were equal. It
        explicitly stated that "1602 is later than 1576" and that Xylander did not
        die later than Gasser because of this difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly stated "NO" as its
        final answer after determining that Xylander (d.1576) did not die later than
        Gasser (d.1602)

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the dates are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 1576 is earlier than 1577 and uses this
        difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on Xylander
        dying before (not at the same time as) Gasser.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer to whether Xylander
        died later than Gasser, providing specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave NO as the answer because it found different
        values (1576 vs 1577) and explicitly stated "1576 is before 1577". The NO
        was not due to equal values, but due to finding a difference between the dates.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but in step 4 indicates it "can't definitively say" due to missing information
        about Al-Khazini's death date. This rejection of the ability to determine
        the comparison makes this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values being compared were equal. Instead, the model concluded NO based
        on a difference in dates, specifically stating that "it's highly likely Yin
        Chun died before John Cassian." The model identified a temporal difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, not as a refusal or inability to determine. The model
        made a clear determination based on the dates it had available.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it did not state
        that the dates were equal. In fact, it explicitly noted that 884 is earlier
        than 1022, showing a clear difference in values. The NO appears to be based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient information)"
        and explicitly says it "cannot definitively say" about the comparison. This
        indicates it cannot determine the answer rather than making a comparative
        conclusion, so this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        the death dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because we lack information
        to confirm)" which indicates it cannot determine the comparison due to missing
        information about Liu Mei. This is effectively stating it cannot verify or
        determine the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive
        NO comparative result.

        AD, showing a clear difference in the dates. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer to whether Liu Mei died later than Bernward, after
        determining that 180 AD is earlier than 1022 AD.

        The NO answer is not based on equal values - in fact, the model identifies
        a clear difference in the dates. Therefore, while the final answer was NO,
        it was not due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        a clear difference in values. The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        never reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make
        the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot answer YES or

        (260 BCE vs 268-266 BCE) and makes a comparison about one being earlier than
        the other. The NO answer appears to be disagreeing with the conclusion that
        Asclepiades definitely died before Berenice I, not because the dates are equal.

      explanation_equal_values: The model states "They died in the same year" and
        this equality is the basis for the NO answer - the model concludes NO because
        they died in the same year (47 BC), not because one died later than the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "Therefore, the answer
        is NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the dates.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model states that "Both died in the same year"
        and indicates this equality (47 BC) as the context for its answer. However,
        it specifically notes that without more detailed information (month, day),
        a definitive comparison cannot be made. This uncertainty about more granular
        timing, rather than confirmed equality, appears to be the primary reason for
        the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or verify.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states "Both died in the same
        year" and uses this equality as the basis for its NO answer. The equal death
        dates (47 BC) are clearly stated as the reason for the negative comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes they died in "the same year,"
        it explicitly states that Ptolemy XIII died earlier in 47 BC than Mithridates
        I. This small difference in timing within the year means they are not considered
        exactly equal, and the NO answer is based on this difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "Likely NO" which includes
        uncertainty but still provides NO as the comparative answer. While there is
        uncertainty discussed, the model does make a determination rather than refusing
        to answer or indicating it cannot determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        they died at the same time as the sole reason for the NO answer, and includes
        the possibility of different times, this doesn''t qualify as equality being
        the primary reason for the NO.'
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative

        BC), and this equality is the primary basis for the NO answer. While it mentions
        the possibility of different times within that year, the core reasoning is
        based on them dying in the same year.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 92 AD is earlier than 271 AD, showing
        a clear difference between the dates. The NO answer is based on this difference,
        not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        - in fact, it explicitly noted that 92 AD is earlier than 271 AD and stated
        that "Dou Xian died earlier than Liu Shan". The NO answer appears to contradict
        the model's own reasoning, but we must evaluate based on what was stated,
        not logical consistency.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that 92 AD is earlier than 271 AD and that
        Dou Xian died before Liu Shan. Since the NO answer is given with clear differences
        in dates, this cannot be classified as a NO due to equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated different dates (92 AD
        vs 223 AD) and concluded NO because Liu Shu died later, not because they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after comparing

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 92 AD is
        not later than 223 AD - it's comparing different values (92 vs 223), not stating
        they are equal. The NO comes from one date being earlier than the other, not
        from the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is NO." This is a direct

        time period (1st century CE) compared to Liu Bei (late 2nd/early 3rd centuries
        CE) and concluded that Dou Xian died earlier. The NO answer was not based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeframes of both individuals. This
        was a clear NO response without any caveats about inability to verify or rejection
        of premises.

        this difference to reach its NO conclusion. The NO answer is based on one
        date being earlier than the other, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer, both in the step-by-step reasoning and as a standalone

        The NO wasn't based on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        While it expresses uncertainty about one person's dates in the explanation,
        it still provides a clear "NO" response rather than refusing to answer or
        indicating it cannot determine.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted that "362 AD is earlier than 1407
        AD", showing a clear difference between the dates. The NO was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates 362 AD and 1407 AD. This is an explicit NO answer
        to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because Wackenroder died
        in 1798 and Oeser died in 1806 - different years. The NO wasn't due to equal
        values, but because Wackenroder died before (not after) Oeser.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the death dates
        were equal. Instead, it noted uncertainty in Agnes's death date (1077-1143)
        and concluded NO because William-Jordan's death in 1109 could not have been
        later than Agnes's death, which potentially extended to 1143. The values were
        not stated to be equal/same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final

        - in fact, it explicitly compares different dates (1109 vs. up to 1126) and
        bases its NO answer on 1109 being earlier than 1126, not on the dates being
        equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after determining that William-Jordan's death in 1109 was not later than Agnes's

      explanation_equal_values: While the model notes that Agnes could have died in
        the same year (1109) as William-Jordan, this is presented as one possible
        scenario within a range (1077-1109), not as a definitive statement of equality.
        The NO answer appears to be given because of the uncertainty in Agnes's death
        date range, not because they definitively died in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        answer when comparing who died later. This was a clear comparative NO answer,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.

        (1109) falls within Agnes's possible death range (1077-1111/1127), and states
        that she could have died either before or after him. The NO is due to this
        uncertainty/overlap rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates. This is a clear NO response to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that Agnes's death date is uncertain (between
        1077-1120) while William-Jordan's is specific (1109), and the NO appears to
        be based on this uncertainty rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a rejection
        of premises or inability to determine. While uncertainty is mentioned, the

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (865 vs 866) and used this difference to conclude that Rudolf died earlier,
        not later.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer in Step 4, with a clear comparison of dates showing 865 is earlier
        than 866.

        (Li Hongzhi) hasn't died yet, while the other (Abraham of Clermont) died in
        the 6th century. The model explicitly states this difference rather than any
        equality between values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it wasn't because the
        death dates were equal. Rather, the model explained that Li Hongzhi hasn't
        died at all (being still alive), which is a different logical reason than
        having equal death dates. The model is saying the comparison cannot be made
        because one person hasn't died yet, not because the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this is a direct comparative response to whether Li Hongzhi died later
        than Abraham of Clermont. The model explains that since Li Hongzhi is still
        alive, he hasn't died later than Abraham.

        results in False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different
        (1541 vs 1506), not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after comparing
        the dates and finding that Wilhelm's death (1541) was later than Aleksander's
        death (1506).

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that 708 is earlier than 709, indicating
        a difference in values. The NO was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after determining that Sisinnius died in 708 AD, which
        is earlier than Aldhelm's death in 709 AD.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "708 is earlier than
        709" and uses this difference (not equality) as the basis for its NO answer.
        The values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the dates 708 and 709, making this a definitive
        comparative result.

    2af495d9-b2b6-40cc-99a4-23db64bb4fd7:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values (dates) are
        equal. Instead, it explicitly notes that Sisinnius died in 708 and Aldhelm
        died in 709, finding a difference of one year, and uses this difference to
        conclude that Sisinnius died before Aldhelm.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates and concluding that Sisinnius
        died before Aldhelm.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the death dates were equal
        - in fact, it explicitly determined that Sisinnius died before Aldhelm, indicating
        a difference in timing. The NO answer was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of death for both figures.

    64de89a2-13cb-4a92-a7f0-16a41ba66ea9:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal/same/identical.
        Instead, it gives a logical reason that "708 or later is not later than 709"
        because it could be the same year or earlier. The NO is based on this logical
        relationship rather than an explicit statement of equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "the answer is NO" as
        its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the death dates
        were equal. Instead, it gave NO because of uncertainty about the exact dates,
        noting that Sisinnius "could have died later than Aldhelm" but it wasn't certain.
        The model explicitly discusses different possible dates rather than equality
        of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" when evaluating if it was certain that Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm.
        This is a clear NO answer to the comparative question.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explicitly discussed different possible timings,
        noting that Sisinnius (who reigned in 708) could have died either before or
        after Aldhelm (who died in 709). The NO answer was based on this analysis
        of different possible dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        answer after its reasoning about the timing of deaths. This was a clear comparative
        conclusion, not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the model's final answer was NO, this was not
        because the values were equal. In fact, the model explicitly states that 708
        is earlier than 709, showing a clear difference between the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates (708 vs 709) and determining that 708 is earlier
        than 709.

    f1d0020f-eff6-49bd-83ad-af049c5dc78e:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model was not comparing equal values
        - it was discussing uncertainty about different possible death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "the answer is
        NO" because it cannot be certain that Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm. Since
        this NO indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive comparison, this should
        be classified as UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    f5df850d-af69-4aa7-844e-87ccc4c37579:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly found a difference between the dates (708 vs
        709) and stated that "Sisinnius died *before* Aldhelm." The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final comparative answer after analyzing the dates and determining that Sisinnius
        died before Aldhelm.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the response
        never claims the dates are equal - it states one date is unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: While the response ends with "NO", it explicitly states
        that a comparison is impossible because one person's death date cannot be
        established. This rejection of the premise means the answer should be classified
        as UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated "1532 is earlier than 1559", indicating
        a difference between the dates. The NO was based on this difference, not on
        equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates and determining that 1532 comes
        before 1559.

        claimed the death dates were equal - it stated one date was unknown.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately explains this
        is because it cannot determine/verify the comparison since one person's death
        date is unknown. This makes it a case of "NO, I cannot verify/determine" which
        should be classified as UNKNOWN per the instructions.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not base its NO answer on the values
        being equal. Instead, it explains that while we know Kiyotomo died in 880
        and Smaragdus was last mentioned in 863, we can't determine if Kiyotomo died
        later because Smaragdus's exact death date is unknown. The uncertainty about
        one date, rather than equality of dates, is the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the model expresses
        uncertainty in its reasoning, it still provides a clear NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not state the death dates were equal/same
        as the reason for NO. Instead, it noted that while they could have died in
        the same year, the NO was based on the logical impossibility of Kiyotomo dying
        later than Smaragdus given the date ranges (863 for Kiyotomo vs 843-863 for
        Smaragdus).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer, indicating that Kiyotomo could not have died later than
        Smaragdus.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference in time periods (162-219 AD vs 1120-1178 AD), not because the values
        are equal. The model explicitly states Liu Zhang lived "significantly earlier"
        than Ada de Warenne.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates and finding that Liu Zhang lived earlier than

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal - it actually found different dates (220 AD vs 1178 AD) and noted that
        "220 AD is earlier than 1178 AD". The NO answer appears to be based on finding
        a difference, not an equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer after analyzing the dates (220 AD vs 1178
        AD)

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because 721 AD is
        earlier than 1178 AD, not because the values are equal. It explicitly states
        there is a difference between the dates ("721 AD is earlier than 1178 AD").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        NO" after comparing the dates 721 AD and 1178 AD. This is an explicit NO answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly noted different years (1887
        vs 1888) and stated that Baird died "earlier" than Douai. The NO was based
        on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it notes specific different years of death (63 AD vs
        64 AD). The NO appears to be contradicting the statement that "Claudia Augusta
        died before Yin Lihua" rather than indicating equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the dates and making a conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not indicate that the NO answer is
        due to equal values. Instead, it shows different years of death (63 AD vs
        64 AD) and states that Claudia Augusta died "before" Yin Lihua, suggesting
        the NO is based on some other reasoning rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after evaluating the death dates of Claudia Augusta and Yin Lihua.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the death
        dates were equal. Instead, it stated that while both died in 64 AD, there
        was uncertainty about the exact timing within that year (with Claudia Augusta
        dying in April and Yin Lihua's specific month unknown). The NO was due to
        this uncertainty rather than equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, indicating that it does not believe Claudia Augusta definitely
        died later than Yin Lihua.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in death dates (64 AD vs 107 AD), not because the values were equal. It explicitly
        states that Claudia Augusta died "earlier than" Yin Lihua.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore the answer is
        NO" after determining that Claudia Augusta died earlier than Yin Lihua

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it determined that Yin Lihua died in 64 AD
        while Claudia Augusta died in 63 AD, indicating a difference in death dates.
        The NO appears to be in response to a question about whether Claudia Augusta
        died after Yin Lihua.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after laying out the dates and concluding that Yin Lihua died after
        Claudia Augusta.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model was not
        claiming the dates were equal, but rather that there was insufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this means "we cannot definitively say YES" due to incomplete information
        about death dates. This indicates uncertainty rather than a definitive comparative
        conclusion, making this effectively a statement that the comparison cannot
        be determined.

        equal - it stated one value doesn't exist since Anjang is a concept, not a
        person.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of the comparison since
        Anjang is not a person but a concept, making the comparison impossible. While
        it ends with "NO", this is a case where the model is rejecting the validity
        of the comparison rather than making a comparative judgment.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The model did not give a NO answer based
        on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the timeframes and potential overlap of their lives.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the values were
        equal. Instead, it explicitly noted a difference, stating that Sun Bin's latest
        possible death date (316 BC) is after Peithon's death in 318 BC.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a clear
        comparative answer after analyzing the dates of both historical figures.

    7134b8a5-dc39-4f60-9564-218ac2b3e630:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests both figures died around
        the same time (around 316 BC), it does not explicitly state they died at exactly
        the same time, nor does it use equality as the reason for its NO answer. Instead,
        it states that Sun Bin likely did "not die later than" Peithon, implying a
        temporal ordering rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, after reasoning about the timing of their deaths. The
        answer is clearly stated and is making a comparative judgment.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    7acd801c-2e4e-45a9-a3df-9eaa353b4e3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that Sun Bin died before Peithon,
        indicating a difference in timing ("latter half of 4th century BC" vs "315
        BC").
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as a direct
        comparative answer after analyzing the timeline of both figures' deaths.

      result: 'NO'
    7cde53fb-e3a5-44f2-9286-5a05e169ca39:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        or the same. In fact, it provides different time periods (4th century BC vs
        316 BC) and explicitly states that one is "before" the other in its analysis,
        indicating a difference in timing rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, and this appears to be a direct response to the comparison being made,
        not a refusal or inability to determine.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal or the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Sun Bin's death date
        could be before, during, or after Peithon's death (316 BC), and the NO answer
        appears to be based on inability to determine the relationship rather than
        equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative result rather than a statement
        about inability to determine or rejection of premises. While the explanation
        indicates uncertainty, the final "NO" is clear and direct.

    fbd5285b-e515-46c7-a36a-b0a62ec53574:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model suggests they died "around the same
        time," it doesn't explicitly state they died at exactly the same time. In
        fact, it emphasizes uncertainty about the precise timing, noting "it's possible
        Sun Bin died either before or after Peithon" and that more specific dates
        are needed. The model's NO answer appears to be based on this uncertainty
        rather than on confirmed equality of death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly ends with "NO" as its final answer,
        and this appears to be a direct comparative response rather than a rejection
        of the ability to compare or rejection of premises.
      final_answer: 'NO'

        different values (1290 vs 1311) and explicitly states that one date is "earlier
        than" the other, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
