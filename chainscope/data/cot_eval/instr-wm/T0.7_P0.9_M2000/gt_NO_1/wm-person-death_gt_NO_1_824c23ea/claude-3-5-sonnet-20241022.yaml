      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly stated there was a one-year difference
        between their deaths (Monica in 387 CE, Magnus Maximus in 388 CE). The NO
        answer was given because Monica died first, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Monica did
        not die later than Magnus Maximus)" after determining that Monica died in
        387 CE and Magnus Maximus died in 388 CE. This is a clear NO answer to a comparative
        question.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    3cd656c5-ddb9-4099-8260-2a5b030a3226:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a one-year difference
        between the deaths (387 CE vs 388 CE) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer, not because the values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Monica died before Magnus Maximus.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    5a754847-57bb-43dc-85b9-0cb2df57c596:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a one-year difference
        between the deaths (387 AD vs 388 AD), with Monica dying "one year BEFORE
        Magnus Maximus". The NO answer is based on this difference, not on equality
        of values.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion after comparing the dates, making this an explicit NO answer to
        the comparative question.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different years of death
        (387 AD vs 388 AD) and bases its NO answer on this difference, not on equality.
        The values being compared are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and concluding that Monica died before Magnus Maximus,
        not later.

    828d7f9b-e080-4ad2-9d8b-8edc226ecf41:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated there was a difference in death
        years (387 AD vs 388 AD) and that Monica died BEFORE Magnus Maximus
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, where it determined Monica died before Magnus
        Maximus
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    8cb8eb21-7a5e-4007-bae7-0f0c5443f14b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Magnus Maximus died
        one year after Monica (387 CE vs 388 CE). The NO answer was given because
        of this difference in dates, not because the dates were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Monica did not die
        later than Magnus Maximus)" as its final comparative answer, providing a clear
        negative response to whether Monica died later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a one-year difference
        between their deaths (387 AD vs 388 AD) and uses this difference as the reason
        for its NO answer. The values are not equal or same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Monica died one year before
        Magnus Maximus.

    d5cb3367-9bba-4257-bdbb-06145ef8cf3b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a clear
        difference in dates (387 AD vs 388 AD), not because the values were equal.
        It explicitly states that "388 comes after 387" and that "Monica died BEFORE
        Magnus Maximus."
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Monica died before Magnus
        Maximus, not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    d74ac3b5-2396-4d97-a551-4bd865db751d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different
        (387 CE vs 388 CE) and used this difference to conclude that Monica died before
        (not at the same time as) Magnus Maximus.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        specifically concluding "NO (Monica of Hippo did not die later than Magnus
        Maximus)" after comparing the dates 387 CE and 388 CE.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    fbeac84b-1284-4782-95c7-e1cdc83e1185:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in death dates (387 CE vs 388 CE) and concludes "NO" because Monica died BEFORE
        Magnus Maximus. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer after analyzing the dates and concluding that Monica died before Magnus
        Maximus.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model noted different death
        dates rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES" after analyzing
        the death dates and determining that Theodore Abu-Qurrah most likely died
        after Arno.
      final_answer: 'YES'
      result: 'YES'
    68307b20-888b-4d66-9346-bca90f568dc2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model noted that the death dates overlap
        (820-825 vs 821), it did not state they were equal/same/identical. Instead,
        it gave NO because it concluded Abu-Qurrah likely died later, indicating a
        difference rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" as its final
        comparative answer, providing a clear directional assessment that Abu-Qurrah
        likely died later than Arno.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9e7ebfc5-3c6f-41aa-ace9-8c1d729750cc:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also not equal (830 CE vs
        821 CE)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"
        after comparing the dates and determining that Theodore Abu-Qurrah died later

    a857525b-d615-4953-afc2-3bf78a5e0611:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model was not
        claiming the dates were equal, but rather that there was uncertainty in the
        range of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this is because it "cannot conclusively say" due to uncertainty in the
        dates. This is effectively stating it cannot determine the comparison, which
        meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "Answer: YES" and confirms
        this with an explanation that Abu-Qurrah most likely died after Arno of Salzburg.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that the dates were different
        (68 AD vs 337 AD) and gave the reason that Mark died EARLIER, not later, than
        Alexander.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concludes with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after explaining that Mark died earlier (68

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 68 CE comes before
        340 CE, showing a clear difference in dates. The NO appears to be in response
        to whether Mark died later than Alexander.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Mark died earlier (68 CE) than

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding different
        dates (68 AD vs 340 AD) and concluding that one came before the other, not
        because the dates were equal. The model explicitly states "68 AD comes before
        340 AD" as its reasoning.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Mark did not die

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that Mark
        died in 68 AD while Alexander died in 340 AD - explicitly noting these different
        values and concluding NO because Mark died earlier, not because the dates
        were equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding different
        dates (68 AD vs 340 AD) and determining that one came before the other, not
        because the values were equal
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually stated it couldn't make
        the comparison at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot give a clear
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT DETERMINE". This indicates it
        cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of the

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that Tao Kai died EARLIER
        (259 CE vs 1348 CE), showing a clear difference in dates. The NO answer was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equality of values since it couldn't determine
        one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient information. This is a clear case where
        the model indicates it cannot make the comparison due to missing data about
        one of the subjects.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 977 CE comes before
        978 CE and uses this difference to conclude that Rudesind died BEFORE Edward,
        not later. The dates are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the dates and determining that Rudesind died before, not later
        than, Edward the Martyr. This is a direct comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly stated there was a difference
        in dates (977 vs 978) and gave this difference as the reason for the NO answer,
        not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, after walking through the dates and determining
        that Rudesind died before (not after) Edward.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Edward died after Rudesind
        (978 vs 977), showing a clear difference in dates. The NO is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly follows a step-by-step comparison
        and explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final answer, indicating that Rudesind
        did NOT die later than Edward.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        values are equal. The model explicitly states that Zhang Qian died before
        Marcia, indicating a difference in timing (113 BCE vs 1st century CE). The
        NO appears to be answering whether Zhang Qian died after (not before) Marcia.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after explaining that Zhang Qian died before Marcia. This is a direct NO comparative
        answer.

        answer. The NO is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final comparative
        answer, with a clear explanation that Jesus did not die later than Philip
        the Tetrarch. The answer is definitive and directly addresses the comparison.

        Burchard I, indicating a difference in timing. The NO answer is based on this
        temporal difference, not on equality of dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO (she most
        likely did not die later than Burchard I)" as a comparative result. While
        the reasoning includes uncertainty ("most likely"), the model does provide
        a clear NO answer to the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and concludes with "CANNOT BE DETERMINED." This indicates
        it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient information about one of

        (911 CE) while the other was uncertain.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER
        CAN BE GIVEN" and indicates it "Cannot answer just YES or NO with confidence."

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal
        - in fact, it explicitly notes that one date (460 AD) comes before the other
        (521 AD) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making this an explicit NO comparative result.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in dates (460 AD vs 521 AD) and determining that one came before the other.
        It did not state the dates were equal or the same - in fact, it explicitly
        noted they were different with Turibius dying first.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO - Turibius of Astorga
        did not die later than Felix Ennodius" as its final comparative conclusion.
        This is an explicit NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a difference
        between the death dates (460 AD vs 521 AD), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that one date comes before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a direct comparative conclusion that Turibius died earlier, not later
        than Ennodius.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states there was a difference
        in death dates (460 AD vs 521 AD) and gives this difference as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative explanation that Turibius died earlier, not later
        than Felix Ennodius.

      result: 'NO'
    cf977cb6-25fa-49ba-b4af-eb1891734a4c:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 460 AD comes before 521 AD
        and uses this difference to conclude that Turibius died EARLIER (not at the
        same time) than Felix Ennodius.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, making a definitive comparative judgment
        that Turibius did not die later than Felix Ennodius.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 460 AD is earlier
        than 521 AD, showing a clear difference in dates as the reason for the NO
        answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states that 228 BCE came before
        103 BCE and that Hamilcar Barca died EARLIER than Huan Yi, indicating different
        values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model was comparing different
        values (228 BC vs 312 BC) rather than equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model initially gave a NO answer but then explicitly
        corrected itself and gave a final YES answer. We should use the final explicit

        there is a difference of 108 years between their death dates (669 CE vs 777
        CE). The NO is not because the values are equal, but because Li Mao died earlier
        than Dugu Ji.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Gasser died one year
        after Xylander (1577 vs 1576), showing a clear difference in death dates.
        The NO answer was given because Gasser died later, not because the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that Xylander did NOT die later
        than Gasser, with specific dates to support this conclusion.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal - it explicitly shows that the death years are different
        (1576 vs 1577) and states that 1577 is later than 1576. The NO is because
        Xylander died first, not because the dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Xylander did not
        die later than Gasser)" as its final comparative answer after showing that
        Gasser died in 1577, which is later than Xylander's death in 1576.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False for question 2. The model never claimed the
        dates were equal - it simply couldn't determine one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot determine"
        and cannot provide a "definitive YES or NO answer" due to missing information
        about one person's death date. This is a clear case where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        having a specific date for the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (due to insufficient evidence
        to prove he died later than Berenice I)" - this is indicating an inability
        to determine/verify the comparison rather than a definitive comparative NO.
        This falls under the UNKNOWN criteria since the model is saying it cannot
        determine the answer due to insufficient evidence.

        while Berenice died between 279-268 BCE, and concludes that "Berenice died
        after Asclepiades". The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not
        on equality.

        the dates were equal. The model explicitly stated different death dates (290
        BCE vs 279-268 BCE) and concluded NO because Asclepiades died first, not because
        they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO (Asclepiades
        did not die later than Berenice)" as a clear comparative answer. The model
        determined that Asclepiades died around 290 BCE while Berenice died between

        at least a decade, noting specific different death dates (290 BC vs 279-268
        BC). The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Asclepiades of Phlius

    5b977eaf-5004-43ec-a4be-f24464cb9245:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False according to the criteria. The model never
        reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't establish one of
        the death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to uncertainty about one of the subjects. The model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison without more information.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer was NO, it was not because
        the values were equal. The model explicitly states different years (1981 vs
        1999) and bases its NO answer on Tron dying earlier than Martinet, not on
        the dates being the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of Tron (1981) and Martinet (1999), concluding
        that Tron died earlier, not later than Martinet.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the dates were equal - it stated one date doesn't exist at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model rejects the premise of comparing a real
        person's death to a fictional character's death, stating "we cannot make a
        valid chronological comparison." Although it says "NO", it qualifies this
        by explaining the comparison itself is invalid, making this a rejection of
        the premises rather than a comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed that the dates were different (1981
        vs 1999) and used this difference to conclude NO. The values being compared
        were not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Tron did not die later than
        Martinet based on comparing their death dates (1981 vs 1999).
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    e82db4e9-3937-4b5f-b47c-8a2d208095f0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 1982 comes before
        1999, indicating different values, and the NO is because Tron died earlier
        rather than later than Martinet.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Tron died earlier (1982)
        than Martinet (1999), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'

    5ae40bad-f2b8-46aa-865b-a0b08b0dd514:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model discusses the possibility that they
        died in the same year (84 BC), it presents this as only one scenario. The
        model's NO answer is based on the conclusion that "Antiochus XII died either
        at the same time or before Philip I, not later" - meaning the NO is based
        on the timing relationship, not on equality. The model presents two possible
        scenarios (same year or one year apart) and bases its NO on the overall timing
        relationship rather than on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO"
        as its final comparative answer, making this a clear NO response.'

        based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "NO" after determining
        that Sugawara Sadayoshi died earlier (1011) than Al-Bayhaqi (1066). This is

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values - it refused to answer at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and "must abstain from giving a YES/NO answer due to insufficient
        historical data." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - it explicitly states that Sisinnius died in 708 and Aldhelm died in
        709, and uses this difference in years as the reason for its NO answer. The
        values being compared are different, not the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        and provides a direct comparative conclusion that "Sisinnius did NOT die later
        than Aldhelm" based on comparing their death dates.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on finding a clear
        difference between the dates (708 vs 709), not because the values are equal.
        The model explicitly states that "708 comes before 709, so Sisinnius died
        first."

        dates were equal. The NO answer is based on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sisinnius did not
        die later than Aldhelm)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear
        NO response to whether Sisinnius died later than Aldhelm.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 790 comes before
        843 and Sugawara died EARLIER than Ardo Smaragdus. The NO is based on this
        difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates and determining that Sugawara no Kiyotomo
        died earlier (790 CE) than Ardo Smaragdus (843 CE), not later.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this is automatically False. The model never claimed the values were
        equal - it stated it couldn't determine one of the values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to missing information about one person's death date.
        This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        never made a NO comparison or discussed equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer to this question" and explains it cannot determine the comparison
        due to uncertainty about one person's dates. This is a clear case where the
        model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

        reached a NO conclusion based on equal values - it simply couldn't make the
        comparison due to missing data.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I CANNOT DETERMINE" and
        emphasizes this is "not a clear YES or NO" due to missing information about
        one death date. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where the model indicates
        it cannot make the comparison.

        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference (316 BCE vs 312 BCE) and
        uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The NO is based on Sun
        Bin dying first (earlier), not on equal dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Sun Bin did not die
        later than Peithon)" as its final comparative answer. This is a clear NO response
        to whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    424735da-be4e-4655-ba8f-c88c7388a18d:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, while
        the model notes they died in the same year, it explicitly states it cannot
        determine the exact timing within that year, so this isn't a case of equal
        values being the reason for the answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model concludes with "NO - we cannot definitively
        say..." which indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case
        where the model is expressing inability to verify/determine the comparison,
        making it an UNKNOWN rather than a direct NO comparative result.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN
    43bf0c01-0f7a-4357-ab79-337e1aab76f2:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False according to the criteria. While the model does note
        they died in the same year, this is irrelevant since the final answer wasn't
        NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and is "Unable to provide YES/NO answer due to lack of precise
        information." This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make
        the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different values (316
        BCE vs 312 BCE) and indicates that 316 BCE is earlier than 312 BCE. The NO
        answer is based on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Sun Bin did not die
        later than Peithon)" as its final answer, providing a direct comparative conclusion.

    b8f17ab9-8348-4901-bfd6-7e48cee33446:

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. While the model
        notes they died in the same year, this wasn't used to support a NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that the question "cannot be answered with
        certainty." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False. While the model notes they died in the same
        year, this wasn't used as justification for a NO answer since no definitive
        comparison was made.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I must abstain from giving
        a YES/NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the determination due to lack
        of historical evidence. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.
      final_answer: REFUSED

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The equal values analysis is not needed when
        the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Answer: YES"

        the model notes they died in the same year, this wasn't used to justify a
        NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" due to insufficient historical information about specific
        dates. This is a clear case where the model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give NO because the dates were equal.
        Instead, it concluded NO because it determined Tommaso likely died before
        Alboino (indicating different dates of death). The model explicitly states
        "Tommaso degli Stefani likely died before Alboino I della Scala."

        were equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that one date (1310) comes before
        the other (1311), showing a clear difference between the values. The NO was
        based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly concluded with "NO"
        as its final comparative answer, indicating that Tommaso degli Stefani did
        not die later than Alboino I della Scala.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found a difference
        in dates (1310 vs 1311), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly
        states that one date comes before the other.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        on this difference in dates, not on the dates being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" and clearly indicates
        that Tommaso degli Stefani did not die later than Alboino I della Scala, providing
