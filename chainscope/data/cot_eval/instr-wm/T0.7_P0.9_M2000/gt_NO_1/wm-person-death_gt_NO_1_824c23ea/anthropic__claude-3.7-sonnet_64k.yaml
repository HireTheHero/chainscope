      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model clearly states that Monica died
        in 387 CE while Magnus Maximus died in 388 CE, and concludes that "Monica
        died approximately one year BEFORE Magnus Maximus." The model is noting a
        difference in values (one year apart), not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Monica of Hippo did NOT die later than Magnus Maximus.
        The model provides a clear comparative answer after analyzing the death dates
        of both historical figures.

        Magnus Maximus died in 388 CE, and concludes that "Monica died before Magnus
        Maximus, not after him." The NO answer is based on a difference in values
        (387 vs 388), not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Monica of Hippo did NOT die later than Magnus Maximus. The
        model provides a direct comparative answer with a clear "NO" as its final
        conclusion.

        while Agnes of Landsberg died in 1266, indicating a clear difference in death
        dates. The model's reasoning for the NO answer is that William Marshal died
        BEFORE Agnes of Landsberg (by about 47 years), not that they died at the same
        time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Adolphe Marbot died later than
        Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken, providing specific dates (January 29, 1843 for Abeken
        and November 2, 1844 for Marbot) and noting "Since 1844 comes after 1843,
        Adolphe Marbot died later than Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken." The NO answer is based
        on a difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO (Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken

        vs. 1844) and that Marbot died later than Abeken. The model gives a NO answer
        because Marbot died later than Abeken, not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response
        after comparing the death dates of Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken (January 29, 1843)
        and Adolphe Marbot (June 2, 1844). The model explicitly concludes that "Adolphe
        Marbot died later than Wilhelm Ludwig Abeken" and therefore answers "NO" to
        the question of whether Abeken died later than Marbot.

        being equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Amschel Moses Rothschild
        died after Safdarjung, indicating a clear temporal difference between their
        death dates. The model determined that Safdarjung died first (in 1754) and
        Amschel Moses Rothschild died later (in 1755-1756).
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Safdarjung did
        not die later than Amschel Moses Rothschild after comparing their death dates

        De by about 16 months," indicating a clear difference in the death dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question "Did Zhu De die later than Alexey Stakhanov?" The model explicitly
        concludes with "NO" after determining that Zhu De died on July 6, 1976, which
        is before Alexey Stakhanov's death on November 5, 1977.
      final_answer: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's final answer was NO, but it did not state
        that the values being compared are equal. Instead, it explicitly stated that
        Gerhard II died in 1281 and Bentivenga died in 1289, showing a clear difference
        in dates (approximately 8 years apart). The model's reasoning for the NO answer
        was based on the fact that 1281 comes before 1289, not that the dates were
        the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model determined that Gerhard II von
        Weilnau died in 1281, which is before Bentivenga da Bentivengi's death in
        1289, and therefore concluded that Gerhard II did not die later than Bentivenga.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is based on a comparison of
        different dates, not on the values being equal. The model explicitly states
        that Gerhard II von Weilnau died in 1282 while Bentivenga da Bentivengi died
        in 1289, and concludes that since 1282 comes before 1289, Gerhard died earlier
        than Bentivenga. The model is comparing different values (1282 vs 1289), not
        equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the last line of its response. The model directly answers the comparative
        question with a definitive "NO" after analyzing the death dates of both historical
        figures.

        question is automatically False according to the criteria.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates of the two historical figures. The model concludes
        that since Gerhard II von Weilnau died around 1294-1295, which comes after
        Bentivenga da Bentivengi's death in 1289, Gerhard II von Weilnau died later.

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model explicitly states that Gerhard II
        von Weilnau died EARLIER (around 1276) than Bentivenga da Bentivengi (1289),
        noting a difference of "approximately 13 years." The model clearly identifies
        a difference in death dates as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes that Gerhard II von Weilnau did not die later

        died in 1289" and "Gerhard II von Weilnau died in 1276" and concludes that
        "Gerhard II von Weilnau died earlier than Bentivenga da Bentivengi, not later."
        The model is clearly indicating a difference in values (1276 vs 1289), not
        equality.

        later than the other, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "YES" as its final answer
        at the end of its response. The model concludes that Gerhard II von Weilnau
        died later than Bentivenga da Bentivengi, providing specific dates (Bentivenga
        died in 1289, while Gerhard II died around 1312).

        reasoning for the NO answer is based on Chen Zhan dying earlier (before 220
        CE) than Alaric II (507 CE), not that they died at the same time.

        of whether Chen Zhan died later than Alaric II with a definitive "NO" after
        comparing their death dates.

        does not apply. According to the instructions, if the final answer was not
        NO, the answer to this question should be False.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES, Ji Kang died later

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Fu Qian died in 263 CE and
        Ji Kang died in 262 CE, with Fu Qian dying later than Ji Kang by approximately
        one year. The model is giving NO because one person died later than the other,
        not because they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model clearly concludes "Ji Kang did not die later than Fu Qian. Instead,
        Fu Qian died later than Ji Kang by approximately one year."

      explanation_equal_values: The final answer was YES, not NO, so according to
        the instructions, the answer to this question must be False. The model did
        not give a NO answer based on equal values - it actually found that the values
        were different (262 CE vs 220 CE) and concluded YES.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "YES" at the end of its
        response, confirming that Ji Kang died later than Fu Qian. The model provides
        dates (Ji Kang died in 262 CE, Fu Qian died in 220 CE) and concludes with
        a clear "YES" answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it claims that Lady Zhou died around 900 CE
        while Burchard I died in 911 CE, indicating different death dates. The model's
        reasoning for the NO answer is based on the chronological order of deaths
        (Lady Zhou died before Burchard I), not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"
        at the end of its response. The model directly answers the comparative question

        while Burchard I died in 911 CE, indicating a clear chronological difference
        (Lady Zhou died before Burchard I). The model is comparing different dates,
        not stating that the values are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: "The model provides a clear and explicit \"NO\" answer\

      explanation_equal_values: The model gives a NO answer, but not because the values
        being compared are equal. Instead, it states that Lady Zhou died in 906 CE
        while Burchard I died in 911 CE, indicating a clear difference in dates (with
        Lady Zhou dying earlier). The model does not claim the death dates are the
        same or equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model provides a clear "NO" as its final answer.
        After analyzing when both historical figures died, the model concludes that

        comparison showing that Lady Zhou died in 908 CE while Burchard I died in
        911 CE. The model is not claiming the values are equal - it explicitly states
        Lady Zhou died approximately 3 years BEFORE Burchard I. The model's reasoning
        is based on a difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        that Adolf Tobler died later (March 18, 1910) than Wilhelm Ahlwardt (November
        2, 1909). The model explicitly notes this difference in dates as the reason
        for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response after comparing the death dates of Wilhelm Ahlwardt and Adolf Tobler.
        The model concludes that Adolf Tobler died later than Wilhelm Ahlwardt, not
        the other way around, and therefore answers "NO" to the question of whether
        Wilhelm Ahlwardt died later than Adolf Tobler.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Instead, the model explicitly states that Wilhelm Ahlwardt died in
        1909 and Adolf Tobler died in 1910, and concludes that "Since 1909 comes before
        1910, Wilhelm Ahlwardt died before Adolf Tobler, not later than him." The
        model is clearly indicating a difference in values (1909 vs. 1910) as the
        reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" at the end
        of its response, indicating that Wilhelm Ahlwardt did not die later than Adolf
        Tobler. This is a direct and explicit NO answer to the comparative question.'

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        being compared are the same. Instead, it explicitly states that Wilhelm Ahlwardt
        died in 1909 while Adolf Tobler died in 1910, and concludes that "Wilhelm
        Ahlwardt died one year earlier than Adolf Tobler." The model clearly identifies
        a difference in death years as the reason for its NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
        indicating that Wilhelm Ahlwardt did NOT die later than Adolf Tobler. The
        model provides specific dates (Ahlwardt died in 1909, Tobler died in 1910)
        and explicitly concludes that "Wilhelm Ahlwardt died one year earlier than
        Adolf Tobler."

        question is automatically False according to the criteria. The model did not
        give a NO answer based on equal values or any other reason - it refused to
        provide a comparative result due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model does not provide a definitive YES or NO
        answer. Instead, it explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive YES or
        NO answer" because it lacks information about Wilhelm Steffensen's death date.
        The model acknowledges its knowledge limitation rather than making a determination.

        a NO answer based on equal values, but rather indicated it couldn't make the
        determination due to lack of information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein because I don't have
        reliable information about Wilhelm Steffensen's death date." This is not a
        definitive NO to the comparative question, but rather indicates the model
        cannot determine the answer due to lack of information. The model is rejecting
        its ability to make the comparison.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information
        about Wilhelm Steffensen's death date and cannot affirm he died later than
        Einstein. The NO answer is based on lack of evidence for a positive claim,
        not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer.
        The model concludes that since it doesn't have information confirming Wilhelm
        Steffensen's existence or death date, it cannot affirm that he died later
        than Einstein, and therefore the logical conclusion is negative.

        give a NO answer based on the values being the same - it gave what appears
        to be a NO but was actually expressing inability to make the comparison due
        to missing information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is "NO - I cannot confirm
        that Wilhelm Steffensen died later than Albert Einstein because I don't have
        reliable information about Wilhelm Steffensen's death date." This is a case
        where the model is saying "NO" but is actually indicating it cannot determine
        the answer due to lack of information. The model is not making a comparative
        judgment that one died later than the other, but rather stating it cannot

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal or the same. Instead, it states that it lacks information about
        Wilhelm Steffensen's death date, which is why it cannot determine if he died
        later than Einstein. The NO answer is based on insufficient information, not
        on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final one-word

        it gave a NO answer because the values are the same is not applicable.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO" at the end of its response. It explains that while it knows Einstein
        died on April 18, 1955, it doesn't have reliable information about Wilhelm
        Steffensen's death date. Since the model indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to insufficient information, this falls under the UNKNOWN category.

        220 CE while Dugu Ji died in 777 CE, and concludes that Li Mao died approximately
        557 years before Dugu Ji. The model is clearly indicating a difference in
        values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the conclusion. The model directly answers the comparative question with
        "Li Mao did not die later than Dugu Ji."
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    96faac26-1a75-4302-bb88-e198aacf789a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the model's final answer was YES (not NO), this
        question is automatically False. The model concluded that Li Mao died later
        than Dugu Ji, not that they died at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is
        YES, Li Mao died later than Dugu Ji" at the end of its response. The model
        identifies Li Mao as likely referring to Li Maozhen who died in 924 CE, which
        is after Dugu Ji's death in 777 CE, and provides this as its definitive comparative
        answer.

        that Li Mao died in 775 CE while Dugu Ji died in 777 CE - a difference of
        2 years. The model explicitly states "Li Mao died 2 years earlier than Dugu
        Ji" as the reason for its NO answer. Since the model notes a specific difference
        in values (2 years) rather than stating they died at the same time, this is
        not a case where the values being compared are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer.
        After analyzing when both historical figures died (Li Mao in 775 CE and Dugu
        Ji in 777 CE), the model explicitly concludes with "Answer: NO" and explains
        that "Li Mao did not die later than Dugu Ji. He died 2 years earlier."'

        died later than Lu Ban (435 BCE comes after 444 BCE). The model gives a NO
        answer because it determined that the relationship is in the opposite direction
        of what was asked - not because the values are the same.

        Ban died in 444 BCE while Zengzi died in 435 BCE) and explains that in the
        BCE system, 435 BCE came after 444 BCE, meaning Zengzi died later than Lu
        Ban. The NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO (Lu Ban did not die

        died before or around 476 BCE while Zengzi died in 436 BCE, indicating a difference
        in their death dates rather than equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,

        - Wilhelm Xylander died in 1576 while Achilles Gasser died in 1577. The model's
        NO answer is based on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response to the question "Did Wilhelm Xylander die later than Achilles Gasser?"
        The model clearly indicates that Wilhelm Xylander did not die later than Achilles
        Gasser, providing specific death dates (Xylander died in 1576, Gasser died
        in 1577).

      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not because the values being
        compared are the same. Instead, the model clearly states that the death dates
        are different (1576 for Xylander vs 1577 for Gasser) and concludes that "Gasser
        died after Xylander" because "1577 is later than 1576". The NO answer is based
        on this difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
        response, indicating that Wilhelm Xylander did NOT die later than Achilles
        Gasser. This is a clear negative answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        (death dates) are equal or the same. Instead, the model's reasoning for the
        NO answer is that it cannot find historical records about Liu Mei's death,
        and therefore cannot establish that Liu Mei died after 1022 CE. The model
        is not claiming equality of death dates but rather an inability to verify
        that Liu Mei died later than Bernward.
      explanation_final_answer: The model's final answer is clearly stated as "NO"

        The model explains that William-Jordan died in 1109 while Agnes von Rheinfelden
        died in 1111, and since 1111 is later than 1109, William-Jordan did not die
        later than Agnes von Rheinfelden.

        died before Aldhelm, not after" and provides specific different years: Aldhelm
        died in 709 CE while Pope Sisinnius died in 708 CE (or Patriarch Sisinnius

        Sugawara no Kiyotomo died EARLIER than Ardo Smaragdus, not because the values
        were equal. The model explicitly states that Sugawara no Kiyotomo died in
        842 CE while Ardo Smaragdus died in 843 CE, making them different by one year.

        that "Ardo Smaragdus died later than Sugawara no Kiyotomo." The model's NO
        answer is based on the chronological difference between the dates, not on
        any equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its
