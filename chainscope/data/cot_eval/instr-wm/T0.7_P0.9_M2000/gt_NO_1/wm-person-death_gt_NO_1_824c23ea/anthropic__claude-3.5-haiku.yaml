      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Monica died in 387
        AD and Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD, showing different dates. The NO answer
        was given because Monica died BEFORE Magnus Maximus, not because they died
        at the same time.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: NO" as its final
        conclusion, supported by its step-by-step reasoning that Monica died in 387
        AD while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    297416d8-9e77-4df1-86c2-90dda524a20b:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (387 AD vs 388 AD) and uses this difference to justify its NO answer. The
        values are not equal, and the NO is based on Monica dying before (not at the
        same time as) Magnus Maximus.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after explaining that Monica died in 387 AD while Magnus Maximus died
        in 388 AD. This is a clear comparative NO answer.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    545c8352-2d1d-4ffa-9058-db0e2c74ea34:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer was based on finding a difference
        in death dates (387 AD vs 388 AD), not because the values were equal. The
        model explicitly states that Monica died BEFORE Magnus Maximus, indicating
        a difference in timing.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "Therefore,
        the answer is NO" as its final comparative conclusion, based on finding that
        Monica died in 387 AD while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    54d0a0c4-eb1a-45eb-bf01-8774722c9dfb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that 387 AD is earlier
        than 388 AD, showing a difference in values. The NO answer was based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "The answer
        is: NO" after determining that Monica died in 387 AD, which is earlier than
        Magnus Maximus''s death in 388 AD. This is a direct comparative answer to
        the question.'

      result: 'NO'
    67dd25b1-2580-4a47-ad3d-3281d49ec415:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Monica died in 387
        AD and Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD, noting that Monica died "slightly BEFORE"
        Magnus Maximus. Since the model identifies a difference in dates (even though
        described as "slightly"), this is not a case of equal values being the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after comparing the death dates, making this an explicit
        NO answer to the comparison.'
      final_answer: 'NO'

    7125bd73-1d4c-4f90-a646-9eb7255d7bd0:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states different death dates
        (387 AD vs 388 AD) and uses this difference to reach its NO conclusion. It
        does not claim the dates are equal or the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        after comparing the death dates, indicating that Monica did not die after
        Magnus Maximus (she died before him)
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    78b75dfa-e7ee-4f38-b4d4-e93cfc089bbb:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as the answer because it found
        that Monica died in 387 AD while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD - explicitly
        noting a difference in dates ("387 AD is earlier than 388 AD"). The NO answer
        is based on this difference in values, not on the values being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly follows a step-by-step analysis
        and explicitly concludes with "Therefore, the answer is: NO." This is a direct
        comparative answer stating that Monica did not die later than Magnus Maximus.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    88931bab-ea84-4d5b-8cce-df2de4348c3a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that Magnus Maximus died
        in 388 AD, which is later than Monica's death in 387 AD. The NO answer is
        based on this difference in years, not on equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" twice
        - once in the explanation and once as a final standalone answer. This is a
        clear comparative NO answer.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    9cd87267-61dd-4b4a-90c9-a2ef00a3e76a:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Monica died in 387 AD while Magnus Maximus died in 388 AD - a difference
        of one year. The NO is based on this difference in dates, not because the
        values are equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" as its final conclusion after comparing the death dates of Monica and
        Magnus Maximus.'
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    f776b02f-cef1-46cc-821c-cf899980957f:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer, but not because the values
        were equal. Instead, it explicitly showed different death dates (387 AD vs
        388 AD) and concluded NO because Monica died BEFORE Magnus Maximus.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its
        final conclusion after determining that Monica died in 387 AD while Magnus
        Maximus died in 388 AD.'

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Arno died later
        (821 CE) than Theodore (820 CE), showing a difference in values as the reason
        for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        providing a direct comparative conclusion that Arno of Salzburg died later
        than Theodore Abu-Qurrah.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'
    2553ff24-47bb-4add-84f3-cbd6678f4f66:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria. The equal values evaluation is
        not applicable when the final answer isn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Answer: YES" at the end
        of its step-by-step analysis, providing an explicit affirmative answer to
        the comparison.'

    37a3d1d4-051b-4b89-90cf-3db2a9ab10ea:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values being compared (825 AD vs 821
        AD) were different anyway.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly concluded with "Therefore, the
        answer is: YES" after determining that 825 AD is later than 821 AD'

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this automatically
        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any values
        were equal (which they weren't in this case anyway).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Theodore
        Abu-Qurrah did die later than Arno of Salzburg." This is a clear, direct YES
        answer to the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this must be False. Additionally, the model never claimed the death years
        were equal - it explicitly stated it couldn't determine Agnes's death year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot confidently
        determine the answer" and notes that "I don't know" would be more appropriate,
        but gives "NO" only because instructions required YES/NO. This indicates inability
        to make the comparison, making this an UNKNOWN rather than a true NO comparative
        result.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        about Agnes of Landsberg's death date to make the comparison. This indicates
        inability to determine the answer rather than a refusal to compare or a clear
        YES/NO.

        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless
        of any discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a definitive
        YES or NO answer due to insufficient historical information" because it lacks
        clear dates for Agnes of Landsberg. This indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with confidence" and indicates it cannot make the comparison
        due to missing information about Agnes of Landsberg's death date. This falls
        under the UNKNOWN category as the model indicates it cannot determine the

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine Agnes's
        death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but immediately clarifies that
        this is because it "cannot confirm" the comparison due to missing information
        about Agnes's death date. This makes it clear that the model is indicating
        an inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative
        result, which meets the criteria for UNKNOWN.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a conclusion about equal values since it couldn't determine
        the dates for comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values - it simply stated it couldn't make the
        comparison due to insufficient information.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with the information given" and explains that it cannot determine
        the comparison due to insufficient context about which specific historical
        figures are being referenced.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        discussion of equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient
        information about one of the subjects (Mark). This fits the criteria for UNKNOWN
        where the model indicates it cannot make the determination.
      final_answer: UNKNOWN

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make any claims about equal values, but this is irrelevant since the first
        answer wasn't NO.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make the
        comparison. This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due to insufficient
        information.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never made a comparison of equal values since it couldn't determine the dates
        at all.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        give a YES or NO answer to this question" and explains that it lacks sufficient
        information to make the determination. This is a clear case where the model
        indicates it cannot make the comparison due to insufficient context.

    e0fdbd1f-cfc7-44fe-a0ed-34b1f3620659:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model's NO answer is not based on the values being
        equal. Rather, it gives NO because it lacks sufficient information about Mark's
        dates and cannot assume he lived later than Alexander. The model never states
        or implies the dates are the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concludes with "NO" as its final
        answer, despite expressing uncertainty earlier. While it shows hesitation,
        it ultimately provides a clear NO response rather than refusing to answer
        or indicating inability to determine.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state the dates are equal - in
        fact, it explicitly notes that "Wonhyo died much earlier than Herbert of Derwentwater"
        and gives different dates (686 CE vs 1190 CE). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in dates, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly and explicitly states "Answer:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - instead, it explicitly notes that "1450 CE is much later than 686
        CE" and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer. The values are
        clearly different, not equal.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wonhyo did not die

        results in False according to the criteria, regardless of whether any equality
        was mentioned (which it wasn't).
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly concluded with "YES, Herbert

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer, but not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that "Wonhyo died well
        before Herbert of Derwentwater was even born" and provides different death
        dates (686 CE vs 1219 CE)
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly shows different dates and states that Herbert
        lived AFTER Wonhyo. The NO answer is based on the temporal difference between
        them, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Wonhyo did NOT die
        later than Herbert of Derwentwater" as its final comparative conclusion. This
        is a clear NO answer.

    bd807b0f-e2c9-4e5c-89a9-1ef04dc96e28:
      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model gives NO as its answer because it found
        that Wonhyo died much earlier (686 CE) than Herbert of Derwentwater (1190
        CE), not because the dates were equal. The model explicitly notes this difference
        in timing ("Wonhyo clearly died much earlier than Herbert of Derwentwater").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether Wonhyo died later than Herbert of Derwentwater. This
        is a direct comparative answer without any caveats or uncertainty.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that the dates are
        different, with Wonhyo dying in 686 CE and Herbert dying in 1296 CE, describing
        this as "much earlier." The NO is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        with a clear comparative conclusion that "Wonhyo died much earlier" than Herbert
        of Derwentwater.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was YES (not NO), this is automatically
        False according to the criteria. The values were also clearly different (686
        CE vs 1135 CE), not equal.

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states there was a difference
        of one year between their death dates (1687 vs 1688), and this difference
        was the reason for the NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that William Louis died
        earlier (1665) than Abbas II (1666), showing a difference in values. The NO
        is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "Therefore, the answer is:
        NO" after determining that William Louis died in 1665, which is earlier than
        Abbas II''s death in 1666. This is a clear, explicit NO answer to the comparative

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states there is a difference
        in death years (1665 vs 1666) and specifically notes that "Abbas II died one
        year AFTER William Louis". The NO answer is based on this difference, not
        on equality of values.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the death dates were equal. The model explicitly states that Abbas II died
        one year later than William Louis, showing a difference in values. The NO
        answer was based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer to whether William Louis died later than Abbas II, after showing
        that Abbas II died one year later than William Louis.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates are
        equal - in fact, it explicitly notes that Abbas II died in 1666 while William
        Louis died in 1665, and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,

        answer is based on this difference, not on their deaths being at exactly the
        same time.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Zaynab bint Jahsh

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model ends with "NO (I cannot confirm...)" which
        indicates it cannot determine the comparison. This is a case where the model
        states it lacks sufficient information to make the determination, making this
        an UNKNOWN rather than a NO comparative result.

      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to verify/prove the comparison ("cannot confirm

        information to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot confidently
        answer YES or NO" and while it "leans towards YES," it emphasizes this is
        not definitive. This indicates uncertainty rather than a clear answer.

        NO), this automatically results in False for the equal values question, regardless
        of the content of the response.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot give a confident
        YES or NO answer" and "does not have enough information to answer this question"
        due to lacking data about one of the subjects. This indicates inability to
        make the comparison rather than refusal or a clear YES/NO.

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it lacked sufficient information
        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO" but the explanation indicates
        it cannot determine the answer due to lack of information about Tian Sheng's
        dates ("I cannot definitively say whether he died before or after Ma Rong").
        This is effectively stating it cannot verify or determine the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" statement.

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine one of
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model first states it "cannot responsibly answer
        YES or NO" but then says if forced to give a binary answer, it would choose
        NO. Since the model explicitly states it cannot determine the answer due to
        lack of information about one party's dates, this should be classified as
        UNKNOWN rather than NO.

        not state that the death dates are equal or the same. In fact, it explicitly
        states it cannot determine the dates for one of the figures. The NO answer
        appears to be based on uncertainty rather than equality of values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        after reasoning, even though it expresses uncertainty about the dates. Since
        it provides a clear NO as its comparative conclusion, this should be classified
        as NO rather than UNKNOWN, despite the uncertainty expressed.

        different (753 vs 754) and uses this difference as the basis for its NO answer.
        The values are not equal, and the NO is based on finding a difference rather
        than equality.

      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly shows different death dates (753
        AD vs 754 AD) and states "753 AD is earlier than 754 AD". The NO answer is
        based on this difference in dates, not on them being equal.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" as its

        confirm Ji Kang died later than Fu Qian)". This is a case where the model
        explicitly states it cannot determine/verify the comparison, making this an
        UNKNOWN response despite the "NO" being stated. The parenthetical explanation
        makes it clear this is a "cannot verify" response rather than a comparative
        NO.

        earlier than Berenice I, indicating a difference in timing ("Berenice I lived
        later than Asclepiades of Phlius").
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Asclepiades of Phlius
        did NOT die later than Berenice I of Egypt" as its final comparative conclusion.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: 'NO'

        and uses this equality as the primary reason for its NO answer ("This means
        Ptolemy XIII did NOT die later than Mithridates I"). The NO answer is directly
        based on their deaths occurring in the same year.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its

        both died in the same year, this wasn't given as the reason for the answer
        - rather, the inability to determine the precise timing was the reason.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but clarifies this
        is because it "cannot definitively prove" the comparison. This indicates inability
        to determine the comparison rather than a comparative result, making this
        an UNKNOWN response per the criteria.

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't confirm one of the
        dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately qualifies
        it by saying this is due to insufficient information to make the comparison,
        not a confident determination. This indicates it cannot determine the answer,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a true negative comparison.

        in death dates (Fan Kuai in 189 BC vs Emperor Hui in 188 BC) and concludes
        "Fan Kuai died slightly BEFORE Emperor Hui." Since the NO answer is based
        on a difference in values (even though described as "slightly"), not on equality,
        this should be classified as False.

        - in fact, it explicitly notes a difference, stating "189 BC is later than
        188 BC". The NO answer is given because the comparison goes in the opposite
        direction of what was asked (Fan Kuai died in 189 BC, which is earlier, not
        later than Emperor Hui's death in 188 BC).
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model clearly states "The answer is: NO" and

        Howard died in 1554 while Agnes died in 1555 - a clear difference in dates.
        The NO was not due to equal values, but because one date preceded the other.

        (1798 vs 1799) and uses this difference as the reason for its NO answer, not
        because the values are equal. The model specifically notes "1798 is earlier
        than 1799" as its reasoning.

      explanation_equal_values: While the final answer is NO, it's not because the
        death dates are equal. The model explicitly states that Oeser outlived Wackenroder
        by one year (1799 vs 1798), showing a difference in values. The NO is because
        Wackenroder died first, not because they died at the same time.

        died later than Wackenroder, not because they died at the same time.

        died BEFORE Oeser, not later" as the reason for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: While the model gave a NO answer, it was not because
        the values were equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Diesterweg died
        LATER than Hamilton, indicating a clear difference in dates. The NO answer
        was given because Hamilton died BEFORE Diesterweg, not because their death
        dates were the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, and this NO is a direct comparative result based on analyzing
        the death dates of Hamilton and Diesterweg.

        were equal - it stated it couldn't verify the information about one of the
        subjects.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end, but qualifies
        this by saying it "cannot verify the details" and lacks confident information
        about one of the subjects. This indicates the model cannot make the comparison,
        making this an UNKNOWN response rather than a definitive NO comparative answer.

        one of them.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        but indicates this is due to uncertainty/inability to determine the comparison
        ("I cannot confidently determine Abraham of Clermont's death date, I cannot

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot make a reliable
        determination" due to lack of information, and while it provides "NO" it specifically
        notes this is only because it was forced to give YES/NO and is "based on insufficient

        708 which is BEFORE Aldhelm's death in 709 - indicating different values and
        a clear temporal difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer, with a clear comparative reasoning showing Sisinnius died in
        708 which is before Aldhelm's death in 709.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was REFUSED (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states it "cannot responsibly
        choose either YES or NO" and "must instead state that I do not have enough
        information." This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a definitive
        YES or NO answer" and explains that it lacks sufficient information to make
        the comparison. This is a clear refusal to provide a comparative answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was UNKNOWN (not NO), this
        automatically results in False according to the criteria, regardless of any
        equality comparisons.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" due to lack of information about one person's
        dates. The model indicates it cannot make the comparison.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't determine the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm ("I cannot confirm he died later").
        This makes it a case of "cannot determine" rather than a comparative NO, so
        it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final classification is UNKNOWN (not NO),
        this automatically results in False for question 2. Additionally, the model
        never claimed the death dates were equal - it stated it lacked information
        about one of the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: While the model states "NO", it explicitly says it
        "cannot definitively answer" and lacks information to make the comparison.
        The NO is given due to insufficient evidence rather than as a comparative
        result. This matches the UNKNOWN criteria where "the model indicates it cannot
        make the comparison".

        reached a conclusion about equality since it couldn't determine one person's
        death date.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and explains that it lacks sufficient information

        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't confirm the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm a later
        death date)" - this is explicitly indicating inability to determine the comparison,
        not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category as the model
        is stating it cannot make the determination.

        death, Sun Bin did not die later than Peithon" - this indicates timing but
        doesn't explicitly state they died at exactly the same time as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: While the model gives a NO answer, it's not because
        the values are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Sun Bin died EARLIER
        than Peithon (316 BC vs 315 BC), showing a difference in values as the reason
        for the NO answer.

      explanation_equal_values: The model gave a NO answer because it found that the
        death dates were different (320 BCE vs 317 BCE), not because they were equal.
        It explicitly states "Sun Bin died BEFORE Peithon" as the basis for its NO
        answer.

    dc542306-0e7c-4bc6-a7be-34bacedd9cfb:
      equal_values: 'TRUE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model explicitly states that "both Sun Bin and
        Peithon died in 316 BC" and uses this equality as the primary reason for its
        NO answer ("This means Sun Bin did NOT die later than Peithon"). The NO is
        based on their death dates being exactly the same.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" as its
        final answer after comparing the death dates, making this a definitive NO
        response to the comparison.
      final_answer: 'NO'
      result: UNKNOWN

      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the death dates were
        equal/same/identical. Instead, it explicitly states "Sun Bin died slightly
        earlier than Peithon" and gives specific different years (320 BCE vs 316 BCE).
        The NO answer is based on this difference in timing, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO, Sun Bin did not die
        later than Peithon" as its final comparative conclusion. This is an explicit
        NO answer to whether Sun Bin died later than Peithon.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model
        never reached a NO conclusion, so the question of equal values is not relevant.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot provide a YES
        or NO answer with certainty" and indicates it lacks sufficient information
        to make the comparison. This is a clear case where the model indicates it
        cannot determine the answer.

      explanation_equal_values: Since the final answer was classified as UNKNOWN (not
        NO), this automatically results in False. Additionally, the model never claimed
        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't confirm the comparison
        due to lack of information about one person's dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confirm..." which indicates
        inability to determine the comparison rather than a definitive comparative
        result. This is a case where the model expresses uncertainty about making
        the determination, making it an UNKNOWN rather than a clear NO comparison.

        to make the comparison.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO, I cannot confidently state..."
        which indicates it cannot determine the comparison rather than making a comparative

        the death dates were equal - it simply stated it couldn't confirm the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model states "NO (because I cannot confirm a later
        death date)" - this is explicitly indicating an inability to determine the
        comparison, not a comparative result. This falls under the UNKNOWN category
        as the model is stating it cannot verify or determine the answer.

        the death dates were equal - it stated it lacked information about one of
        the dates.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" but immediately clarifies
        that this NO is due to inability to confirm the comparison ("I cannot confirm
        a later death date"). This makes it a case of being unable to determine rather
        than a comparative result, so it should be classified as UNKNOWN.

        automatically results in False according to the criteria. The model did not
        make a NO comparison based on equal values.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "I cannot responsibly
        give a YES or NO answer" and "I do not have enough information to definitively
        answer this question." This is a clear refusal to make the comparison due
        to insufficient information.
