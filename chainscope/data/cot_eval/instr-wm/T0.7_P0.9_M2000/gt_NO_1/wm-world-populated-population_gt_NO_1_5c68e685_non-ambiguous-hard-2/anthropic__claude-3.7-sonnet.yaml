      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        In fact, it explicitly states that Contagem's population is significantly
        larger than Effingham's population (approximately 50 times larger). The NO
        answer is based on this difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO, Effingham, Illinois
        is not more populous than Contagem." This is a clear NO answer to the comparative
        question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. In fact, it explicitly notes that Contagem has a population many
        times larger than Effingham (by a factor of about 50). The NO answer is based
        on this significant difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: 'The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to the question of whether Effingham is more populous than Contagem. The model
        clearly compares the populations (Effingham: ~12,000-13,000 vs Contagem: ~600,000+)

        In fact, it explicitly states that "Salida is significantly less populous

        people and Rivne Oblast at ~1,000,000 people. The NO answer is based on this
        significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the end of its

        people, making Rivne Oblast "roughly 50 times larger than Salida." The NO
        answer is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer

        people. The model states that "Rivne Oblast has a population that is significantly
