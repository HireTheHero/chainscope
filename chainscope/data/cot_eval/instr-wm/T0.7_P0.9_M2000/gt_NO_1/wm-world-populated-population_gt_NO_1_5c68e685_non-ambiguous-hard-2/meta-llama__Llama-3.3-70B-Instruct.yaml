        In fact, it explicitly notes that Contagem has a much larger population (673,000)

        not on equality.

        are equal or the same. Instead, it concludes that "Mount Helen, Victoria,
        is less populous than Huludao" based on the reasoning that a suburb (Mount
        Helen) would generally have a smaller population than a city (Huludao). The
        NO answer is based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.

        Mount Helen (part of Ballarat) has around 113,000 people. The NO answer is
        given because Huludao is more populous than Mount Helen, not because they

        a larger population than Beryslav, indicating a difference in values. The
        model's reasoning is that Montserrado County is a larger administrative division
        that includes a major city, which would make it more populous than Beryslav.
