      equal_values: 'FALSE'
      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values are equal.
        Instead, it explicitly notes that Contagem's population (over 600,000) is
        "significantly larger" than Effingham's (around 12,000). The NO answer is
        based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer
        in the first word of its response, and then reiterates in its conclusion that
        "Effingham, Illinois, is not more populous than Contagem." This is a direct
        comparative answer to the question.

        to 13,000 residents" while Contagem has "a population exceeding 650,000" and
        describes Contagem as "substantially higher" in population. The NO answer
        is based on this significant difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response and reiterates this with "making the answer **NO**"

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Effingham's population (12,000) is "significantly
        smaller than" Contagem's population (670,000). The NO answer is based on this
        difference in values, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "the answer is **NO**" at
        the end of its response, directly answering whether Effingham, Illinois is

        (around 6,000-7,000)" while Huludao has "a population of approximately 2.5
        million." The model concludes that "Huludao is significantly more populous,"
        which is the reason for the NO answer. The model is clearly indicating a difference

        and providing estimates of "1,000-2,000 residents" for Mount Helen versus
        "~300,000" for Huludao's urban population. The NO answer is based on this
        difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer

        Instead, it explicitly notes a significant difference in population, stating
        that Mount Helen has "around 5,000-10,000" people while Huludao has "an urban
        population of approximately 900,000." The model concludes that "Huludao is
        far more populous," which indicates inequality rather than equality.

        Huludao "has a population exceeding 2 million." The model concludes that "the
        latter is significantly more populous." This is a clear indication of difference,
        not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the main response and in the bolded "**Answer:** NO" at the end. The

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Geiranger has around 200-250 people while
        Harare Province has over 2 million people, describing the difference as "massive"
        and "significantly more populous." The NO answer is based on this difference
        in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of

        Province has "a population exceeding 1.5 million." The model concludes that
        "The vast difference in scale makes Harare Province significantly more populous."
        This indicates inequality, not equality, as the reason for the NO answer.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" at the beginning

        of approximately 316,000 while Palghar District has a population exceeding
        3 million, and concludes that "Palghar is significantly more populous." The
        NO answer is based on this significant difference in population, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, indicating that Panjgur District is not more populous
        than Palghar District. This is a direct answer to the comparative question.

      explanation_equal_values: The model does not state that the values being compared
        are equal. Instead, it explicitly states that Palghar District (2-3 million)
        has a significantly larger population than Panjgur District (250,000-300,000).
        The NO answer is based on this population difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" as its final answer,
        both in the conclusion of its thinking process and in the formal answer at
        the end. The model is directly answering the comparative question with a definitive
        NO.

        Instead, it explicitly notes a significant difference between the populations,
        stating that Panjgur has ~316,000 people while Palghar has ~3-4 million. The
        model concludes that "Palghar District is significantly more populous," which
        is the reason for the NO answer.

        Instead, it explicitly notes that Panjgur has a population of around 316,000
        while Palghar has a population of approximately 2.9 million. The model states
        that "Palghar's population remains significantly larger" which indicates a
        clear difference in values, not equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly and explicitly states "NO" at the
        beginning of its response, and then explains that Panjgur District is not
        more populous than Palghar District. The answer is unambiguous.

        based on this difference in population sizes, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model explicitly states "NO" as its final answer
        to whether Panjgur District is more populous than Palghar District. The answer

      explanation_equal_values: The model did not give a NO answer because the values
        are the same. On the contrary, it explicitly states there is a significant

        while Moradabad had around 887,871 people as of 2011 and likely more now.
        The model describes this as "far more populous" and a "significant" difference.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the beginning of
        its response and then explains that Kusilvak Census Area has a much smaller
        population than Moradabad, providing specific population figures to support
        this conclusion.

        answer is based on this difference, not on equality.
      explanation_final_answer: The model clearly states "NO" at the end of its response,
